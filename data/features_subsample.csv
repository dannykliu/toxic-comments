So as soon as I realized the mistake I uploaded over at Commons and put a deletion request on the local version.  There's seldom any need for the unrestored version of a featured picture to have a hosting locally.  The restored version got featured, though.

 Past tense. (Apologies in advance for any typos - bad keyboard and limited time - also, I'll try to put across a coherent argument without letting emotions get in the way, but I am really angry about this (for reasons I'll explain later)) It is incorrect English to say that events happening over a 22 year span all happened at once (i.e. in the present). For example, to say that """"EastEnders begins"""" is incorrect. EastEnders began. In 1985. The article as it is at the moment (in present tense) reads like EastEnders is a film - with a set end, which we know it is not - it keeps running. It is my strong belief that events that happened in the past in something that runs in real time should also be written in real time (i.e. past tense for things that hapened in the past) - an argument that I have seen all three editors above use at different times. One of the reasons I am angry about this is that certain editors seem to have such a disregard for our language and the way it should be written, that they are willing to forget all about grammar and write this article (which, in my opinion, and as stated by Gungadin elsewhere) is harder to read than it was before, in past tense - just to get this article to FA status - how glory-seeking is that!? Don't get me wrong, it'd be great for this article to get to FA status, but to totally forget about good grammar just because the policy pushers (may I add that WP:TENSE is a guideline, not a policy) say that it needs to be in present tense juts takes the biscuit. WP:TENSE was obviously decided without taking into account real time series - something myself and Elonka have raised on various talk pages to try and change this, but as soon as I have gone away it seems everyone has changed their minds and are happy to have this article written in bad, hard to read English, just to get it to FA status. I say we should have it in readable tense - past - and screw tha FA status. If the voters can't see this is better in past tense, at least we all know it is deserving of FA status anyway - AND readable. -''''''(contribs) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

As with Volvo V70, Nissan Murano, Audi 100 and Honda Odyssey (North America), he inserts the names of car """"designers"""" based on oblique, missing, misleading or spurious references. In the Volvo V70 article, he inserted the name of a dubious designer into an article in such a  way as to leave a direct and referenced quote by the actual designer attributed to his newly introduced spurious designer.

The cooler area [WHERE IS THAT?] then has to """"recharge"""" warmth for several years before another event can take place.[citation needed]

The Madden-Julian Oscillation is not a cause of the phenomena, but propagates eastward around the global tropics with a cycle on the order of 30-60 days, and may significantly influence the speed of development and intensity of El Niño and La Niña. 2.

Tropical cyclones north and south of the equator that may play a role in ENSO are caused by the westerly flow between the areas of low pressure induced by a Madden-Julian oscillation.[4] [WHAT DOES THIS MEAN??]

Such wind may counteract the typical easterly flows across the Pacific and create a tendency toward continuing the eastward motion.[citation needed] [A COUNTERACTION OF EASTERLY FLOWS CREATES TENDENCY TOWARD EASTWARD MOTION??]

Eastward-propagating oceanic Kelvin waves can be produced by Madden-Julian activity, which may in turn be influenced by a developing El Niño, leading to a positive feedback.[5] [HOW IS THIS PRODUCED, HOW IS THIS INFLUENCED?}

My concern in this article is to clarify the Nationality section in the InfoBox of Nonito Donaire page or what country did he really represents. Donaire is a Filipino-American. Why? Because he was born in Talibon, Bohol Province of the PHILIPPINES. He is a natural-born Filipino citizen (by birth and by origin - his Father is a Filipino and a member of the Philippine Army). He is only a dual-citizen of the USA. Therefore, his PRIMARY Nationality is FILIPINO. In BoxRec.com, he was registered as a FILIPINO boxer and the country that he represents is the PHILIPPINES. He was aliased as The FILIPINO Flash, he sings the PHILIPPINE National Anthem before his fight and he and his team carries the PHILIPPINE Flag.

 Packerfansam 

Better to continue the discussion here, I think.

The ANI, in which we both participated, was closed out in June or so with no action, based on her assurances that she understood the nature of the problems she'd occasioned, and a promise to try to stop.  You'll recall that she had been removing references from articles to non-Christian religions and thought, sexual orientation, and sex generally, among other things; and while I was the one to raise this initially at ANI, it is certainly fair to say that I was not the only one to be troubled by these edits.

As the matter wrapped up, I was skeptical that she appreciated the problem (she described it along the lines of """"offending one or two users"""") or that she'd actually quit the problematic editing, but after being characterized as """"overzealous"""" on the point, I withdrew.

She has slowed, but certainly not quit, her POV editing.  A partial list of such edits since then includes:

July 9
At Christianity, without explanation, she recast the “Criticism and apologetics” section as “Arguments and apologetics”, and removed sourced critical commentary by Nietzsche, Bertrand Russell and current Jewish and Muslim theologians, as well as a (sourced) observation by an atheist that some Bible stories may be based on myth.

July 30
At Trois-Rivières, removed without explanation the identification of a (Canadian) Liberal Party politician as “liberal”, as well as a reference to another person’s being the first Jew elected to public office in the British Empire

August 15
She erased, without comment, mention of Hugh Hefner’s attendance at the Art Institute of Chicago.

August 18
She removed proper and wikilinked mention of a notable alum who is best known (and described as) an LGBT activist.

October 15
At Ted Turner, she removed a reliably-sourced quote from Turner declaring himself to be agnostic, claiming it was “contradicted” by info elsewhere in article, when the excised information was more recent than the “contradictory” text and, indeed, nicely illustrated the point (in the source itself), which is that Turner has waffled on the issue over the years.

Here too I am not the only editor to remain concerned - see this Talk page entry from September.

I agree that the """"party school"""" edit to the University of Wisconsin is, in the larger picture, kind of a silly thing; but between her registered account and the IP she sometimes edits from, she has made the same edit at least four times now - see May 15, June 13, October 3 in addition to today's.  And to be clear, she's not removing the """"party school"""" material but just the (perfectly good) citation to Playboy.  Indeed in her October 3 entry, she updated the """"party school"""" rankings to 2015 and went out and found a different source to insert in Playboy's stead.

So I take your point, that maybe this particular edit is a trivial thing to template her on; but she has continued her practice (albeit slowed) of idiosyncratic, unexplained or deceptively described removal of content for reasons that can only be explained as in furtherance of a personal point of view.  I don't think that such editing should pass without at least occasional comment, and that's what I did.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Where does he maintain that angels are defined as """"more graceful versions of homo sapiens?""""

 Completion date 

Once again, someone has changed the completion date to 30 June '09, though this time they have modified the reference so it no longer shows the photo with the billboard saying 30 Dec '08.  The new reference is now to the main page at http://burjdubaiskyscraper.com which does indeed say 30 June '09.  My question is: can burjdubaiskyscraper.com be considered a reliable source?

I think we should change the completion to 2009, but not include an exact date.  Since burjdubaiskyscraper.com is just a third-party site, I do not think they can be trusted with knowing the official information.  But, Emporis.com does have a completion date of 2009; they can be trusted.  Also, I do not know how anyone can know the exact date of the completion of a building.  It would be best to just stick to the year.   (talk | contributions) 

    

 Height in early March 2008 

Several editors have changed the height of the Burj Dubai from 604.9 m to 611.3 m.  I have changed it back to 604.9 metres as no official statment has yet been made by Emaar.  I propose that the height not be changed unless Emaar makes an official statement or there is a change of the height on the Burj Dubai's official site: www.burjdubai.com.  Since only the developer knows the exact height, we should not use any updates or information from other sources.  Once the height on the official website is updated should we change the height here on Wikipedia.   (talk | contributions) 
I agree.  One official source is better than many conflicting unofficial sources.    

 Remaining milestones 
I have my doubts whether the Petronius oil platform qualifies as a """"world's tallest freestanding structure"""" and as a milestone for Burj Dubai to pass.  Most of it's structure is below water and therefore doesn't qualify under CTBUH rules.    
I do not have an opinion on the issue, just a few comments.  Consensus is that it is not considered the tallest; and therefore may not warrant being included as a milestone.  But, despite that, it does stand taller than the CN Tower, even if it is in water.  It will not hurt if we keep it, and will not be a major deal if we take it away.  Let us see if anyone else has an opinion.   (talk | contributions) 

 At this rate, we gotta keep all those deep level mines too since they are much 'taller' than any tower or oil platform ever built.
  

Actually, many argue that the Petronius is the """"tallest free-standing structure"""", hence the usual addition of """"on land"""" to the Burj Dubai's title (for now), and previously to the CN Tower's title. So I don't agree that consensus agrees to the contrary; consensus agrees that it is not on land, but there is much support of it being a free-standing structure in general. CTBUH has never released any information about the world's tallest structures; it only measures the height of the tallest buildings, so by its rules the CN Tower also would not count. It is therefore not very relevant in this situation. Anyway, I believe that the Petronius should be kept as a milestone. Cheers, -me 

Would Petronius stand on it's own without buoyancy?   
 Even if it can, a lot of the difficulty of a tall structure is in the construction process.  Oil rigs have a serious advantage there because they don't need tall cranes, because you can access the top with boats.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 32.97.110.142

 Documented fraud and corruption at Wikipedia etc... 

September 4, 2008
 

Wikimedia Foundation Inc.
P.O. Box 78350
San Francisco, CA 94107-8350
Organized under the laws of the State of Florida
 
 
 
Re: Documented fraud and corruption at Wikipedia etc.., and much more...
 

Attn: Mr. Jimmy Wales, Mr. Michael Snow and Mr. Godwin and all concerned parties.
 

Dear Wikipedia, Wikinews and Wikimedia Foundation Inc., etc...   The following serious issues can be addressed and handled, either by a respected mutual resolution or through legal action.  
 
1) Via documented corruption and fraud, certain Wikipedia editors and administrators, notably Blackpearl14 and Lessheard vanU have openly accused, I,  Royce Mathew of “harassment”, “attacking”  “stalking” and such.   Utilizing their unique power, tools and resources provided by Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation Inc., they blatantly sought out and continue to seek out to threaten, hurt and damage contributing writers.   These are serious allegations.  However their corruption is not limited to themselves.   Other editors and administrators are part of their network, who works with them in their purposely threatening and deliberate destructive operation.  Wikipedia’s computer history has documented their actions.  Photos are available.  However, I firmly advise Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation Inc., to also preserve all of the evidence in light of possible litigation.
 
2) On or about September 2, 2008, Blackpearl14 ,who had already gone through various identity changes as allowed by Wikipedia, who is afforded certain power, tools and resources by Wikinews,  Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation, has deliberately and deceitfully edited my complaint letter posted on the Wikipedia’s administrators “talk” complaint board.  She even cut out an entire paragraph from it.  This was done without my knowledge, nor with my permission and is completely unacceptable.  As electronic history recorded it, this was done to remove reported transcript evidence of her own self confessed bias, her own personal agenda, her own particular goals and her own self business associated with Wikipedia directly exploiting Wikipedia, it’s articles and the power provided to her.   She also had made changes to her own personal bio pages after I sent her a copy of the letter, acting as if the transcript sources didn’t exist.  After doing these corrupt acts, Blackpearl14 continued right on with her serious allegations against me.   She had responded directly below the adulterated letter.   Thus with her fraudulent and evident criminal acts, Blackpearl14  had corruptly altered and modified a letter to be deliberately representative of me, falsely presented it as being from me, and then herself and some of her fellow editors and administrators answered the letter as though they had only just read it.   Using the tools, resources, and privileged authority, Blackpearl14 continues to succeed in leveling serious charges against me, even falsely accusing me of modifying her bio, adulterating my talk correspondence which sought intervention, and meanwhile her peers of editors and administrators, had aided her acts.  To prevent any “undo” of Blackpearl14 deliberate adulteration of my letter, I was also blocked and any attempt to post a copy of the letter to yet again notify the administration of the serious issues at hand, were immediately deleted by Slakr.  They are a wild gang with free total control, provided by Wikinews,  Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation, with which to recklessly cause harm and destruction, and wrongfully threaten and silence their victims.   Wikipedia’s computer history has documented hers, her peers, editors and administrators continual acts.   Photos are available.  However, I firmly advise Wikipedia and Wikimedia Foundation Inc.,  to also preserve all of the evidence in light of possible litigation.
 
3) As documented, Blackpearl14's own statements and declarations are from the same person who with her fellow editors and administrators continue to uphold double standards, and level serious charges against me, including that I and other writers were bias about Pirates of the Caribbean and the Walt Disney Company and that I and other writers weren’t being neutral about Pirates of the Caribbean, and then used their powers, tools and resources afford to them by Wikipedia, Wikinews and Wikimedia Foundation Inc., with which to engage in various reckless and corrupt acts against me.  For quick review, here is a collection of some of BLACKPEARL14 (uses various alias wikipedia names) self published bia quotes from 2007-through August 2008, on her own pages, as history recorded it, done by her, which she has clearly stated her bias purpose, her own bias causes and her own bias business.   “I am Pirate Lord-ess of the Caribbean Sea",0,0,0,0,0,0

See the problem is that while pushing people around and being nasty to them, might make you feel ever so important, what really happens is that all you do is make more people not like you.

It's called the cycle of abuse and neglect; You abuse other people and they neglect you, so to make youself feel all important; your now trying to make them pay attention to you by being even more nasty to them and others; and again - they and even more people want to have nothing to do with you.

There really are no bonus points to be had in being a bully who is nasty to everyone; but again you are responsible for making yourself into that kind of a person; so therefore it's a personal problem that is up to you to resolve by taking responsibility for the fact that you are choosing to be nasty to other people.

As to what you do about your problem - which is you and your attitude towards others and how you treat them; is really nothing to do with me.

So anyway, I am off to have a great day.

Yes you are correct I do beleive that the Arbitration process in Wikipedia is crap. The vast majority of cases these days are just one editor or a group of editors trying to force their way on others. It is no longer about doing the right thing for the project. Regarding helping out at AE, I do wholeheartedly agree it would be good for more admins to get involved and that is true of many areas of WP not just AE. Part of the problem is that most admins are given the toolset because they keep their heads down and do not get involved in these areas. Those that do, much like myself, are too """"untrustworthy"""" or """"lack the proper temperment"""" to be admins. So its a never ending, self perpetuating cycle of promoting the sheep to guard against the wolf. Also, more than one (editor and admin alike) has voiced that they feel that you don't listen to comments at AE and largely do what you want, so why would they help out?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Basically I agree that since there are diverse assessments in various RS on the topic of this article, all statements should be sourced. 
You mention a """"consensus theory"""" that includes Germany along with Italy (1918-1945), which is something with which most people would not disagree. The time frames are relevant to discussions of the left-right political spectrum characterizations, etc. As pointed out in Great_depression#Germany, for example, the Great Depression had a severe impact on the unemployment in the Weimar_republic#Onset_of_the_Great_Depression, facilitating the rise of the National Socialist party, etc.
It would seem evident that monumental disasters like the Great Depression had an effect on the ideology of Fascism and other movements as well. I'm sure that the sources address these issues much more thoroughly than is reflected in our article. For example, the following paragraph cites no sources whatsoever, does not even include a Wikilink to the Weimar Republic article, and seems to be generally lackingThe events of the Great Depression resulted in an international surge of fascism and the creation of several fascist regimes and regimes that adopted fascist policies. The most important new fascist regime was Nazi Germany, under the leadership of Adolf Hitler. With the rise of Hitler and the Nazis to power in 1933, liberal democracy was dissolved in Germany, and the Nazis mobilized the country for war, with expansionist territorial aims against several countries. In the 1930s the Nazis implemented racial laws that deliberately discriminated against, disenfranchised, and persecuted Jews and other racial and minority groups. 連絡 見学/迷惑 """,0,0,0,0,0,0

12 active, 8 inactive or slightly active = 60% active

If this is roughly accurate, then the number of active admins is probably around 300 or less. (I don't know how many total editors were active in the last 30 days). While some admins involve themselves in setting policies (which anyone may participate in), others seem to confine themselves to truly janitorial work. For that reason I'm not sure if """"bureaucracy"""" is the best way to describe the corps of admins, or the dangers threatened by their expansion. The more plausible fear, I think, is that too many admins will result in a """"police state"""", with more sped-up deletes, heavy-handed blocks, and POV enforcement. I am certainly opposed to any movement in the direction of stifling unpopular POVs. I'm not sure that the number of admins is the major factor though. Another view, which I don't endorse either, is that having more admins broadens involvement and reduces the relative power of any one admin. I think that the most important issues are probably the rules and procedures, official and unofficial, that admins follow and/or enforce on others, Those powers should stay limited. - 05:26, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)

Also- Thanks for your support for my adminship. Maybe we should limit the number of admins to 500. ;) Cheers, - 05:26, Jun 21, 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

After the Christian population of the bishoprics of Skopje and Ohrid voted in 1874 overwhelmingly in favour of joining the Exarchate (Skopje by 91%, Ohrid by 97%), the Bulgarian Exarchate became in control of the whole of Vardar and Pirin Macedonia. The Exarchate was also represented in the whole of southern Macedonia. The “Macedonian Question,” became especially prominent after the Balkan wars in 1912-1913 and the subsequent division of Macedonia between the three neighboring states, followed by tensions between them over possession of Macedonia. This partitioning of the territory had a tremendous influence on the development of the Macedonian national identity.Center for Documentation and Information on Minorities in Europe - Southeast Europe (CEDIME-SE)MINORITIES IN SOUTHEAST EUROPE - Macedonians of Bulgaria, pg. 6  In order to legitimise their claims, each of these countries tried to 'persuade' the population into allegiance. Paul Fouracre. Cambridge Encyclopedia of Medieval History Some scientists argue also that the use of any ethnic definition of the Slav speekers in Macedonia during the 19th and early 20th Century did not refer to ethnicity, but rather a socio-occupational description. The Slav population in Macedonia tended to be Christian peasents, farming folk,The Macedonian Conflict: Ethnic Nationalism in a Transnational World - Loring M. Danforth, ISBN13: 978-0-691-04356-2 attested socio-political circumstances, such as in what language the local schooling was provided, or whether the local church aligned itself with Serbian, Bulgarian or Greek Orthodoxy. The majority were under the influence of the Bulgarian Exarchate and its education system, thus in the early 20th century and beyond, were regarded as Bulgarians, whatever that meant.(Brubaker 1996: 153; Ruhl 1916: 6; Perry in Lorrabee 1994: 61)The 1911 Encyclopedia Britannica. The Races and Religions of Macedonia, """"National Geographic"""", November 1912. Carnegie Endowment for International peace.REPORT OF THE INTERNATIONAL COMMISSION. To Inquire into the causes and Conduct OF THE BALKAN WARS, PUBLISHED BY THE ENDOWMENT WASHINGTON, D.C. 1914  However, the key events in the formation of a distinctive Macedonian identity emerged during the first half of the 20th century in the aftermath of the Balkan Wars of 1912-1913 when the Bulgarian Exarchate discontinued its activity in most of the region. The process strengthed especially following the Second World War, with the withdrawal of Bulgarian authorities from Macedonia, the establishment of Yugoslav Macedonian Republic and the signing of Bled agreement. With the founding of the People's Republic of Macedonia in 1944 as part of SFRY, a sense of a Macedonian national identity gained strength and became systematised.(Bell 1998:193) The Yugoslav government began a policy of removing any Bulgarian influence and cementing the Macedonian identity.Europe since 1945.

Scope of the article
David Art's book is mentioned in the article, so I think a good starting point should be what he wrote:  """"In this book, I use """"far right"""" as an umbrella term for any political party, voluntary association, or extraparliamentary movement that differentiates itself from the mainstream right....""""Radical right"""" refers to a specific type of far right party that began to emerge in the late 1970s....[T]here has been a convergence around the term in the literature...."""" (Inside the Radical Right: The Development of Anti-Immigrant Parties in Western Europe (2011), p. 10)  He then says his definition draws from Betz (1994) and Mudde (2007).

My first comment is that since Art says there is convergence on use of the term we should not use in text attribution.  We should just acknowledge that while there is no consistency on terminology, the term normally refers to the wave of right-wing parties that began to emerge in the 1970s.  We should only  use in-text attribution when someone says something original.  For example Art refers to Betz when he provides Betz's explanation of why these parties are right-wing.

Second, we need to ensure that the article is about a specific topic, in this case the parties and groups that began to emerge in the late 70s, and include only comments about these parties where the author is clearly referring to them.  For example, some writers use the term radical right to refer to parties such as the BNP but not UKIP.  Other writers may not use the term radial right but may call them """"third wave"""" of the Extreme Right Party family, as Mudde did in his 1996 article """"The War of Words Defining the Extreme Right Party Family.""""  Incidentally we should have an article that family too.  It's definition is similar to Art's use of """"far right"""", although that term is more usually used for the more right-wing of the Extreme Right Parties, such as the BNP.

Is Deor out to lunch ?

Here Logicus posts a serious query about Deor's fitness to be meddling with Wikipedia articles that is posted on the Celestial Spheres Talk page, for a serious answer by Deor that he has not provided in spite or repeated challenges to do so.

Police Constable Deor ? Logicus says No !

Imperious User Deor has elected to set himself up as Police Constable Wikipedian who polices Wikipedia and reports breaches of what he imagines to be its rules and breaches of its rules to its administrators. Here we present Deor's latest arrogant imperious mistaken comments posted to Logicus's User Talk page for everybody to read 

""""[edit] Celestial spheres redux
I'm going to revert your additions and deletions once again. Repeatedly adding material that is not relevant to the article's topic and, in essence, constitutes an original synthesis of material in primary sources is disruptive and impermissible in Wikipedia. Any further disruption at this article will be brought up at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents, as you have repeatedly attempted to insert your original research and personal interpretations of historical sources into multiple articles. This is an encyclopedia that relies on information gleaned from secondary sources, not a forum for posting what appears to individuals to be """"logically"""" inferrable from the historical record. Deor (talk) 

Retrieved from """"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Logicus"""" """"

But on the cardinal issue here of relevance, it should be self-evident to one and all that any material on the causes of the motions of the celestial spheres, such as the theory of Buridan, is of absolutely central relevance to any article on the celestial spheres and their motions. And yet Wiki User Deor repeatedly seeks to deny this, and under repeated challenge to provide any rational justification for this unjustifiable POV, repeatedly fails to do so.  Why is this ? Should User Deor be banned from meddling with Wikipedia articles because of his severe anti-educational tendency. [Watch this space !]  Logicus

Is Deor wrong about Ptolemy's alleged instrumentalism ?

In connection with Logicus's 27 June proposed deletion of the Celestial spheres article's 
following claim 

“Through the use of the epicycle, eccentric, and equant, this model of compound circular motions could account for all the irregularities of a planet's apparent movements in the sky.[7][8]

as either false or meaningless and its replacement with a meaningful and historically truthful assessment of Ptolemy's achievement, on the 22nd of June in Celestial spheres Talk,  you claimed it is a possibility """"that Ptolemy, for one, didn't devote much thought to the problems and consequences associated with positing the physical existence of spheres, epicyles, etc. Deor (talk) """"

Logicus then pointed out to you that it seems this is not a possibility on the evidence of Ptolemy's Planetary Hypotheses, and also provided a quotation from the Introduction of Langermann's 1990 English language edition of Alhazen's Configuration of the World , which quotes Ptolemy's views in his Planetary Hypotheses on the two possible physical forms of the celestial bodies, as follows:

""""In Book II [of Planetary Hypotheses] Ptolemy undertakes to establish the shapes of the bodies that carry out the heavenly motions....He states 

'For each of these motions, which are different in quantity or kind, there is a body that moves freely on poles and in space and which has a special place...'

Ptolemy then postulates two possible paths of approach to the physical explanation of the workings of the cosmos.

So do you question your own ability to separate your personal opinion from your editorial duties?

Both of you make good points about the OED: it's not OR, but it probably should be cited to a reliable source for the analysis, like the Yassky article.  I think the WP:NAME point is a good one, too  maybe this article should be moved back to its old name.

 That is fine that you have set out your views. I have set out mine and when I am accused to talking 'nonsense' for expressing those views I will respond likewise. That you decide you do not like my reaction does not give you or those of your frame of mind the right to starve my views of the oxygen of publicity, as one nice Englishwoman put it in 1988. I do not have to accept any British nomenclature for my home. I live in Ireland; I therefore am Irish. I live in Europe; I therefore am a European. To claim that I live in what British people have termed the """"British Isles"""" is, despite the wire-balancing act by some wikipedia editors, ultimately an explicit claim that I am British. That, son, is a profoundly political claim. It is hostile, aggressive and completely about imposing a British nationalist identity upon me, my family and everybody I know. It doesn't get any more political. Anybody who partakes in that British nationalist project is of that 'national disposition'. They are aligning themselves with that agenda for who I am. You cannot censor this view simply because it doesn't accord with your British Comics outlook on the world. While you were reading British Comics I was reading books like Edward Said's Orientalism (book) and Declan Kiberd's Inventing Ireland (book), both of which are books that emphasise the importance to colonial powers of controlling the representation of countries they have conquered. Claiming Ireland to be in this """"British Isles"""" is precisely about that, about controlling Irish identity, Irish direction.

Grandmaster, don't get offended but up to now you have demonstrated that you have no clue of what you are talking about. Taking Nakhichevan as a whole, in its pick, the population jumped to 150,000, it was its most important period, after the 13th century it was replaced, in 14th century, it droped to about half of its prior population, it lost its statue, at 15th century it was taken over by Armenians from the vicinities of Van, and after the desertion of Ani, people moved there. Julfa alone represented a significant portion of the entire population. The closest to the Abbas period you cam is of over 200 years, while I provided data which covered that period. You are the one making up things which you can in no way backup. Here, let readd the materials I have provided.

For the next four centuries, Armenians, who had begun their dispersion after the fall of Ani and the Seljuk Turkish invasions in the eleventh century, continued to emigrate. In the meantime, Persia ( Iran) experienced a revival under the Shi'i Safavids, who became the adversaries of the Sunni Ottomans. From 1501 until 1639, the two fought each other periodically in Armenia. Armenians were uprooted during these wars, and, in 1604, some 250,000 Armenians were forcibly transferred by Shah 'Abbas to Iran. By the seventeenth century, the Armenians had become a minority in parts of their historic lands. The merchants of Julfa in Nakhichevan were among those who were brought to Iran by Shah 'Abbas; he moved them to a suburb of Isfahan where they built the New Julfa community. The support of 'Abbas and subsequent shahs enabled the Armenians to expand Iran's trade with India, China, Russia, and Western Europe. These merchants helped to make the Persian Gulf an important trade center. An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires by James S. Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas C. J. Pappas. p. 44

Shah Abbas devastated his frontier areas, which included parts of Armenia, as a defensive measure and so displaced nearly all the population. [from it] He settled some 13,000 families in the silk-growing northern provinces of Gilan and Mazanderan bordering on the Caspian. (Source: The Armenians and the East India Company in Persia in the Seventeenth and Early Eighteenth Centuries by R. W. Ferrier, The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 26, No. 1 (1973), p. 39)

Linda K. Steinmann in her work Shah 'Abbas and the Royal Silk Trade 1599-1629, Vol. 14, No. 1 (1987), pp. 68-74 covers the evacuation of the Armenians, and to a lesser extent elsewhere of Georgians, but nowhere does she say anything about any evacuation of Tartars.

Ina Baghdiantz McCabe covers the evacuation in her work The Shah's Silk for Europe's Silver: The Eurasian Trade of the Julfa Armenians in Safavid Iran and India (1530-1750), I don't see anything about Tartars being evacuated or an undiscriminate evacuation, or any reference of an important Tartar population in Nakhichevan.

Josepho Barbaro while visiting the devastation reports destruction of Armenian towns and its desertion, not Tartars.

Sir William Ouseley during his visit in 1812 has only discribed the destruction of the Armenian city during the evacuation.

In 1603 Shah 'Abbas, the great Safavid ruler of Persia, sent an expedition into Armenia in answer to the appeals of the inhabitants for assistance against the Turks. The death of the Sultan Mahmud III in December 1603 and the succession of his son Ahmed, a boy of twelve, opened the way to an easy conquest in the course of which both retreating Turks and invading Persians plundered the Armenians. The Persian victory was followed by a forced emigration of the population to the Shah's capital of Isfahan. « That dragon of hell, Shah Abbas, nourished from the beginning in the ways of the serpent, saw with an eye of envy the prosperity of the Christians. » So Arakel of Tauriz, the seventeenth-century Armenian historian, puts it, and it was indeed the skill of new... Armenia was left desolates... (A Seventeenth-Century typological cycle of paintings in the Armenian cathedal at Julfa, T. S. R. Boase, Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 13, No. 3/4 pp.323-324)

D.M. Lang writes that one of the two major reasons of the deportation was: ...he desired to make use of the industrial and commercial talents of the Armenians...

I am really disappointed with the dictatorship you Wikipedia administrators carry out.
In your particular case, you still want to imagine you are living in the Meiji era. Okinawa is NOT another country anymore; the Okinawan tongue is a dialect of Japanese, like it or not (it was established so by the government years ago, after carrying out extensive linguistic research, and realizing the grammar is the same) (Palau, Korean, and Ainu are clearly not related).
I can't understand how Wikipedia can let a soldier, a brutish animal without intelligence, closer to the neanderthal than to the homo sapiens, have more authority editing articles than an expert in the subject.
And you Americans are clearly the most retarded people on Earth. Now I see why Americans in Japan can only get the ugliest and most retarded women out there. Bitches who, if they don't marry a dumb American, will end up single forever.

in regards with laws, your actions are a direct violation of  Privacy_laws_of_the_United_States, as well as Wiki rules. Please do not attack other editors. If you continue, you will be blocked from editing Wikipedia. 

In regards with discussions, this is NOT a place for arguments. In regards with encyclopedia style, the article needs to fit in it in order to stay in Wiki, and attempts to re-write it into another style do nothing but harm.

In regards with the article factual sense, there is nothing to argue about. There is no evidence proving that nomads fight tested the dogs versus fighting them """"just for money"""". Same applies to modern times. Not to mention that nomads did NOT develop the breed initially, because the breed was originally established by whoever was raising sheep or goats, while nomads were traveling, so they helped to spread it. As per fighting dogs of this breed in some countries, there is already a clear outline in this article already.   

However, there are factual materials that some of so-called """"fight test"""" aimed to measure the aggression towards strange unfriendly dogs or other large predators entering  protected premises. This applies to dogs of either gender. As well, there are several cases of successful re-introduction of dogs from kennels that run so-called """"fighting tests"""" to livestock guardians duties, in different countries. As well, the free range farming is on the rise in Russia, and the livestock guardian dogs are in demand. The pit-like dogs, pit mixes and commercial fights is one thing; the necessity to maintain aggression towards predators to protect the herd from strays is a totally different issue.

 Editing own comments 

In the context of misrepresentation, may I draw your attention to WP:Talk:

'Altering a comment after it has been replied to robs the reply of its original context. It can also be confusing. Before you change, consider taking one of the following steps:
 Contact the person(s) who replied (through their talk page) and ask if it is okay to delete or change your text.
 use strike-through or a place-holder to show the comment has been altered.
 Strike-through is typed like this and ends up like this.
 A placeholder is a phrase such as """"[Thoughtless and stupid comment removed by the author.]"""". This will ensure that your fellow editors' irritated responses still make sense. In turn, they may then wish to replace their reply with something like, """"[Irritated response to deleted comment removed. Apology accepted.]""""

Your reverts of the Ankit Fadia article state that you're """"removing material not supported by sources or cited to unreliable sources"""" So with that, there are 1741 mentions of Chennai Online, do you plan on deleting those passages in Wikipedia articles
mentioning Chennai Online as a source?

Granted there are one mention of Wendy McAuliffe and its in the Ankit Fadia article but there are 35,700 results for """"Wendy McAuliffe"""" ZDNet in Google, and at her current venture about page http://www.populatedigital.com/people/ mentions """"Wendy began her career as a journalist for ZDNet, the UK’s leading online technology newswire, during which time she became a leading authority in online privacy and child protection online."""" so that's another unreliable sources?!?

Surely an article about Ankit Fadia by Suelette Dreyfus is a reliable source, but you nixed that too.

You point to the notability page and revert the page, and I see in that document that Wikipedia is not a promotional medium, the way that article is after you revert the page, it turns into a promotional medium for Ankit Fadia, without the other articles supporting that Ankit Fadia is a phony, then have the issue of unclear notability to which having an article about Ankit Fadia. If notability requires verifiable evidence, how many mainstream and researched articles pointing out are needed to point out that Ankit Fadia is a verifiable phony? 

I can't take these donation drives for Wikipedia seriously if the basis for articles on Wikipedia are given to people with no grasp of their field, and hardcore plagiarism of other people's work without and accepting them as your own original work.
The research is there, maybe I'm not the editor for putting this together, but either Wikipedia should delete the article or stop sugar coating this article as a one sided promotional medium for Ankit Fadia.

 Needs references, balance 

Hello. I'd like to suggest some edits. I tried editing Wikipedia a long time ago and had a terrible experience, and I can't even remember the protocol since it's been so long, so I thought it'd be safer to post suggestions here and let someone else who's more in the know roll with them if they'd like to.

 The introduction states, """"The prescribing labels of some SSRIs note the possibility of 'intolerable' discontinuation reactions. Some patients have extreme difficulty discontinuing use of SSRI drugs.""""  Not only are these claims not referenced, but they're misleading, given that the vast majority of patients, if they experience this syndrome, do not find the reactions intolerable and don't have """"extreme difficulty"""" discontinuing. The introduction also says studies demonstrate """"statistically and clinically significant indications of difficulties with the discontinuing of SSRIs,"""" thus further espousing the difficulties of discontinuing SSRIs without balancing that with the fact that most people don't have major problems.

 In the history section, last paragraph, fluoxetine is said to have """"the highest number of drug dependence reports."""" The WHO site was down when I tried to check the reference, so I don't know what year that report was from or whether it really says people become dependent on fluoxetine (given that the quoted paragraph above this claim, from WHO, seems to dispute that notion), but to my understanding, it's generally accepted that people do not become dependent on antidepressants, in the way that the general public thinks of dependence.

 The controversy section is completely one-sided. Arguments from critics are explained in detail, but the other sides are not. There is no indication that these criticisms are from the minority or have evidence against them.

Overall, parts of this article seem misleading to me, and it concerns me because many myths and baseless fear mongering is out there about antidepressants already. People who are depressed deserve to know the facts, and to understand that these drugs are approved because the benefits far outweigh the risks, according to mainstream medicine. This is literally a life-or-death topic and must be handled in an unbiased manner. I'm obviously not arguing for side effects and concerns to be deleted. I'm urging for them to be presented appropriately, with the weight that most experts believe they actually carryno more and no less.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

This was never meant to turn into an essay or a Big Deal. However, in September, I decided to reveal to the WP community that I'd been on antidepressant medication, and have had an 'interesting' history regarding depression and self-injury. Another editor, now banned, had decided to take it upon himself to bully me over the fact that yes, I have had a history of depression and that I was popping pills like smarties. Obviously, it was something to be ashamed of and something which made me a lesser person, an unstable and unworthy one.

I decided to tell the truth, then take a break. I'd never have foreseen what was going to happen next.

The community spoke out, and spoke out clearly and pretty much with one voice. Of the list of people below who commented, I see dear friends, strangers and people who are vehemently set against each other - all saying the same thing.

When I came back here, I was just going to delete my public statement, check for fallout and (hopefully) get back to work. However, I'm keeping it here as a message to all others who have been through this too, or are going through it right now. My email inbox is filled up right now with """"me too"""" messages from all sorts of people on here; editors, admins, even two chronic vandals, and all in a very similar situation.

This is what the community has to say;

To other people out there who are hiding or are afraid or ashamed of what people might think, or are feeling worthless and unloved, read through the list below, because so many of these good people are also speaking to you.

I want to thank everyone here for being so loving, trusting and supportive of me here. I truly don't know what to say ...

Definition of Islamophobia

pho·bi·a (fō'bē-ə): A persistent, abnormal, and irrational fear of a specific thing or situation that compels one to avoid it, despite the awareness and reassurance that it is not dangeroushttp://dictionary.reference.com/browse/Phobia.

 According to the Organisation of The Islamic Conference: 
""""Islamophobia signifies the contemporary proliferation of discrimination against Muslims and distortion of Islam and is partly due to the ignorance and lack of understanding of Islam in the West. It would be an unfortunate error in judgment in believing that Islam is linked to terror; that it is intolerant of other religious beliefs, that its values and practices are not democratic; that it favors repression of freedom of expression and undermining human rights.""""http://www.oic-oci.org/uploads/file/Islamphobia/Islamophobia_rep_May_23_25_2009.pdf

The removed paragraph 
Slovakization is often rationalized as a response to forced magyarization, which happened mainly after the Ausgleich (Compromise of 1867). While no one now considers magyarization a positive trend, for several reasons the rationalization of slovakization as a response to it is questionable: magyarization happened during the times of the monarchy, and it happened in a time period when human rights were not considered nearly as universal as now. Slovakization is happening since then and it was as severe under communist dictatorship as it is now in democratic

 Archives 
 Archive 1 Friday 12th August 2005  Talk:Jack Abramoff/Archive 1 I made some substantial edits to the page and archived the entire earlier talk since it was mostly to do items since dealt with. 

COPYVIO
This article and it's sister screed are embarrassments to wikipedia.  They're essentially the same and both reflect the authors politocal hatred and zeal.  Both also have severe irredemable copyright problems and are and embarrasment to wikipedia.  They need to be deleted immediately.   

Alot of this article DOES seem to be a blatent copyvio.  Tyco, as below, was edited (the text was accurate, but half the news story was pasted in here).  You cannot just wholesale paste in paragraphs of text from a news story, attribute a link, and it not be a copywrite violation.  It's called Plagerism. 
  
 Tyco 
Almost the whole tyco section is a blatent rip from the WAPO article.  I've removed  part of it, as it needs to be re-written. 

I think I've cleaned much of the CopyVio stuff up, hopefully.  There is alot of non-essential stuff in this article about peripheral people, and not about Abramoff, however.  It needs to be cleaned up more, as the article meanders alot here and there.  

I reverted some things you took out (outside the Tyco section), like in the """"Early years"""" section and in the intro about DeLay. That material is not copyright infringement because it is properly sourced when directly quoted.  

It still needs to be rewritten to not be a direct copy paste unless you are going to quote it.  Just providing a link is not attribution, and copying entire paragraphs out of an article is plagiarism, not 'fair use' unless you are quoting. Also, if you are going to say 'the los angeles times reports' you need to source the times, not a 
secondary source (i.e. democracy now).

I modified the quote and attributed properly.

 

The speech from Tom DeLay is a direct quote (it's in quotations) so of course it is taken word-for-word from the source. I'll tweak the setup to the quote a little better as per your request. Here's the primary source for the other thing.  

No problem.  If I see something that is probable CopyVio I tend to chop it out first, and then rework it (I don't usually just leave it out, if the quote is accurate).  Btw have you found a link for the franken quote, I can't find anything other than on blogs.  Honestly I'm not sure what the relevence to an article on Abramoff is, really, anyway.

 The """"forced abortions"""" part was originally reported by Brian Ross at ABC News for 20/20 on March 13, 1998. It also appears in Al Franken's book The Truth (with jokes)'' in the """"Tom DeLay Saipan Sex Tour and Jack Abramoff Casino Getaway"""" chapter. Since we've agreed that primary sources are key, i've change the attribution in the article.  

 The Indian tribes scandal 
 
This area is a mess, I have tried to clean it up a bit and structure it better. It may be best to create a new page on the tribes scam and point the Reed, Norquist etc pages to it.

Basically we need fewer facts and more context. At the moment the page is simply a list of transactions that may or may not have been legit with a strong implication that they were not legit. 

I moved the whole scandal to its own page.

 More information on Lenin's partial Jewish ancestry 
The following quotes regarding Lenin's partial Jewish ancestry are from The Jewish Century by Yuri Slezkine (Princeton University Press, 2004) and could possibly be inserted in to this article in order to provide more references.

 """"But of course the most sensitive """"nationality"""" [ethnicity] of all was Lenin's. In 1924, Lenin's sister Anna discovered that their maternal grandfather, Aleksandr Dmitrievich Blank, had been born Srul (Israel), the son of Moshko Itskovich Blank, in the shtetl Starokonstantinov [Old Konstantinov] in Volynia [Volhynia, now Ukraine]. When Kamenev found out, he said, """"I've always thought so,"""" to which Bukharin allegedly replied: """"Who cares what you think? The question is, what are we going to do?"""" What """"they,"""" or rather, the Party through the Lenin Institute, did was proclaim this fact """"inappropriate for publication"""" and decree that it be """"kept secret."""" In 1932 and again in 1934, Anna Ilinichna [Lenin's sister] begged Stalin to reconsider, claiming that her discovery was, on the one hand, an important scientific confirmation of the """"exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe"""" and """"the extraordinarily beneficial influence of its blood on the offspring of mixed marriages""""; and, on the other, a potent weapon against anti-Semitism """"owing to the prestige and love that [Vladimir] Ilich [Lenin] enjoys among the masses."""" Lenin's own Jewishness, she argued, was the best proof of the accuracy of his view that the Jewish nation possessed a peculiar """"'tenacity' in struggle"""" and a highly revolutionary disposition. """"Generally speaking,"""" she concluded, """"I do not understand what reasons we, as Communists, may have for concealing this fact. Logically, this does not follow from the recognition of the full equality of all nationalities."""" Stalin's response was an order to """"keep absolutely quiet."""" Anna Ilinichna did. The enemies of the regime were deprived of additional anti-Semitic ammunition"""" (pgs. 245–246)

 """"All advanced Jews supported assimilation, according to Lenin, but it is also true that many of the """"great leaders of democracy and socialism"""" came from """"the best representatives of the Jewish world."""" Lenin himself did [have Jewish ancestry], through his maternal grandfather, although he probably did not know it. When his sister, Anna, found out, she wrote to Stalin that she was not surprised, and """"this fact"""" was """"another proof of the exceptional ability of the Semitic tribe,"""" and that Lenin had always contrasted """"what he called its 'tenacity' in struggle with the more sluggish and lackadaisical Russian character."""" (p. 163)

 """"And in 1965, all archival documents relating to Lenin's Jewish grandfather were ordered """"removed without leaving any copies."""" (pg. 338)

Thanks! Your copyedits are much appreciated, as is the advice. To reply to your points:
I was afraid that the section about his books rambled a bit, although I want to make sure to keep enough of it in. Especially in Szigeti on the Violin, he reveals a lot about his personal philosophy of music and violin playing, which (in my opinion)is very important for his biography. That said, I will try trimming it down.
Yes, he was indeed married to the same woman for all those years, and as far as I can tell their marriage was a very happy and harmonious one. There are some nice vignettes of their life together in his autobiography, maybe I'll try to work in a few mentions of domestic life somewhere.

According to available documents such as the Shahnameh (Book of Kings) by Ferdowsi (Persian Poet) who took on the great role on preserving the Persian language from being lost; by the order of the Arab commander “Yazid ibn al-Muhallab” in north of Persia, Gorgan, many Persians were beheaded so that their blood, mixed with water would energize the millstone to produce as much as one day's meal for him. As Yazid ibn al-Muhallab had vowed and ordered his soldiers to cut off the tongue of anyone who dared to speak Persian. This is why in Arabic, Persians are called “Ajam”, meaning mute. The event of blood mill has been quoted by the generations of historians and Persian (Iranian) """"Zoroastrian"""" families to this day. In recent years however, disenchanted Iranian scholars have been writing about the blood mills and this event has been reported by Iranian historians of the Islamic era. On the way to Mazandaran Province (Northern Iran), Yazid ibn al-Muhallab also ordered 12,000 Persian captives to be hanged at the two sides of the road so that the victorious Arab army could pass through. Upon arrival, many more were massacred in that province and heavy tax (Jizya) was imposed on the survivors who did not convert to Islam.

Some historians have estimated that a total of 400,000 Persian (Iranian) civilians were massacred. After the battle of Ali, the Arab commander (Khalid ibn al-Walid) ordered all the prisoners of war be decapitated so that a creek of blood flows. When the city of “Estakhr” in the south of Iran put up a stiff resistance against the Arab invaders, 50,000 residents were slaughtered. One of the battles by the Arabs has been named, “Jelovla” (Covered), because an estimated 100,000 bodies of the slain Persian soldiers covered the desert.

It is reported that 130,000 Persian women and children were enslaved and sold in the Mecca and Medina markets and large amounts of gold and silver were plundered. One respected Iranian scholar recently wrote, “Why so many had to die or suffer? Because one side was determined to impose his religion upon the other who could not understand”. The Arabs colonized, exploited, raped and despised the Persians (Iranians). They even named the Persian converts “Mawali” or “Liberated Slaves”.

Persian rebellion

Babak Khorramdin was one of the main Iranian (Persian) iconic rebels against the Arab invasion. He alongside his wife (Banu Khorramdin) fought against the Arabs for an estimated time of 23 years and won every battle. Records show that Babak and his army of Khurramites killed over 500,000 invading Arabs.

Caliph Umar, who was behind the conquest of Persia was assassinated in November 644 by a Persian who had been enslaved Pirouz Nahavandi. Piruz was also behind the murder of Ali, however knowledge of Piruz's death is unclear.  Hormuzan is said to have masterminded this plot. Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (644–656) succeeded Umar. During his reign almost the whole of the former Sassanid empire's territory rebelled from time to time until 651, until the last Sassanid emperor Yazdegerd III was assassinated near Merv ending the Sassanid dynasty and Persian (Iranian) resistance to the Muslims. The main rebellion was in the Persian provinces of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Fars Province (Pars), Sistan in 649, Tabaristan, Khorasan (651), and Makran (650).

3 citations have been provided and the funny thing is two of those are famous historian books which

there are TWO wikipedia sites on the SAME TOPIC (special forces).

Both include similar info as the other,  but both  NEED A LOT OF WORK.

this site is the """"most complete/factual"""" of the two (but still with errors):
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_operations_force

this site is amazingly ridiculous in it's lack of complete facts:

(how can you discuss """"special forces"""" and not even include NAVY seals, the most
well known of the groups?)...

Just an FYI -  there are many other sites regarding  CIA and Special forces groups that are not linked, not fully explained, and missing facts.

I am in the military,  I do know what I'm talking about.   Wish I could help more, but this topic's disorganization on your website is far too messy for me to comprehend.

google the CIA website and it's description of special forces  (origins and current branches).    this may help you all

NPOV weights viewpoints in proportion to their prominence. However, when reputable sources contradict one another and are relatively equal in prominence, the core of the NPOV policy is to let competing approaches exist on the same page: work for balance, that is: describe the opposing viewpoints according to reputability of the sources, and give precedence to those sources that are most reliable and verifiable.

0141bcdf68c13b91,"In history there could be a consensus view or a mainstream view, in theology there is no mainstream or consensus view, since most of theology depends upon the church membership of the theologian. Historical scholarship aims at universality and objectivity, while theology makes no such claims. It is true that there are millions who believe that JEDP was birthed in hell (or would believe it if they knew what JEDP means), so in principle their view is notable, but as Enns said, it is a fringe view in the academe, even among scholars who actually disagree with JEDP. The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources, therefore JEDP and its 20-21st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia, while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WP:UNDUE. This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong (Wikipedia has no theology of its own), but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. Of course, this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties, since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers, US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. So, in a sense, scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions. Only fundamentalist seminaries and divinity schools choose to default against historical criticism.

This was a very informative article and it is highly recommended. It needs more information about how to deal with intellectualy dihonesty on Wikipedia. There are some regular writers on Wikipedia who knowingly engage in personal attacks and deletions (even of links) of anyone who explains the connection between Edward Bellamy and his cousin Francis Bellamy (author of the pledge of allegiance) and National Socialism. Some of the worst falsifiers on Wikipedia are Stormie, Lupo, and Matt Crypto. They were challenged to respond to the facts that they suppressed or to concede, and they each conceded that the facts that they suppress are correct and that they delete those facts because they do not want Wikipedia readers to know the truth. They constantly spam their own point of view in their diatribes in which they try to cover up for Nazism. It is behavior that breaks Wikipedia's rules. What kind of people cover-up for Nazis and that horrid ideology?

Many regular writers on Wikipedia are intellectually dishonest  and they regurgitate the top media cover-ups.  They cover up many historic photos of the Pledge of Allegiance http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html that reveal its original straight-arm salute.  They cover up the fact that the author of the Pledge of Allegiance (Francis Bellamy), and his cousin and cohort (Edward Bellamy), were National Socialists and supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party.""""  They cover up the Pledge's straight-arm salute as the origin http://rexcurry.net/pledge1.html of the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). As part of the cover up, they perpetuate the myth http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html that the straight-arm salute was from ancient Rome.  They cover up discoveries by the historian Rex Curry.  The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched outward toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html showing the evolution of the gesture. Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html is an extended military salute. A mnemonic device is the swastika (""""Hakenkreuz"""" in German).   Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist."""" Wikipedia's fibbers cover up for the swastika http://rexcurry.net/swastikanews.html and its use as a sick socialist symbol. Wikipedia's dissemblers cover up for the National Socialist German Worker's Party http://rexcurry.net/swastikamedia.html by overuse of the hackneyed shorthand """"Nazi.""""  Many Wikipedia posters are propagandists in that there was no """"Nazi Party"""" because it was actually the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party"""" and the party members did not call themselves """"Nazis"""" nor the """"Nazi Party.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" developed from slang using the first syllable in the German pronunciation of the """"National Socialist German Workers' Party.""""  In that sense, the author of the Pledge of Allegiance was a """"Nazi"""" too, in that the term means """"National Socialist.""""  The term """"Nazi"""" is also used to hide the National Socialist dogma behind the Pledge of Allegiance, its original gesture, and the National Socialist German Workers' Party.  

Wikipedia's cons use the term """"Nazi"""" and the misnomer """"Nazi Party"""" to cover-up the horrors of socialism. Wikipedia's falsifiers cover up the the socialist trio of atrocities and and their socialist Wholecaust (of which the Holocaust was a part): 62 million people were slaughtered under the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics; 35 million were slaughtered under the Peoples' Republic of China; 21 million were slaughtered under the National Socialist German Workers' Party. They cover up the fact that socialists helped start WWII with the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics together  http://rexcurry.net/socialistwar.html as allies in 1939. They cover up for and are deniers of the socialist Wholecaust, http://rexcurry.net/mediacoverup.html of which the monstrous Holocaust was a part.

Liars on Wikipedia repeat common lies http://rexcurry.net/mediapledge.html of the media. http://rexcurry.net/socialistmedia.html

3. That any defaming or negative remarks regarding Pee Wee Herman or Paul Reubens are removed

4. That any new edits to either Ronald Mcdonald or Paul Reubens are approached with respect (i.e, no bad/negative comments, no defamation, nothing that can be perceived as hurting the reputation of Ronald Mcdonald or Pee Wee Herman

5. That ALL articles regarding Mcdonalds, fast-food, hamburgers, french fries, and good corporate practice carry the """"Mcdonald's arch""""

6. that further more, the """"Paul Reubens"""", """"Pee-Wee Herman"""", """"Tony Curtis"""", """"Maury Povich"""", and """"Construction"""" articles are protected and NEVER updated ever again

I don't buy those arguments.

First, there has also been a recent trend of creating a season article for every Division I program for each of the last 3 or so seasons. I see no reason that that trend won't start to backtrack into earlier teams. Pages getting deleted have less to do with the notion of a single-season article being inherently non-notable, than it has to do with those specific articles not being up to standards. Just look at all the single-season Nebraska football articles that are being created and kept. You say, """"There will never be a separate article for any of these pre-2000 Gators football teams."""" That's a rather bold proclamation to issue on behalf of all editors, present and future. Never say never.

I don't buy that you need to bypass the redirect to take the reader to the applicable section. That's why the season redirects typically redirect to the correct section in the target article. Even better, in case the sections get renamed, only the redirect will need to have its link tweaked, rather than the set of all articles that bypassed the redirect.

Just because there is only one single season article between 1906 and 1999 right now, it does not preclude the distinct possibility of there being more. Especially when many of those 1990's squads finished in the top 10, and the 1995 team actually played in the national championship game - how is that not notable?

Merging the decade articles is a fine consensus. I'm in no way countering that. However, consensus can change over time, and there is no need to prevent other articles from linking to new Florida season articles should that situation ever arise.

I don't know why you bring in broken links, unless you're suggesting that the decade articles would be deleted, and that somehow the bot could figure out to point the link at the season article at that point. Why not keep it simple, and leave the link to the redirect. That way, there is no need for this magic bot. That's one of the main features of redirects: to serve as a placeholder for a possible future article distinct from the redirect target. You call my arguments specious, yet I'm not the one trying to justify departure from accepted Wikipedia guidelines.

True, the answer is obvious. Have the redirect point at the correct section of the decade article. Simple as that. I'll even help update the redirect targets. FaultRyan """,0,0,0,0,0,0

SUPREME COURT, STATE OF COLORADO 

No. 98SA447 

ORIGINAL PROCEEDING IN DISCIPLINE 

January 25, 1999 

IN THE MATTER OF FRED BAUDER 

EN BANC ATTORNEY SUSPENDED 

Linda Donnelly, Attorney Regulation Counsel 

James C. Coyle, Assistant Attorney Regulation Counsel 

Denver, Colorado 

Fred Bauder, Pro Se 

Crestone, Colorado 

PER CURIAM 

In this lawyer discipline case, a hearing panel of the supreme court grievance committee approved the findings and recommendation of the hearing board. The board and the panel recommended that the respondent, Fred Bauder, be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and pay certain costs before again being allowed to practice law. We accept the recommendation. 

I. 

Fred Bauder was licensed to practice law in Colorado in 1976. He failed to answer the formal complaint filed in this case and the hearing board entered a default against him. The allegations of fact contained in the complaint were therefore deemed admitted. See C.R.C.P. 241.13(b); People v. Paulson , 930 P.2d 582, 582 (Colo. 1997). Based on the default and the evidence presented, the hearing board found that the following had been established by clear and convincing evidence. 

On July 14, 1997, we publicly censured Bauder for soliciting for prostitution during a phone call with the wife of a dissolution of marriage client. See People v. Bauder , 941 P.2d 282, 283 (Colo. 1997). Bauder was ordered to pay the costs of that proceeding in the amount of $2,058.97 within thirty days of the date on the opinion. See id. at 283-84. He did not pay the costs as ordered, however, or file a motion for an extension of time to comply with our order. Moreover, Bauder failed to respond to a letter from the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and has not explained or justified his noncompliance with the order. As a result, a request for investigation was filed against him. Bauder did not respond to the request for investigation. 

The hearing board concluded that Bauder knowingly disobeyed an order of this court in violation of Colo. RPC 3.4(c); and that his conduct also violated Colo. RPC 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice) and C.R.C.P. 241.6(7) (failing to cooperate in a disciplinary investigation). 

II. 

The hearing panel approved the board's recommendation that Bauder be suspended for thirty days, be required to petition for reinstatement, and as a further condition of reinstatement, demonstrate that he has paid the costs incurred in the 1997 proceeding. 

Under the ABA Standards for Imposing Lawyer Sanctions (1991 & Supp. 1992) (ABA Standards ), """"[s]uspension is appropriate when a lawyer knowingly violates a court order or rule, and there is injury or potential injury to a client or a party, or interference or potential interference with a legal proceeding."""" ABA Standards 6.22. However, disbarment is warranted when a lawyer """"(a) intentionally or knowingly violates the terms of a prior disciplinary order and such violation causes injury or potential injury to a client, the public, the legal system, or the profession."""" Id. at 8.1(a). 

The 1997 public censure is an aggravating factor for analyzing the proper level of discipline. See id. at 9.22(a). Other aggravating factors include Bauder's refusal to acknowledge the wrongfulness of his conduct, see id. at 9.22(g); his substantial experience in the practice of law, see id. at 9.22(i); and his indifference to making restitution, see id. at 9.22(j). Because Bauder did not appear at the hearing or offer any evidence, no mitigating factors were found. 

The lawyer respondent has defaulted and apparently ignored the disciplinary proceedings. We elect to accept the board's recommendation. See People v. Rishel , 956 P.2d 542, 544 (Colo. 1998). We are satisfied that the requirement that the respondent undergo reinstatement proceedings and demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that he is again fit to practice law will adequately protect the public. Accordingly, we accept the recommendations of the hearing board and panel. One member of the court, however, would impose more severe discipline. 

III. 

It is hereby ordered that Fred Bauder is suspended from the practice of law for",0,0,0,0,0,0

Be careful with that editor

KDesk,
I appreciate your perception that the image of a man smoking a joint (which Mjpresson says exemplifies the title of the article Cannabis smoking) is inappropriate.  You may wish to follow the controversy further on Talk:Cannabis smoking, on the """"discussion"""" page of Wikipedia:WikiProject cannabis, and at Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents/Tokerdesigner banned for one week where User:Tokerdesigner is under consideration for a block because User:Mjpresson proposed the block starting with a false allegation that Tokerdesigner """"threatened"""" Mjpresson.  

At the latter site you may decide to join in and vote to oppose a one-week block against Tokerdesigner especially after going to Mjpresson:Contributions and seeing what that editor has started to do on cannabis-related articles and One-hitter (smoking), seemingly emboldened by the thought that with Tokerdesigner sanctioned, other editors will be intimidated and uneager to try to stop him/her.

My conjecture (which I will be so bold as to share with you here) is that Mj's agenda includes:

The reference is making generic statements, so that it specifies """"light nuclei"""" instead of particular elements.  It does not need to say HOW filled an electron shell is, when making generic remarks about light nuclei.  It DOES specifically state, """"In normal conditions between atoms or molecules, the nuclei never get close enough for fusion to commence"""".  And all of us here know that the conditions of CF are far more normal than stellar.  Regarding the other stuff in my last post, I do know that it is OR and was not trying to get it into the article at this time (it won't be OR forever).  I just wanted to point out to Art, who brags about his Phd, that he's the one who is dead wrong about electron shells being in the way.  I recall reading about the shells being in the way about 4 decades ago, when I first started learning stuff about fusion.  It was the very first thing that came to my mind, as a problem to solve, when I first heard about cold fusion.  It is silly to not mention this problem in the article here.  IS there a conspiracy by CF-detractors, to keep any data out of the article that might someday become related used to the solutions to the main problems?  Why else would Art do his latest lie-of-omission, trying to talk about real nuclei under real-world conditions without paying any attention to the electrons that were associated with those nuclei?  The SUN does not fly apart, all its temperature-freed nuclei receding to infinite distance under the influence of mutual electric repulsion (which would indeed happen if there were no electrons in the mix).  He even wants us to believe that while we can mathematically add 2+2 to get 4 in a Wikipedia article, we can't do simple obvious logic that is mathematically equivalent.  If a source article says, """"termites caused the collapse of this house"""", Wikipedia can't be precisely accurate and say, """"gravity caused the collapse of that house, after termites weakened its structure""""??

 THF 

I have not perused Wikipedia lately, but when I did, I saw some cooler (and sane) heads have seemingly prevailed, including yours.

THF was the first AEI director I had the misfortune to encounter.  When he saw my edits, which he didn't like, he came after me with a vengeance, and lobbied for me to be banned on Wikipedia.  He defamed me on his talk site (yes, I am aware of the meaning of the word, since I also am an attorney).   It was defamation - libel, to be exact -  and removed after a time, when I threatened suit.  I know Wiki doesn't like that - but it reaps what it sows.    THF  threatened me and my husband with frivolous litigation OUTSIDE of Wikipedia, and we called him on it.  We never heard from him again.
At that time, Wiki cliques would not or could not listen to what I had to say, and what had occurred.  I have no idea if I am """"banned"""" or not, and don't care at this point.  After the Kafkaesque experience, I never want to edit again here.  That said, I am grateful that you and it appears some others were able to expose him for what he is - even if it took a different issue entirely.  (I had no particular interest in the Michael Moore debate).

The AEI is one of the most powerful political influences in the Republican party.    THF was quite an eye-opener for me.  Rarely have I ever seen anyone so ruthlessly disparage others, with false """"information"""".  I can only guess what he does """"professionally"""".   THF is a public figure.  His attempt to hide out at Wikipedia claiming it was only a """"hobby"""" was laughable.  It was astonishing that anyone fell for it, but many did.

Good for you for calling him on it.  Maybe there is hope for Wikipedia, but I'm not holding my breath.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

  . I agree with Slrubenstein above. I have long argued that my position, Endler's position (position 1 high up in this discussion page) is a current scientific one and very closely linked with Darwin's.
Excatly, it is A current one. Not THE current one. making that THE definition is WP:NOR.

Kim, I do not see how you can say this unless you agree with Henry Ford that """"history is bunk.""""  Most people are interested in history, and there are even scientists who are interested in the history of their science.  That it confuses you does not mean (as I think is now evident) that it will confuse most readers of this encyclopedia.  They understand that things change.  They also understand that trends have beginnings.  It is simply meaningless to say """"the old definition is incorrect.""""  If you do not understand why, I urge you to read up on the philosophy of science - definitions are more or less useful.  It was that old definition that led to a line of inquiry that has led evolutionary scientists to more precise and more useful understandings of the process.  If anything, as educators we should show readers how scientists start with one formulation of natural selection and then refine it.  
You know, the fact that you reject Darwin's definition of natural selection does not mean natural selection and the theory of evolution are wrong.  On the contrary, it simply means that science has a history, that scientists debate and refine concepts which necessarily change over time.  Do you think this is a trivial point?  In the United States, at least, you are dead wrong.  If you are not from the US let me tell you, there is a huge """"creationist"""" movement which has, on numerous ocassions, had the theory of evolution banned from high schools.  And you should know that one """"argument"""" they make is that Darwin was - well, as you say, """"incorrect.""""  """"See!"""" they exclaim, """"even scientists say Darwin was wrong!  We should no longer teach evolution!""""  Obviously, they misunderstand the way science works.  They do not understand that scientists refine and develop theories without necessarily rejecting them.  I think scientists have an obligation to educate people about this.  Showing how scientists accept an idea, and then change its definition or conceptualization by refining it without repudiating it is the best way to accomplish this.    |  Talk 
You confuse hiding Darwin versus focusses on current usage first and add darwin's definitions in the history section.  
Okay, but with all due respect, you confuse starting with Darwin for focussing on Darwin.  They aren't the same.  There are two reasons for starting with Darwin: one, it is a reasonable starting point, two, whatever differences there are between you, Axel, Marco and others, or among different scientists who have published on natural selection, all can agree that Darwin introduced the idea.  Why not just say @@@Natural selection''', as first introduced by Darwin, refered to ....

 Abolishing the Wikipedia Bans As a Governance Tool 
The following article originally appeared as an add-on comment in the P2P Foundation's blog. Michael Bauwens, the editor of the site, elevated the comment to a main article in its own right.
The governance model of Wikipedia was so anachronistic that it took me over a year to place it in the timeline of historic governance models adopted at various times in the annals of human history.

The thing that stymied me was the prominence of blocking and banning as the primary tool of governance. I simply couldn’t place that among the recognized tools of governance in any historic context.

And then I happened to take a look at the oldest surviving account of secular law — the Code of Hammurabi of 1760 BC.

Of the 282 laws that Hammurabi of Mesopotamia carved into the stone tablets, take note of the very first one:
1. If any one ensnare another, putting a ban upon him, but he can not prove it, then he that ensnared him shall be put to death.
Evidently, banning (ostracism) was a common practice in the tribal cultures in the Middle East some 4000 years ago, at the dawn of civilization. Capricious and spurious banning was evidently such a common and egregious abuse of tribal overlords that Hammurabi made it a capital offense to ban someone without proving just cause.

And yet, on Wikipedia, indefinite blocks and bans without due process are a common occurrence. That is to say, the prevailing governance model of Wikipedia corresponds to a pre-Hammurabic tribal ochlocracy that is so anachronistic, it predates the advent of the Rule of Law.

When Thomas Jefferson and the other Founders drafted the US Constitution, one of the provisions they put in Article One was a prohibition against Bills of Attainder. A Bill of Attainder is the technical term in the law for declaring a person to be an outlaw (without respect to having violated any specific law that applies equally to everyone). The Founders excluded Bills of Attainder from the tools of governance because 4000 years of political history had demonstrated that such a toxic practice is corrosive and ridden with corruption, and invariably sinks any government that comes to rely on it.

The irony here is that Wikipedia purports to be the “sum of all knowledge” with an educational mission that reaches out to students, teachers, and scholars around the world. And yet those exercising power in Wikipedia have not yet learned the oldest and most profound lessons in the annals of human history — lessons enshrined in the first written law and in the first article of the US Constitution.

The consequence of adopting such an anachronistic governance model is that Wikipedians are fated to relive and reify the long-forgotten lessons of history. They relive those lessons by reprising the same kind of political dramas that fill the history books since the dawn of civilization.

The anachronistic governance model which Jimbo Wales foolishly and mindlessly introjected into Wikipedia is simply not a sustainable model in this day and age. Summary and capricious banning wasn’t even a sustainable model some 3768 years ago when Hammurabi first singled it out as an unacceptable practice in a civilized culture.

So what to do about it? The answer can be found in the second law of Hammurabi’s Code. As Hammurabi advises, the solution is to tell them to go jump in the lake.

Or as they say in Yiddish, “Nem zich a vaneh!“

 GISIN page edits 

Thanks for your attention to the GISIN wiki page.  However, RE: your removal of """"note that this should NOT be construed as finalized, and should ONLY be used in the context of working with other GISIN partners in a development context"""": this was added because (at least one of) the GISIN participants were worried that folks might begin attempting to use the (draft) GISIN protocol for development.  In fact, they asked me (yes, I know, it's a wiki, they could have done it themselves...) to change the wording on the page to make SURE no one began investing time in what is now a moving target.  Is it really that bad to have this clarification there?  (""""Draft"""" may mean different things to different people.)  If it makes you feel any better (which I'm guessing it won't, because I know you have a particular reason for your edit), that part won't stay there forever; eventually, the protocol will be released as a """"live"""" (perhaps versioned) product, so this disclaimer will be unnecessary.  However, at this point, I fear that the person who asked me to make the change (who is basically the technical lead on the GISIN project) will become (perhaps justifiably) annoyed if this point is not made clear to his satisfaction.  (He actually requested that the GISIN Wikipedia entry be DELETED if this weren't made clear.)

So... any way you could see fit to re-include that text (or something similar that would serve the same purpose)?

(P.S. - As I think about it, in truth, the onus should really be on the maintainer of the linked sites to ensure that anyone that got to that URL would knowin terms that the site author wants folks to knowthat it """"should NOT be construed as finalized, and should ONLY be used in the context of working with other GISIN partners in a development context"""".... hmmm...

Once that is done, the superfluous material can be weeded out, and perhaps, just perhaps, one ends up with an article about parallel myths, which can then be appropriately retitled so it more accurately represents the topic actually dealt with, which presently is a series of analogous or parallel myths to such myths as virgin birth, son of God, resurrection, miraculous cures, etc.  Note carefully that I'm not making an assertion whether these primarily scriptural stories are accurate or not.

It seems that you  think its okay for Israel to capture and kill members of Hezbollah even though they are civilians but are still a legitimate target but that when Hezbollah captures two Israeli soldiers that they are not a legitimate target.

 From the Members
Welcome to the Ninth issue of the WikiProject Christianity newsletter! Use this newsletter as a mechanism to inform yourselves about progress at the project and please be inspired to take more active roles in what we do.  

I am in the process of going through the various categories related to Christianity. I am finding that several of them may not have sufficient number of members to continue. By the end of the month, I hope to have the main category list finished (yeah, it might take that long, it's huge). At that time, I think we will review all the categories and see which may not have sufficient articles to continue. Please feel free to take part in the discussion regading what the minimum number of category items is, and how to deal with the non-qualifying categories, on the General Forum page.

Cash I am a walmart assocate and I do feel there is a link between Walmart managment and servant leadership, and here is why. The managers are not in charge of the store, the hourly associates are, they take orders directly from the customers. The customers are consitered under walmarts policies to be the boss, the hourly assocates are next in that order and so on. This is a backwards model that was set fourth by Sam Walton himself and is maintained by the current board. Grassroots survays are conducted every 3mos to a year, this survey is a rating of each manager, and is then reviewed by the district and Regional VP, then changes are made. Each level of management must answer to the hourly assocates, and so it is kinda a push/pull managment system. Take my own situation for an example. heres what happend, one night I am short of assocates in the deli(which is where I work) Temp logs did not get done, of course this is a major mistake, I was """"written up"""" for this. However I did not feel this was fair, so I wrote an email to our district manager explaining the situation, he then forwarded the matter to our regional VP. Our VP came to our store, flew in from bentonville mind you. To deal with the situation, he met with me for about an hour and also met with some other deli assocates. After a week he calls me and tells me that he can not get rid of the Written warning, however that all of the managers that had been informed that we where short, would be on probation for the next six months. I was satisfied with the outcome Because, While I was not fault free in the situation, management however was informed that I did not have enough people to help customers and deal with the food safty logs, and they failed to act accordingly and I was not happy with it, so in the end I punished them for their poor perfomance. So you can kinda see why they consiter it a servant leadership. 

Also Cash I hate the way you term 'vast left-wing conspiracy' I am myself a liberal and we liberals are not part of that conspiracy ideal, that would be your union leaders and right-wing large business owners, that are anti-walmart, As much as you would like to identify us liberals with the unions we are in no way assocated with them, infact most of us liberals dislike the unions just as much if not more then you right-wingers. Because the general public tends to identify unions with the democratic party and this is because most union voters, vote on the liberal side, this does not mean that they are liberals, just that they play the politics game. True liberals hate the unions and feel that they are just as bad or worse then a currupt big business. With a currupt big business atleast you know what they are and they make no bones about it, with a union they want to be your friend and then screw you. lol.

On the part about this entry being POV it is very much so POV however I have given up tring to balance it out myself the Anti-Walmart people always revert your edit and then threaten to get you banned for the three revert rule when you attempt to make any edits, its a freaking joke the way they act. However I have just taken on the Idea that they will destroy the entry to the point where people look at it and just shake their heads and how full of BS it is.""",0,0,1,0,0,0

{{unblock|DISCLAIMER: I do not identify as a Nazi, Neo-Nazi, Facist, Neo-Fascist. I do not accept or agree with the actions or views of Hitler or any other dictators in the world for that matter. I do not hate Jews... in fact I have many jewish friends...
Hello, although this is technically an unblock appeal, it is really only a reason to explain.... you won't be in a mood to unblock me when I'm finished talking... )
First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to """"self identify as a nazi""""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, """"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? 
My last comment is in response to Chzz's question about me making the 'gay comment' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn't spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words...
Even if you unblock me (which you won't... )...) I will take a wikibreak... i don't want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life...... i have already recieved a punishment, never becoming an admin (the whole gay... sorry... dumb trust thing)... just know this... i would have enventually removed the swastika after I cooled down and because of your gay... sorry... dumb policy you have lost a serious editor... this whole thing has really annoyed me...

Espionage or a dick spying on some pussy lovers involves an individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as the legitimate holder of the information may change plans or take other countermeasures once it is known that the information is in unauthorized hands. See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection, and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the """"tradecraft"""" used to collect this information.
Hey I gotta joke and it goes like this:Dick says """"Hey Balls get ready for a patry"""" Balls replies """"You fucking liar. Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin.  

History
Incidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http://www.henrywotton.org.uk/

The Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists.

Different intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred  human sources over  research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU
 ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited. 

Various Forms
Unlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information.

The US defines espionage towards itself as """"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web

After Schubert's premature death in 1828 (of typhus as a complication of syphilis), why didn't Hüttenbrenner then make the existence of the manuscript known? Do the torn pages suggest he had somehow damaged the piece and managed to lose, or even inadvertently destroy, the last two movements?[5] Was guilt therefore the reason he kept silent about the work's existence for 37 years after Schubert died?

He stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006

http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l

“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. 

(Example #1 of his lies)

2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.
The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.

“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”

When in reality

“Lofton wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.

(Example #2 of his lies)

I ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!

(Example #3 of his lies)

“In all the WEEKS you've been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, """"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?""""”.

I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!

Here’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!

I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as """"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair"""". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don't appear to establish notability either.

Therefore I am proposing deletion of the article. If the tag is remove, would someone please nominate for deletion? I can't as I can't create the deletion page... 67.67.219.223 (talk)

 Blocking Mardyks 

Excellent work there Shii. We can't have his kind getting us to think about what the Maya actually say about their own prophecies. We insulted him, offended him and abused him and he just had to be ethical and persistant. BLOCK those Mother Fukkers!!! Taking out the entire Santa Fe Public Library system is a great preemptive strike also. There may be others of his kind, that sympathize with those """"Indians"""". These people actually LOVE the Earth and that is without reliable sources! We kicked their asses and have the right to write THEIR history and interpret THEIR sacred teachings however we please. We need more from college students who have been indoctrinated in the Church of Academia. That piece by Stitler is one of the most exaggerated and opinionated and so yeah, use that as the title of the page! And by all means give John MAJOR Jenkins his own section. Not a single scholar or Mayanists agrees with his appropriated theory and this kind of hypocrisy and arrogance is what Wiki is all about. We can get away with it, by continuing to use our power to censor free thinkers like Mardyks and his kind. Sony Pictures is paying us all off with tickets, so let us know how many you want.

HE IS CURRENTLY UNDER INVESTIGATION & SO WORRIED ABOUT IT HE IS CREATING ACCOUNTS ASKING IF HE COULD BE IN TROUBLE. HE IS. THE ONLY REAL GOLDENTONY111/112 ACCOUNTS ARE ON HERE.

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:
1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality).
2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree.
3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs.
4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on.
5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times.
6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to listen to others. It is still possible to get a viewpoint across without resorting to actions a 5 year old would sneer at.

These types are incredibly easy to expose for what they are, they do half the job themselves and not one of them has yet """"defeated"""" me or shut me up.

There is a confusion between the different definitions of heterosexuality.

Likewise, there needs to be a distinction between people with a heterosexual orientation and people who have sexual relationships with people of the opposite gender.  I think if we reorganize the page like the homosexual page this distinction would be more clear.  For example, it would make clear that reproduction results from heterosexual sex, not from a heterosexual orientation.  On the other hand, the causality section is mostly about the development of a heterosexual orientation.  That crucial element isn't clear.

 Mgnbar. What is a stupid act?? 

Hi  consensus means that every body must agree.
I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether you people are doing something terribly wrong and stupid? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text!! 
The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.The answer is Yes!For example, It will be impossible to incorporate pictures in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.But do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including research?

And, according to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my report as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.God luck with deleting all my contributions =) I think you have several hours of work in front of you and still you will do a terrible stupid mistake.

The user's final edit was to blank his Talk page with the edit summary """"fuck it.""""  The page blanking was reverted """"because of an active block"""".  The block is no longer active, the user has not returned to Wikipedia, and I think it is pretty clear that """"fuck it"""" is the equivalent of """"I am retiring from Wikipedia.""""  It seems to me that if someone has expressed quite clearly that they don't want to come back to Wikipedia and that they don't want their sad saga displayed on their Talk page for all eternity, that is within their rights.
Also, I question whether the initial reversion of the page blanking was even according to policy.  Show me one policy that says you cannot blank active block messages on your talk page, hmmm?  While WP:DRC is merely a guideline, there is a distinct lack of Wikipedia policy limiting what kind of content users can remove from their Talk page.  I happen to think there should be policy limiting what a person is allowed to remove from their own talk page (e.g. warnings <24 hours old and active block notices) but as it currently stands there is no such policy, at least not that I can find.  (If I am wrong, please enlighten me!)
If I have to abide by rules I think are dumb, then so does everybody else.  In fact, that is the difference between us and Karaku  Karaku disagreed with the rules so he chose to aggressively break them and call everyone else ignorant.  I disagree with the rules, but I realize they have been formed by community consensus and so I will abide by them as long as they are in place.  And by my interpretation of the current rules, Karaku's blanking of the Talk page should never have been reverted.  
Furthermore, while I recognize that I was using the word """"VANISH"""" imprecisely, it appears to be a longstanding tradition in Wikipedia that if a user wants to just leave and clear out the ugly history of their wrongdoing, they have the right to do that.  Karaku very clearly indicated a desire to do just that (is there really that much difference between putting a banner saying """"Retired"""" at the top of your Talk page vs. blanking the thing with the edit summary """"fuck it""""?).
Anyway, I'm obviously not going to get in an edit war over a retired user's talk page.  I'm just sort of surprised at the insistence to leave all this stuff in place when the user doesn't want it and Wikipedia policy provides no mechanism to override those wishes...   """,0,0,1,0,0,0

2fd54fdafc99da95,"You swine. You vulgar little maggot. You worthless bag of filth. As they say in Texas. I’ll bet you couldn’t pour !@#$ out of a boot with instructions on the heel. You are a canker. A sore that won’t go away. I would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you.
You’re a putrescent mass, a walking vomit. You are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt. You are a jerk, a cad, a weasel. Your life is a monument to stupidity. You are a stench, a revulsion, a big suck on a sour lemon.
You are a bleating foal, a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world. An insensate, blinking calf, meaningful to nobody, abandoned by the puke-drooling, giggling beasts who sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done.
I will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you. You are a monster, an ogre, a malformation. I barf at the very thought of you. You have all the appeal of a paper cut. Lepers avoid you. You are vile, worthless, less than nothing. You are a weed, a fungus, the dregs of this earth. And did I mention you smell?
Try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight. The evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers, but they will be able to access it more rapidly.
You snail-skulled little rabbit. Would that a hawk pick you up, drive its beak into your brain, and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood. May you choke on the queasy, convulsing nausea of your own trite, foolish beliefs.
You are weary, stale, flat and unprofitable. You are grimy, squalid, nasty and profane. You are foul and disgusting. You’re a fool, an ignoramus. Monkeys look down on you. Even sheep won’t have sex with you. You are unreservedly pathetic, starved for attention, and lost in a land that reality forgot.
And what meaning do you expect your delusional self-important statements of unknowing, inexperienced opinion to have with us? What fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tiny-fisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat, spinning rabidly in a circle, waiting for the bite of the snake?
You are a waste of flesh. You have no rhythm. You are ridiculous and obnoxious. You are the moral[size] equivalent of a leech. You are a living emptiness, a meaningless void. You are sour and senile. You are a disease, you puerile one-handed slack-jawed drooling meat slapper.
On a good day you’re a half-wit. You remind me of drool. You are deficient
in all that lends character. You have the personality of wallpaper. You are dank and filthy. You are asinine and benighted. You are the source of all unpleasantness. You spread misery and sorrow wherever you go.
You smarmy lager lout git. You bloody woofter sod. Bugger off, pillock. You grotty wanking oink artless base-court apple-john. You clouted boggish foot-licking twit. You dankish clack-dish plonker. You gormless crook-pated tosser. You churlish boil-brained clotpole ponce. You cockered bum-bailey poofter. You craven dewberry pisshead cockup pratting naff. You gob-kissing gleeking flap-mouthed coxcomb. You dread-bolted
fobbing beef-witted clapper-clawed flirt-gill.
You are a fiend and a coward, and you have bad breath. You are degenerate,
noxious and depraved. I feel debased just for knowing you exist. I despise everything about you, and I wish you would go away.
I cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are. I mean rock-hard stupid.
Dehydrated-rock-hard stupid. Stupid so stupid that it goes way beyond the stupid we know into a whole different dimension of stupid. You are trans-stupid stupid. Meta-stupid. Stupid collapsed on itself so far that even the neutrons have collapsed. Stupid gotten so dense that no intellect can escape. Singularity stupid. Blazing hot mid-day sun on Mercury stupid.
You emit more stupid in one second than our entire galaxy emits in a year. Quasar stupid. Your writing has to be a troll. Nothing in our universe can really be this stupid. Perhaps this is some primordial fragment from the original big bang of stupid. Some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond
the laws of physics that we know. I’m sorry. I can’t go on. This is an epiphany of stupid for me. After this, you may not hear from me again for a while. I don’t have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and half baked comments about unimportant trivia, or any of the rest of this drivel. Duh.

Dennis, why don't you just go back and put that article THE WAY I HAD IT ?! 

1) There *was* an explanation posted along with the change
2) In the United States, if something is not specifically prohibited, then it is LEGAL.

Therefore, Motorcycle Safety Author Pat Hahn is full of shit. Lane splitting is NOT a """"grey area."""" It is LEGAL, as described by the California Department of Motor Vehicles HERE 

http://apps.dmv.ca.gov/pubs/hdbk//shr_slow_veh.htm

""""Motorcycles may travel faster than traffic during congested road conditions and can legally travel in the unused space between two lines of moving or stationary vehicles; this is commonly called """"lane splitting."""" """"

So, how about you just go back and change your sanctimonious little edit back to the truth ? Which is, Motorcycle Safety Author Pat Hoy is about as ignorant on the subject as Joan Claybrooke ? and his stupid, uninformed, retarded remarks have no place in an encyclopedia ?

My assertion was not that """"alot of people read the blog"""" but that it is a relatively popular blog, meaning that it is popular enough to garner articles on the websites of Collegehumor, PCmag, and NPR. I apologize if a simple checking of blog hits is not enough to endow something with the long coveted """"notable"""" status which you so graciously endow. You misquote me further: I did not call Wikipedia a """"clusterfucked internet bureaucracy."""" I was referring to the system which allows certain users to override others simply based on their own personal experience, without any further insight. Listen, I understand that you do have to prevent spam on this website. I know that anyone could come in here and edit the page of a noted dignitary or president to say """"FUCK FUCK BBOOOBIES POOP"""", but my posting was relevant enough to instigate investigation and your deletion of it amounts to an ego trip in that it simply regards the information I posted as irrelevant, despite the fact that my previous posting of it on this website lasted for months before being taken down. I assure you, I am not trying to spam up or fill the already expansive page about Marmaduke with misinformation. I simply want to let people know about a blog I enjoy which is critical of Marmaduke. I am acting in extremely good faith, and have all the freedom to call the levels of bureaucracy on wikipedia a """"clusterfuck"""" and to call your edits an """"ego trip."""" God forbid I should question your authority on the subject. I would appreciate it if you didn't try to condescend me.

As you are aware, anything that i do gets reverted for no reason mainly by you; you use the WP:3RR the WP:SOCK and that stupid conciseness rubbish for your protection when really you know you are just doing it to be difficult and generally annoying. 

As i saw at the top of your page, and i quote from another twit that You are doing nothing to improve the article by constantly reverting - this occuring regularly in the following:

Louise Henriette de Bourbon-Conti - probably the best example of your obsession with having everything that way you want it; 
Henrietta Anne Stuart - i rearranged the page and added the Template:House of Stuart - clearly a tragedy;
Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre‎ - added titles and styles - where are they; i even tried to compromise by removing the stlyes and putting back the titles but once again you must have your way;
Victoire of France‎ - changed the awful layout along with her sister Princess Louise-Marie of France and Princess Marie Adélaïde of France 

Why?

The latter is quite amusing to me proving that you dont even read the article - you simply revert back because I did it - all I did was move the Template:House of Bourbon (France) to a different part of the page! Then you and your chronic arrogance go and revert it under the claim that there are rv excessive, redundant trivia contained in other articles then as always you groan on an on about the usual rubbish with please don't violate WP:3RR or WP:SOCK WHAT IS YOUR POINT ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Shut up!

Where is this claim about the WP:SOCK even from  - another one of your ridiculous  thoughts. I will not back down. 

I have a small bit of advice for you: maybe you should read the WP:OWN article for your own clarification on the matter. You really are a bore; and a selfish one at that.

As someone who has been silently observing your behaviour over the past few months on Wikipedia, I am worried by what I perceive to be a downward spiral of petty fighting, vindictiveness, childishness and bad faith on your part.

Get a life! Find yourself a girl to have sex with or something, because the way you've been sliding downhill is bringing everyone else at this fine institution down.

Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy. 

To be clear, I'm seeing this as idiotically funny and not ranting against admins or Wikipedia.  Anyhow, here's to appreciating the occassional absurdity in life!  19:15""",1,0,0,0,0,0

But you know what the funniest part of all this is? I WIN. I literally have about 17 other accounts that have absolutely nothing to do with """"Vost"""", """"ElliotJoyce"""", or """"Accreditor"""", and I've used those accounts to transform Wikipedia articles to match my tastes, which usually means countering the racist garbage from pseudo-intellectual cancers like you sweety. See, from all of the edits I do, you dumb idiots pick up only a fraction to revert- while I've been keeping you busy with Vost socks (which itself is a sock of another account), I've committed over 200 edits under the radar from special-proxy rotations in the last 4 days. I have 2 admin accounts, 5 non-admin accounts of previously active users which I've since been able to commandeer (more on this later), and about 10 standard self-created accounts. What's even more hilarious is that the reverts engendered by my socks usually cause enough notice to the article that I don't even have to do anything to get my views to dominate: I let other users add fuel to the fire that I started. But you know what the absolute kicker to all of this is? I got you, yes you, you Jew-wannabe, black racist cancer smear, to violate numerous Wikipedia policies and your own Wikipedia philosophy by going after me, vendetta style. I BROKE YOU ON YOUR OWN TERMS. And even after all that, my major points and edits prevailed. I win, and considering that your power level on Wikipedia is considerably more entrenched than my own, my victory is that much more devastating. The IP I'm using at the moment, courtesy of the 24-hour computer lab in my dorm, is about 1 of thousands of batch IPs I have access to, which gives me even greater security and privilege to spread myself over Wikipedia in case my special proxy rotation is ever categorized as a proxy, and thus blocked. Oh, and regarding the commandeering of accounts: graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction (GAPBAD) is a rather effective means to obliterate CAPTCHA; its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly. Guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as Wikipedia undergoes its next server hash? ). You've been warned in advance. Just remember: I win. You can't do anything to me. Go back to being a Jew-wannabe sweety. Jews are white, not black. Remember that too- that's why you're not accepted and never will be accepted by mainstream Judaism or Western society as Jewish. OWNED. How's that taste? L M F A O.""",1,0,0,0,0,0

It turns out that comparing Lonnie to Samson was a compliment and  not an attack on a 'dead gay man' as some gay advocate so dramatically (shocked! haha) suggested. Lonnie was NOT gay. He was a normal man who had been raped as a young boy much like Jerry Sandusky raped those little boys in the Penn State shower. This of course led Lonnie to engage in other gay activities despite his better judgement. The man himself did NOT want to practice homosexuality.

All I wanted was for her to show me where these standards are written, and if not that, where this issue was being discussed if it's such a big problem. Of course she couldn't. Why? Because they don't exist. I called her bluff, she knew it, and then she acted all innocent like I came out of no where to bully her. I got aggressive only after her rude, holier-than-thou tirade started.
