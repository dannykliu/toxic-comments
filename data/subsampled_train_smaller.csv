 Your bold action is ignorant and incorrect. The """"C:"""" isn't just a logogram as you falsely assume and insist it is. Despite your arrogance and condescending tone with me, I'm going to place the proof on this talk page for the article as proof that the proper title of this game is indeed C: The Contra Adventure. For your information, just because an official website does not exist anymore for something, it does not give you the permission or right to change something about it and claim that it is valid. That is not how it works. I'll also post scans of the manual itself that supports what I state (and which applies to the other Contra games in the series whose titles lack colon only in the packaging). First off, here are the official, appropriate sources that list this game as C: The Contra Adventure:

http://ca.ign.com/articles/1998/09/17/c-the-contra-adventure

http://contra.kontek.net/games/games.htm

I would provide Appaloosa's old official website, but it is no longer functional. Same with the early Neo Contra official page.

Many of those links above indicate that the game has only received a North American release. And guess what? The wikipedia article itself even only lists a North American release date; because that is the only region where it has received an official release. Soon, I'm going to scan each page of the game's manual where its proper title is written (ie, every page that has it). Then, it can be agreed upon by any rational person what the real title of the game is; and Verdy P can finally either admit that he's wrong, after so much stubbornness, or continue to show what kind of """"wikipedia volunteer"""" he is.

See these Contra games for the exact same use, or lack thereof, of the colon in the title between the actual name and packaging:

 I disagree that """"[you] set our own social norms by concensus [sic]"""".  ([you], meaning the community, not Heironymous).  I agree that there appears to be such a rule, or your claimed practice, but in my experience 'consensus' is honored far more in the breach than the actual observance.  Indeed, one of my repeated criticisms against Dodo was the fact that he certainly didn't wait for any sort of 'consensus' to develop, and in fact he directly prevented such a consensus simply by reverting in minutes or hours, rather than allowing that consensus to develop.  I think, instead, the 'consensus' claim is primarily used in order to attack, rather then to defend.  In one posting, for example, Dodo actually claimed that I hadn't obtained a 'consensus' that would allow me to make an edit!  (I have never seen any other person make such a weird claim, but on the other hand I haven't seen anybody criticize Dodo for that obvious gaffe.)  I viewed that comment as borderline-nuts, and I have seen no indication that any other poster has taken the reasonable position that: Dodo has, himself, repeatedly violated the rules that WP is claimed to be operating under.  
Do I believe that the average WP user goose-steps?  No, I think it's much more likely (see above)that posters tend to be self-motivated, and 'control-freaks' are powerfully-motivated to maintain an actual practice which is very different than is claimed by 'rule' or ostensible practice.  If I had more time, I'd see if I could see statistics on the persons who have posted here:  How many edits?  How many reverts?  Etc.  I feel certain a pattern is present.

 explanation of removal of material from 熱雞蛋 paragraph 

I removed most of the following added by User:218.254.84.171 on 07:56, 2 July 2006 

In China scrambled eggs are know as """"re ji dan"""" or, 熱雞蛋，and are made in a special way. Firstly, the eggs are scrambled, or beaten, with a whisk or fork to blend the egg white and yolk. Some salt and pepper or other seasoning is usually added and the mixture is then cooked. To make lighter, fluffier scrambled eggs, some milk, cream, soy milk or water is also added.Then, instead of being put of a heat-transferring equipment, it is fried lightly on a pan with seaweed. It is served with rice or dumplings

The reason is easy to see when you compare one of the paragraphs in the beginning describing the cooking of scrambled eggs:

To make scrambled eggs, the eggs are first scrambled, or beaten, with a whisk or fork to blend the egg white and yolk. Some salt and pepper or other seasoning is usually added and the mixture is then cooked. To make lighter, fluffier scrambled eggs, some milk, cream, soy milk or water is also added.  Cheese may also be added when cooking the eggs.  The eggs are finally cooked on a heat-transferring surface, such as in a frying pan coated with melted butter, margarine, or cooking oil...

As you can see, the first three sentences for cooking 熱雞蛋 are just copied from the top (which is especially funny since milk and cream are not widely used in Chinese cooking).  The sentence that is slightly different:

Then, instead of being put of a heat-transferring equipment, it is fried lightly on a pan with seaweed. (熱雞蛋)

Compare with:

The eggs are finally cooked on a heat-transferring surface, such as in a frying pan coated with melted butter, margarine, or cooking oil... (scrambled eggs)

Well, if frying pans are considered heat-transferring, why is not the case for 熱雞蛋?  That just makese no sense.

So the only differentiating factor we're left with is the supposed addition of seaweed.  However I'm strongly disputing this.  While seaweed is used in Chinese cuisine and Chinese cuisine can be quite varied due to the vastness of China and the diaspora of ethnic Chinese all over the world, I have never heard of eggs cooked with seaweed in Chinese cuisine.  No doubt someone out there might cook their eggs with seaweed, but it's definitely not something common in Chinese cuisineyou find me a restaurant that serves the eggs cooked that way!  Indeed even in Japan where seaweed is used more commonly, eggs are still more likely to be cooked without seaweed, and then maybe you sprinkle some seaweed on top for garnish or seasoning after the eggs are finished (or for sushi, you may see the egg omelette tied with seaweed to a block of sushi rice).  So anyway, I'm not believing this unless you can point me to a relevant source.

So when all said and done, we're only left with the Chinese name and that it may be served with rice and dumplings, which is what I left unremoved.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Everything what I read here is unhistorical - to say it gentle...
1. Karl der Große (Charlemagne) wasnt French, he was a Frank: the name France comes from the germanic tribe of the Franken
2. To talk about Germany and France in this time is simply a joke. nationbuilding began more than 200 years later
3. they watched the Romans building a bridge and then they ran away? Dont take it personal, but this article isnt about Britain - witch was invaded as Gallien was. The Romans where overruled by trying to invade """"Germania"""" more than 3 times. The building of the colonies Germania magna and Germania inferior was more to make some good propaganda in Rome, cause the main population was there was Celtic, and the Germanic people there where new settlers looking for new ground. 
4. There is no Germany till 1871. Till that days Germany was splitted into 39 states, before 1815 into the unbelievable amount of more than 200 states. The states where fighting more each other than the foreign states, and so every invasion made by foreign nations was made with the help of some German states against some others.
5. What about the 30 years of war 1518- 1548, where the half of the population died? I know that you are obsessed with WWI and WWII but the history of Germany is mutch longer than that.
6. Austria and Germany where part of the holy roman empire of the German nation, and its unhistorical to devide them from Germany till the year of 1871
7. I know you will hate the idea, but when you take all of this together you have to write 200 German war- historys (Brandenburg, Sachsen, Hessen, Bayern, Schlesien, Hanse- cities...) till 1871, and from that day on you can begin your article

Totally agree with you Direktor, and I am sure that your highly reasonable opinions and facts you are presenting on wikipedia are highly respected and accepted by the waste majority of its readers. Please, if you can, - do your regular check-ups of the articles concerning South Slavic languages and make sure they’re not presenting some misleading information. I would just add to this that although ‘the political reason is the officially maintained distaste of the so-called """"pan-Yugoslav commonness”’, this distaste should be ‘expressed’ in a more civilized manner than creating some non-acceptable partial maps showing only a half of the Shtokavian speaking area, or trying to camouflage the factual state of the close ties within the Central South Slavic system (language) at the templates featured in the articles about South Slavic languages and dialects. And most importantly - that ridiculous ‘pan-Yugo’ distaste which openly sends a message of hatred and separatism, should not, by any mean be reflected in the language area, because it only shows how low and how uncivilized its ‘supporters’ can be, no matter what their ‘not-supported-by anyone-in-scientific-world’ theories they may point out as their sources. 
And, at the end, as an example of a civilized political distaste between nations, here’s the example of Americans and Canadians. Majority of Canadians feel in a different extent, a kind of aversion towards Americans, especially since the start of the ‘George-Bush-era’ in USA. But still, nobody says that Canadians speak a ‘different language’ than Americans, and nobody tries to hide the common history facts and the strong cultural and economical ties that exist between these 2 countries. This is a typical way of overcoming any kind of ‘distaste’ in a human and civilized way, all the other ways are just a shame for humanity.

Hi,

Are you there Sue Anne? This needs your urgent attention.

Apropos my earlier message to you, I removed the pathetic PA from Royboycrashfan 's talk page and warned Crossmr against the PA along with a fair note. Please do read that note.

But he removed my first warning and also reverted back the pathetic PA comment on roy's user page ALONG WITH pathetic PA's AGAIN, in both edit summaries.

I gave him a final warning as he repeatedly violated NPA and would not cease and desist.

Yet he continued with his same unacceptable behaviour.

The edit histories of the talk pages of User_talk:Royboycrashfan and User_talk:Crossmr will make this very clear. He keeps deleting and reverting along with PA's in the edit summary inspite of being EXPLICITLY warned.

This is totally unacceptable. Please do take immediate action.

You know me, atleast a little. There is no way anyone can get away with calling me a vandal. You know I am not here to vandalize, but I have contributed meaningfully to a few articles whatever little time I have been on here.

Of course, there were a few misinformed civil issues along the way (which served to inform me about the policy on civility, NPA etc.), but after the block and blowing off a little steam, my behaviour has been perfectly good as can be expected of any genuine user.

even Vesther for that matter with whom I had a little argument would not call me a vandal.

Also there is another admin Nearly Headless Nick who has appreciated my edits to a certain page. 
Also have made a few edits to other articles the few times i was on.

But surely just because anyone is a very occasional user, that CANNOT be used as an excuse for letting anyone get away with PAs.

Also, NPA specifically states that earlier misinformed mistakes and behaviour CANNOT be used as an EXCUSE for a PA. 
If people kept harping on about old issues, it would become acceptable to attack anyone as everyone makes mistakes in the past.

Crossmr  just CANNOT be allowed to get away with his unacceptable MALICIOUS behaviour.

Please BLOCK him symbolically for whatever time you feel is right, to mainly PREVENT him and later forbid him from:

1. Reverting the pathetic PA on Roy's page along with the pathetic PA edit summaries.

2. Removing my very first warning message with a very civil note. I dont care about the second warning, but the first warning serves as a placeholder for record's sake.

Even after EXPLICIT and SPECIFIC warnings not to continue, he continued with his unacceptable behaviour and BLATANTLY violated NPA that too in edit summaries.
Even after being explicitly advised to assume good faith (AGF), he has failed to do so.

Neither does Mr Baxter being a Catholic.  I doubt he knocked on the doors of catholic homes and goaded them to EFC.  Most people would not have heard of him.  The EFC committee was predominately Liberal and Houlding Tory being councillor.  Many of the EFC committee were in temperance societies, Houlding was a brewer and they viewed he wanted to sell his ales at Anfield - he wanted sole refreshments rights.  Houlding insisted the teams changed at his Sandon pub and walk to the ground.  Holding made money from this in sales. 

The split at EFC creating Liverpool was purely principles.  No religion at all.  Everton wanted a community based club with a spread of shares. Houlding wanted a few rich owners holding most of the shares - the corporate model which is still the same today.  Everton on going to Goodison Park issued 5,000 shares for the fans. EFC were the first to have a shareholders association and the meets are always in the Liverpool Echo.  Everton put the profits back into the club for the benefit of the fans, and by the 1930s had 4 double-decked stands, while Anfield was primitive in comparison because the owners creamed off - despite both clubs having about the same sized fanbase.  Anfield was only uprated in 1963 with the Kemlyn Rd stand, the rest being 1906 at the latest - two years later EFC were hosting a world cup semi-final, the difference was so marked.

Leeds University Study:-

Both of the city’s major clubs share a common origin. An Everton football club was established as a small chapel team in 1878, it became a founder member of the Football League in 1888, first won the championship in 1890-91, and at that time played its home matches at Anfield. By the early 1890s, however, the club was in serious difficulties, experiencing a traumatic internal schism that tore through its management and ownership and led to the creation of a second club.

The club’s main financial backer was Houlding, a prominent brewer and Tory politician but, amidst allegations of financial exploitation, in 1892 the majority of the club’s members abandoned the Anfield site, removed the club from Houlding’s control and set out for Goodison – in retaliation, Houlding incorporated a new club, Liverpool F.C, based at Anfield.

The story of the schism provides an important illustration of how far a successful professional football organization had become integrated into community identity and politics by the late Victorian period. In an early manifestation of today’s frictions between commercial backers and fans, the research shows that the intensity of the wrangling over the governance and ownership of the club bore witness to the importance, even at that early date, of perceptions of the club as a worthy political prize, as a means by which wealthy individuals could gain influence and prestige.

The historical dispute at Everton also emphasises significant contemporary perceptions of the role an iconic football club could play in moulding social behaviour. The owners and directors of the new Everton F.C. believed such an important social institution could be a bastion of ‘purity’, a model of Christian sobriety, of Nonconformist, Liberal ideals. In governance terms they sought to carry over the original ideal of a more democratic ‘members’ club’ into the era of incorporation.

Houlding, too, was well aware of the importance of a successful football club for community identity and involvement, but he believed a corporate structure based on a ‘modern’ business model (wherein investors had control and could expect a reasonable rate of return) was more appropriate. His behaviour at Everton F.C., and his subsequent success in establishing Liverpool F.C., reveal his attempts to weld together politics and sport in such a way as to wield influence in both, to help secure the support base for his brand of ‘Tory Democracy’.

However, the difficulties he encountered at Everton F.C. also show the strength of opposing political perceptions. The alternative Liberal vision of the sober artisan football supporter, closely involved in the affairs of his club through membership and diverse shareholdings, and wary of autocratic manipulations from the drinks trade, proved capable of wrenching Everton F.C. from Houlding’s control even if, after only a short time, he was able to establish a successful rival club.

Another feature of the schism was that it occurred within Protestant ranks for, despite the prominence often assigned to the role of sectarianism in Liverpool politics – and despite the political importance of Irish Home",0,0,0,0,0,0

Reference for Micheli Judgment is secondary source GTrial
28-Apr-2010: This is a reminder that the huge Italian text, used as a reference for the Micheli Judgment, is a secondary source as merely a summary (though huge), at website www.Penale.it, of the Judge Paolo Micheli's court document. Several editors have mistakenly thought it was a primary source, because it is so large and contains many details from the original text. The reference has been listed, in the article, as:

In that gigantic summary document, many sections have been abridged by indicating ellipsis by 2-dot marks """"(..)"""" in many portions of the text. Some of the omitted details are forensic measurements that pinpoint items in a room. The copyright (at bottom) is:

 Harry Potter is a Girl 

Dear Jimbo, I posted something here and it was archived because it was viewed that after a 3 day ban I was too expert in the use of WP:XXXX rules to be a newbie. It was said """"Will be archived: If you ever want to return, Jimbo can discuss this message (and your ADMINISTRATORS comment below) from his talk-page archives."""" I don't even know what that means. Here is my reply to the person that said that. And then the thing that was archived. The longer article was deleted off the page I put it on. I will glance back at my talk page to see if you have anything to say on this matter. If not I understand that it is not your issue. I would though prefer if you looked at it since that was my point, that people in power beneath you seem to want to bite the newbie to the point that the newbie is leaving and not coming back. They even suggested that my issue was with the WP:3RR rule which was not the issue. As a newbie I didn't know about that, and learned my lesson. It was with the time on the talk page being attacked by a WP:GANG / WP:TAGTEAM which are supported by administrators. So the person who archived my comments of your talk page didn't even get the point. Once I was told of the WP:3RR rule I never even touched the article again. Anyway hopefully you will actually read this before someone else finds a WP:XXXX rule as an excuse to delete it. 86.93.139.223  

So you understand, I had 3 days of a block to read the many WP:XXXX that were thrown at me, to then understand them. So while it might be hard for you to believe that someone can read in 3 days a bunch of WP:XXXX rules, it is not impossible. Actually I didn't have to read many, just the ones that were used against me to have me blocked. As I found, they were being totally misquoted against me. So yeah, you might find it hard to believe, you might also want to go to the Alkaline Diet article and look at how many people said exactly the same thing as I did in the past on the article. Is that hard to believe? Don't bother answering, just know that you might want to look at the history and deal with it. I don't understand why this was taken off Jimbo Wales' page by someone other than him with a note hard to believe. Isn't that his choice? Yes I would like him to discuss it with me. As I put it on his page with the express comment that the people (like you) who are in between him and me are the problem. So you making a personal judgement that someone can't read a few Wiki WP:XXXX rules in 3 days gives you the right to ignore my very detailed comments. Sorry but this is exactly the reason I contacted Jimbo and not you. Maximus. 86.93.139.223 (talk)  86.93.139.223  

Dear Jimbo, This is a part of a longer post on the Alkaline Diet page called Harry Potter is a Girl. As I am a newbie I don't know how to do links so copied it here. Sorry for taking your space up on your talk page. Also sorry for WP:TLDR. Please delete this if it is of no interest to you. I can't know what is and what is not of interest to you, and following WP:BOLD I am making my statement and you can decide what to do next. I have put it here as I wanted you to know of my experience here at Wikipedia and how after a few days due to repeated WP:BITE I am leaving Wikipedia editing never to return. Because the people between you and me are the problem I thought to go straight to the top. Sometimes the people at the top don't get told what is going on below them. Anyway thanks for Wikipedia. Good luck and perhaps reduce the number of rules / guidelines as I think they are being manipulated and misused.

This is the intro which was on the Palpatine page for a very long time:

Once an ambitious Senator in the Galactic Senate, the blockade of his homeworld, Naboo, by the Trade Federation, saw him become Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. Palpatine is leader of the Galactic Republic at the time of the Clone Wars, and later is the man who becomes the Emperor. Ultimately, Palpatine is revealed to be the alter ego of Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord of immense power and immeasurable cunning.

yesterday, user Robeykr changed it to this:

Once an ambitious yet unassuming Senator in the Galactic Senate, the blockade of his homeworld, Naboo, by the Trade Federation, saw him become Chancellor of the Galactic Republic shortly before the time of the Clone Wars, and later became absolute leader of the most crushing totalitarian government in the history of the galaxy. Ultimately, it was revealed that Palpatine was the alter ego of Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord of enormous power and considerable cunning.

I changed it back, and tried to clean it up a little:

Once a Senator in the Galactic Senate, the blockade of his homeworld, Naboo, by the Trade Federation, saw him become Chancellor of the Galactic Republic. Palpatine is leader of the Republic during the Clone Wars, and later becomes Galactic Emperor. Ultimately, Palpatine is revealed to be the alter ego of Darth Sidious, a Sith Lord of immense power and immeasurable cunning.

It was on an amendment to the Bill, not the Bill itself (the amendment would have required the prosecution to prove that a statement was intended to incite terrorism, rather than that it might have that effect, in order to secure a conviction). The original result announced was Ayes 299, Noes 300. Had Galloway attended he would have voted Aye and the result would have been declared a tie at 300, but the Speaker would have given his casting vote to the Noes in line with precedent that a tie on an amendment is broken in the direction of the Bill as originally introduced. (It subsequently turned out that the tellers had counted one extra MP as voting Aye and the result was actually 298 to 300, but that is not particularly relevant)

The point for the mention is not that Galloway's absence actually deprived the opposition of the chance to defeat the government, but that following the vote, many people said that it did.

 Note to Administrator Regarding Above Move Request 

To the administrator who will review the above move request.  Note that the names used in these articles were chosen after many months of discussions, discussions that included a wide variety of editors.  The compromise solution was to use Trentino-Alto Adige/Sudtirol, the Province of Trento, and the Province of Bolzano-Bozen.  This was a compromise that kept both the Italian and German usage in the names, and was also the usage in Encyclopedia Britannica (to name just one major English source).  There is slander going on above by Mai-Sachme when he says that individuals engineered this solution, or did it by some form of trickery.  He also went as far as to erase a similar warning to the reviewing administrator.  It is a little shocking, but maybe not surprising, that after a few years a certain editor tries to put things back to how he originally had placed them unilaterally.  Right here what we are seeing is nothing less than than a ambush of this page and I strongly suspect that he has contacted a lot of these editors thru e-mail to ask them to come and support this ambush.   It is no coincidence that within a couple of days all the German-speaking users who happened to be against the compromise solution show up to vote for this.  This is utter abuse of Wikipedia.  So, again, if Wikipedia is at all fair, this move request should be struck down.  It is FACT that in English both the names Alto Adige and South Tyrol, AND Province of Bolzano are in regular use.  Go to any grocery in the United States, and products from this region are advertised as """"wine from Alto Adige"""" or """"speck from Alto Adige"""".  Yet, the same editor who makes this move request (and others who are voting here) has constitently attempted to marginalize the name Alto Adige on this page, or remove its bold typeface next to South Tyrol, or even acknowledge that it is used commonly in English (just review the edits made on these pages over the past year).  What it truly shameful is that this cements the fact that there is no room in these particular people's minds for compromise and to a solution that allowed an Italian/German naming convention.  Wikipedia is NOT a democracy, and this ambush of the page to try to revert the page to a German-centric viewpoint by sending a dozen German-speaking voters here is just wrong.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

0d3e64d71e2f99fe,"Hazel Eyes 

Hi, I noticed you had reverted my changes to the hazel eye section however left me a message informing me I could contact you on your talk page providing more information. I've numerously tried to get Wikipedia to change the hazel eye color section as it's informing people that hazel eyes can be gold/brown and green (either could be dominant) which is a myth as a hazelnut doesn't contain any significant green colouration whatsoever, it is true that sometimes very minimal green tints are present in a brown eye to produce a golden glow and create the hazel colour but hazel eyes can never be eyes that are significantly green with slight brown/gold admixture, that is a North American misconception which is believed to have occurred in the past 100 years or so, as in Europe the origin of light/coloured eyes and hazelnuts, the true/original meaning is still used. The problem is there is no documentation on hazel eye definitions changing throughout the years nor has there ever been a study conducted tracing back to how the myth/misconception in North America came about, it's more of an assumption that people have come to realize as North Americans have started inaccurately identifying eyes that are significantly green with slight brown admixture as well as eyes that are blue or grey with brown admixture; as the colour hazel because they're multi-coloured and appear to change in different lighting even though they don't resemble the colour of a hazelnut in any way. It's an issue/myth that requires common sense to understand really, so even though I cannot provide you with documentation or studies concerning the changes of hazel eye definitions becoming misconceived in North America I can provide you with numerous sources/pictures of what hazel eyes are supposed to be and what the colour 'hazel' is described as being;

http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hazel (defines it as a light golden brown colour, after a hazelnut)

http://www.fanteye.com/extimages/p_FreshlooksColorblendsChartLG.jpg (shows a pure hazel eye, big difference to the green eye diagonally below to the right)

http://ygraph.com/chart/2990 (shows hazel as a honey/beige brown colour and categorizes is next to another brown eye rather than green)

http://www.colormecontacts.com/colored-contacts-for-dark-eyes (puts hazel eyes in the same category as honey, not green plus displays a green eye with abit of brown under the green category)

http://www.yestheyrefake.net/color_contacts_buy_photos.htm (shows hazel eyes in numerous pictures presenting them as a golden brown)

http://hazeleyes-wintergoddess.blogspot.com.au/2009/07/hazel-eyes.html (states the North American misconception and the true/original European definition while showing examples of various sources, numerous pictures and comments below of people agreeing and showing gratitude)

http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_the_definition_of_Hazel_eyes (states the misconception and says that hazel eyes are supposed to match the hazel or cob nut, the fruit of the hazel bush/tree that grows in Europe)

http://m.rateitall.com/iPhone/item.aspx?p=0&ItemID;=1074601 (shows an optometrists opinion/experience with the issue while stating the North American hazel eye misconception and providing sources backing up his statement)

I would also like to state the very first reference to eyes ever being compared to the colour 'hazel' was by William Shakespeare in Romeo & Juliet in which he was comparing a persons eyes to the reddish brown colour of a ripe hazelnut; Mercutio: “Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes;–what eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?” Act 3. Scene I Romeo and Juliet 
Source: http://blog.wordnik.com/shakespeare-soup

Considering William Shakespeare was an English writer it does prove the original intension/purpose of calling a persons eyes the colour hazel was to compare them to the colouration of either a light golden brown hazelnut or a reddish darker brown hazelnut and never a green and gold/brown mix or any multi-coloured eye (blue, grey or green with brown around the pupil) as a hazelnut doesn't present any blue, grey or green colouration nor is the colour 'hazel' described as possessing any of these colours. I only hope you're more understanding of this issue and can agree with what i'm saying, I strongly think you should keep my last changes to the hazel eye section so people can understand/know about what hazel eyes are supposed to be rather than leaving the information as it is feeding people with the North American myth. That being said the hazel eyes picture on the right of the hazel eye section isn't green or gold in any way it's actually a blue eye with significant brown around the pupil, the hazel eye section doesn't say anything about haz",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Selma

 Original founding directors 

You claim: - """"I don't think a school prospectus is a reliable source."""" How so? Surely a school knows who its Board of Directors is?  Not only is it a direct source but by law (in the UK) the information MUST BE CORRECT. To name directors who are not in such a position is a criminal offense under the Company (Disclosures) Act (1985/6 revision and 2002 revision) which also requires the propectus includes the company ID number and the VAT number. As such it is a legal document.

Disclosure of names of directors
8.—(1) Where a company’s business letter includes the name of any director of that company, other than in the text or as a signatory, the letter must disclose the name of every director of that company.
(2) In paragraph (1), “name” has the following meanings—
(a)in the case of a director who is an individual, “name” has the meaning given in section 163(2) of the Act; and
(b)in the case of a director who is a body corporate or a firm that is a legal person under the law by which it is governed, “name” means corporate name or firm name.

Further particulars to appear in business letters, order forms and websites
7.—(1) Every company shall disclose the particulars set out in paragraph (2) on—
(a)its business letters;
(b)its order forms; and
(c)its websites.
(2) The particulars are—
(a)the part of the United Kingdom in which the company is registered;
(b)the company’s registered number;
(c)the address of the company’s registered office;
(d)in the case of a limited company exempt from the obligation to use the word “limited” as part of its registered name under section 30 of the Companies Act 1985(3) or article 40 of the Companies (Northern) Ireland Order 1986(4), the fact that it is a limited company;
(e)in the case of a community interest company which is not a public company, the fact that it is a limited company; and (f)in the case of an investment company within the meaning of section 833 of the Act, the fact that it is such a company.

If so why would this document from 2010, by the Food and Agriculture, rerpresented as the UN official position, considering that in 2011 an official publication from the UN Secretary-General's Panel of Inquiry stated it is legal.UN publication.

364f13cbe17c6a87,"Oh boy, where is Francis? Grandmaster, I can not know any other words than POV pushing to discribe what you are doing. WHERE DID I EVER SAID ANYTHING ABOUT NAKHICHEVAN POPULATION IN 1830s, do you see me ever contesting those statistics? Do you even see me contesting 14th century material? Besides, Nakhichevan discribed there is NOT Nakhichevan with its current bordering. Grandmaster, don't get offended but up to now you have demonstrated that you have no clue of what you are talking about. Taking Nakhichevan as a whole, in its pick, the population jumped to 150,000, it was its most important period, after the 13th century it was replaced, in 14th century, it droped to about half of its prior population, it lost its statue, at 15th century it was taken over by Armenians from the vicinities of Van, and after the desertion of Ani, people moved there. Julfa alone represented a significant portion of the entire population. The closest to the Abbas period you cam is of over 200 years, while I provided data which covered that period. You are the one making up things which you can in no way backup. Here, let readd the materials I have provided.

For the next four centuries, Armenians, who had begun their dispersion after the fall of Ani and the Seljuk Turkish invasions in the eleventh century, continued to emigrate. In the meantime, Persia ( Iran) experienced a revival under the Shi'i Safavids, who became the adversaries of the Sunni Ottomans. From 1501 until 1639, the two fought each other periodically in Armenia. Armenians were uprooted during these wars, and, in 1604, some 250,000 Armenians were forcibly transferred by Shah 'Abbas to Iran. By the seventeenth century, the Armenians had become a minority in parts of their historic lands. The merchants of Julfa in Nakhichevan were among those who were brought to Iran by Shah 'Abbas; he moved them to a suburb of Isfahan where they built the New Julfa community. The support of 'Abbas and subsequent shahs enabled the Armenians to expand Iran's trade with India, China, Russia, and Western Europe. These merchants helped to make the Persian Gulf an important trade center. An Ethnohistorical Dictionary of the Russian and Soviet Empires by James S. Olson, Lee Brigance Pappas, Nicholas C. J. Pappas. p. 44

Shah Abbas devastated his frontier areas, which included parts of Armenia, as a defensive measure and so displaced nearly all the population. [from it] He settled some 13,000 families in the silk-growing northern provinces of Gilan and Mazanderan bordering on the Caspian. (Source: The Armenians and the East India Company in Persia in the Seventeenth and Early Eighteenth Centuries by R. W. Ferrier, The Economic History Review, New Series, Vol. 26, No. 1 (1973), p. 39)

Linda K. Steinmann in her work Shah 'Abbas and the Royal Silk Trade 1599-1629, Vol. 14, No. 1 (1987), pp. 68-74 covers the evacuation of the Armenians, and to a lesser extent elsewhere of Georgians, but nowhere does she say anything about any evacuation of Tartars.

Ina Baghdiantz McCabe covers the evacuation in her work The Shah's Silk for Europe's Silver: The Eurasian Trade of the Julfa Armenians in Safavid Iran and India (1530-1750), I don't see anything about Tartars being evacuated or an undiscriminate evacuation, or any reference of an important Tartar population in Nakhichevan.

Josepho Barbaro while visiting the devastation reports destruction of Armenian towns and its desertion, not Tartars.

Sir William Ouseley during his visit in 1812 has only discribed the destruction of the Armenian city during the evacuation.

In 1603 Shah 'Abbas, the great Safavid ruler of Persia, sent an expedition into Armenia in answer to the appeals of the inhabitants for assistance against the Turks. The death of the Sultan Mahmud III in December 1603 and the succession of his son Ahmed, a boy of twelve, opened the way to an easy conquest in the course of which both retreating Turks and invading Persians plundered the Armenians. The Persian victory was followed by a forced emigration of the population to the Shah's capital of Isfahan. « That dragon of hell, Shah Abbas, nourished from the beginning in the ways of the serpent, saw with an eye of envy the prosperity of the Christians. » So Arakel of Tauriz, the seventeenth-century Armenian historian, puts it, and it was indeed the skill of new... Armenia was left desolates... (A Seventeenth-Century typological cycle of paintings in the Armenian cathedal at Julfa, T. S. R. Boase, Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 13, No. 3/4 pp.323-324)

D.M. Lang writes that one of the two major reasons of the deportation was: ...he desired to make use of the industrial and commercial talents of the Armenians... (Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, Vol. 32, No. 3 (1969) p. 622) Julfa population was so i",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hey Kirill. In the Ryulong case voting page, finding 15 states """"Mythdon has been posting notes at Ryulong's talk page about Ryulong's use of the rollback feature for more than a year"""" which is not evidenced in the evidence in the finding. In fact, another statement in the finding contradicts that by saying """"However, most of Mythdon's posts in early 2009 consisted of warnings in relation to Ryulong's use of the rollback tool"""". I made a similar post on the voting talk page, see here but there was no response. The posts in 2008 were just useless questions, and that the diffs in the finding do not evidence any rollback warning in 2008 nor does it evidence that I was making warnings for over a year.

bf6b8baed82c60cb,"Why do girls lie all the time?! 

Well I can tell you something that bugs me so bad about my sisters and their friends.
They lie about EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING! And they always get away with it.
For example, my sister threw a shoe at me, it slammed into my face and she claimed it hit me in the stomach. How the crap would she know? She wasn't the one that got hit.
Anyways, when they lie they do get away with it. Which is why I'm going to answer this question now. 

Girls lie so they don't have to get in trouble, girls hate getting in trouble and then they rebel when they get grounded and a lot of fighting goes on. Also they'd always rather have their friend or another person in trouble but them. So take this for example, Tashya (made up the name) does something bad. And she knows she'll get in trouble for it. So when her mom or dad finds out she blames it on her brother. And her brother gets yelled at and grounded for her fault. Girls also love it when other people get in trouble.

Thank you for your kind message.  I hope you enjoy making a really positive contribution to Wikipedia.  While I think you're broadly right in the Echo and Enterprise articles that the names should be """"Persian Gulf"""", there are plenty of occasions where this might not be so clear cut.

Context is important, but so is consensus.  I can't recommend any form of edit war, and it's worth bearing in mind that consensus essential.

I think there is possibly scope for a separate article.  For most applications of tensors to engineering (e.g., rigid body dynamics and stress analysis), it is not necessary to accommodate the general coordinate systems of tensor calculus.  Usually there is some fixed background frame and at worst one needs to know how things transform when that frame is rotated.  Then raising and lowering of indices is also not required, and all of the tensoriality is essentially quite trivial (so suitable for engineers).  It seems to me that this is the intended scope of the article, but it might be helpful if it stated this plainly somewhere, although it is possible that I might have misunderstood what is meant by """"rectangular coordinate system"""".

But assuming that the tensoriality of things is supposed to be trivial here, then the article should not dwell too much on this aspect of things (as it presently does).  The likely audience of the article will only get confused by this, and those looking for a more comprehensive treatment of tensors have other articles to select from.  I think some time should be devoted to discussing examples.  A good one is the inertia tensor and Sylvester's law, in my opinion, because it's very easy to visualize (for instance, in terms of a spinning plate or something).    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

And there are in fact multiple books and multiple versions of the bible in Christianity-not as many as Hinduism perhaps, but in the hundreds for sure-all interpreted differently by different sects. This is how there come to be several tens of thousands of sects of Christianity.

 No problems then, and candor I have in spades. People around here from Jimbo on down definitely know when I have a peeve, though these days, seems like most I knew well have quit. Loosing people like CBD, Mel Etitis, and David Kernow I really have to chalk up to the endless strife and hostility of these episodic outbreaks of someone creating a dislocating change... Deletions of something just created, qualify for that, if you'll allow the personal reference. I don't hold grudges, as many can tell you, so I'm taking you at your candorous word too!

 Admittedly, the sweetness and light bit gets cloying all the time, so putting some mustard on things is actually compensation for the the otherwise thankless efforts, now and again. I know that's bent, but self-honesty let that out, so may as well admit it. Shaking preconceptions in those that forget WP:IAR is perhaps the best legacy I sometimes think I can give around here... particularly the young folks don't have enough life experience to know when to live and let live and so ignore a rule or guideline... 

This silly series I'm working is a case in point. Ill served by it when I checked our coverage when I stumbled across it in November, I'm compulsed as I have been in many areas here to try improving it, mainly by adding to it, for it was cut by a harsh, ill-judged ruthless person. The original writers went on to other tasks in life's stages, so a nicely put together set of articles covering the series got run over by the mac truck of one guy, aided passively by 2-3 others, pushing the new notability rules so they wiped out hundreds of man-hours of work, in some nifty and salvageable articles. Turned them into around 180 redirects and put together a paltry in-universe list article that had almost zero value... leaving things well enough alone would have been far better. Kidz!!! Sigh.

 Request that """"Civilians..."""" section be cleaned up 

I am unable to edit right now, so I would like to draw a more senior user's attention on this matter:

This paragraph needs to be changed to use less inflammatory wording:

Strikes on Lebanon's civilian population and infrastructure include Beirut airport, residential buildings,[67] clearly marked ambulances,[68] fleeing civilians prominently waving white flags,[69] United Nations posts and personnel,[70] ports, a lighthouse, grain silos, bridges, roads, factories, medical and relief trucks,[71] mobile telephone and television stations, fuel containers and service stations, and the country's largest dairy farm Liban Lait.

""""clearly marked ambulances"""" and """"fleeing civilians prominently waving white flags"""" is ridiculous wording, clearly showing an Anti-Israel bias.

It is fine to say that there have been confirmed instances of ambulances and fleeing civilians being hit, but to use language like """"clearly marked"""" and """"prominently waving white flags"""" is completely unacceptable and should be removed.

Also, I will request again that some mention be made of Hezbollah's use of warheads filled with ball bearings (whihc are designed to maximize human casualties).  All mention of this was removed, apparently by POV vandals.

The part about the ball bearings was moved down and is now next to the part about Hezbollah using civilians as human shields, I believe.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Your Signature

The following is a passage from Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages

=== Images ===

Images of any kind should not be used in signatures.

Many concerns have been raised over the use of images in signatures, and they are considered to serve no use to the encyclopedia project.  Images in signatures should not be used for several reasons:

 they are an unnecessary drain on server resources, and could cause server slowdown
 a new image can be uploaded in place of the one you chose, making your signature a target for possible vandalism and Denial-of-service attacks
 they reduce searchability, making pages more difficult to read
 they make it more difficult to copy text from a page
 they are potentially distracting from the actual message
 in most browsers images do not scale with the text, making lines with images higher than those without
 they clutter up the """"file links"""" list on the image page every time you sign on a different talk page
 images in signatures give undue prominence to a given user's contribution

3789083d78cb67b8,"Glosbe does translate ezman as “heaven” (******) or “sky” (*****) and it back-translates “heaven” as ezman.

 Some definitions from Merriam-Webster Unabridged:

 Heaven. 1. a. … especially, the expanse [of space] that seems to be over the earth like a great … dome — usually used in plural. 2. a. … the place … of the blessed dead.
 Earth. 1. a.  … soil, ground. 2. the sphere of mortal life comprising the world with its lands and seas as distinguished from spheres of spirit life — compare heaven, hell.
 Sky. 1. b. the expanse [of space] appearing as a great vault … over the earth. 2. heaven (def. 2) — often used in plural.
 Tremble. 1. to shake involuntarily (as with fear, cold, excitement, fatigue).

 These two expressions are good idiomatic English:
 “If his wrath is aroused, the skies will tremble [in fear].”
 “If his wrath is aroused, the heavens will tremble [in fear].”
 Here the singular “sky” and “heaven” would not be used in good spoken English, only in mediocre written English.

 So we have a choice of eight ‘very good’ literal translations:

 “YPG is [goes] walking, and the earth and [the] heavens tremble.”

 If you try speaking them aloud, you may find that this one sounds best:
 A. “YPG goes walking, and the earth and heavens tremble.” Something about the meter (the cadence) just makes it sound liks a military motto.

 The present-progressive clause “YPG is walking” would naturally correlate with the present-progressive clause “the earth and skies are trembling.” But we want to use simple present tense in the second clause.  (See above.)

 To do so, a native English speaker would begin with “YPG goes walking …”, because it combines both tenses: simple present and present progressive.

 But see whether you can come up with a better-sounding combination!",0,0,0,0,0,0

""""This raises concerns over the connection between rapid global temperature changes and the possibility of population extinction."""" I'm waiting for V. to format the reference from this source: Proc. Nati. Acad. Sci. USA Vol. 91, pp. 7487-7490, August 1994 Population Biology Climate change and temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles (eticon/population demography/rate of evolutin/sex ratio/turtles)FREDRIC J. JANZEN* Department of Ecology and Evolution, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 Communicated by Gordon H. Orians, April 29, 1994 (received for review January 3, 1994) [].

I suggest the connection between the concern over global warming and extinction be returned to article based on this passage:

The causal influence of annual variation in climatic temperature on cohort sex ratios in this population of painted turtles serves as a clear empirical example of the biological impact portended by rapid global temperature change. This study demonstrates that the demography of populations of species with temperature-dependent sex determination may be directly sensitive even to modest deviations in the local thermal environment. These results are entirely consistent with earlier work on a nesting beach of endangered loggerhead sea turtles (Caretta caretta), wherein 87-99% of hatchlings from the rookery in each of 3 years were females because sand temperatures at nest level were high (39). If such strongly female-biased cohorts lead to highly skewed adult sex ratios, then the probability of population extinction may be greatly enhanced.

oldwindybear was using an article plagiarizing major portions from me to serve as verification of his historical credentials, so that he could insert POV into something else written by me — the same guy he's written of above, """"...frankly, your moronic language lends no credance to anything you say regarding this or any other historical subject.""""

if that's the case, he'd better get busy deleting """"his"""" article! ROFL

please
i haven't the heart to participate in this article anymore, but would somebody please revert the POV at least oldwindybear inserted? i put in my time. surely there's a knowledgeable B&C; freak out there who can at least stand guard for a while, if not improve the article from even its pre-vandalism state.  

note to oldwindybear
before you insert your allegations once again (hopefully somewhere that doesn't break up my signed comment), you may want to consider some immutable truths which i hoped you would have noticed before launching the terribly wrong rant i just removed from within my signed comments. (unlike you, i do not want somebody else's words attributed to me):

the version i quoted above as """"wikipedia"""" in the comparison is entirely from 12:03, 20 June 2005 UTC.
you claim to have contributed to the article as  and .
the first edit by  in the article was 20:21, 5 September 2005 UTC.
the first edit by  in the article was 20:06, 4 September 2005 UTC.
therefore, you did not write a single word of the article version in the comparison above.

please take a moment to let that sink in: you did not write a single word of the article version in the comparison above.

you also misapprehend the definition of plagiarism. it has nothing to do with copyright. you used entire blocks of words of other authors (primarily me), and credited yourself as the author. that is plagiarism.

though my initial contributions to the article are readily viewable in the history (and later as another user and several IPs), i want to steer away from the """"i wrote x amount"""" aspect, because the article was and is a collaborative effort. the troubling part, not only for me, but also for the owner of the site to which you submitted """"your"""" article, is that you used whole blocks from a wikipedia article to which you contributed not a single word, and not only put your name to it, but did not even cite wikipedia as a source.

contrary to the fraudulent hiding of your sources while merely peppering whole blocks of material you stole, i did write the actual unquoted prose in my contributions myself, while citing clearly all of my sources. despite your assertion, the version you stole from stated explicitly, """"Known primarily for robbing banks, he preferred smaller jobs, robbing grocery stores and filling stations at a rate far outpacing the ten to fifteen bank robberies attributed to him and the Barrow gang."""" as with everything else in the wikipedia side of the comparison, none of that is your writing. neither, as has been raised and explained several times already, were you the first in this article to raise the issue of legality with regard to the killing of bonnie parker. this has all been explained. please do not bully other users into holding your hand. take a moment. review the article history. review the discussion. slow down and pay attention.

in short, there isn't a leg to stand on if attempting to rebut my charge of plagiarism. you did not arrive on the scene until over 2 months had passed from when the version in the comparison was written. i'll say again: you did not contribute a single syllable to it. yet you lifted whole sections from it, changing very little — in some cases none — and put your name to it. that, sir, is the very definition of plagiarism, and it doesn't matter whether i or any other editor wrote the source material you took; you wrote none of it. the partial copying at the beginning (which you picked out to rebut) was what i already labeled as only """"minor lifting"""". be honest. it gets far worse. it gets embarrassingly worse. please don't try to fabricate stories which anybody poring through the history can instantly recognize as vapor. the sad part is that the entire facade of """"your article"""" was as an excuse for you to insert even more POV into articles. if you don't understand WP:NPOV, WP:NOR, WP:V, etc. after so many people have tried explaining them to you, perhaps wikipedia isn't the plac",0,0,0,0,0,0

Elelland

Hello Humus

I am sorry if I have placed this note in the wrong spot. I m very inexperienced with Wikipedia. I was enthralled by Wikipedia. Initially. That is until I met Eleland. I noticed that you had some interesting discussions with Eleland. Eleland engineered a small article which I contributed some information to be deleted. He organised a """"kangaroo court"""" made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.

The Article was on Ed O'Loughlin Fairfax publishing MidEast correspondent. The said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. He was amongst the candidates for this year's HR.com dishonest reporter award - despite being in the Australia only catchment area - so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.

Anyway Eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.

So I studied Eleland a little.

I've looked at over 100 of his posts on the Arab Israel conflict. More than 95 were directly anti-Israel. His modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro-Israel side. In this way he has undermined many many articles.

Personally I don't care what his opinion is, but when he uses his editorial power and influence at Wikipedia to falsely invalidate, delete, manipulate etc. I think there is a problem.

Wikipedia is, I am afraid, beginning to read like Eleland wrote the script.

Who is Eleland? What power does he actually have?

Can anything be done?

ff7f3e14fe0ae328,"Misrepresenting administrator scope 

Please take care not to misrepresent how administrators are expected to act, or any other policy in the future - administrators do not make content decisions. What you quoted was particular only to discretionary sanctions which are only applicable in certain arbitration cases. You view has therefore been moved again to the talk page.   

Please take care not to engage in misrepresentation - you are not outside of this dispute, and your quote was particular to discretionary sanctions. Administrators do not make content decisions. See below. Please also do not change my view - I suggest you revert your latest edit - failure to do so will result in administrator intervention for deliberate misrepresentation, misuse of the dispute resolution process and vandalism.   
 

You are welcome to your view, but you are not welcome to misrepresent administrator policy or to change my view.   

You have engaged in misrepresentation, perhaps out of misunderstanding. Administrators are only allowed to make discretionary sanctions in arbitration cases where they are explicitly allowed to - Kirill's comment was in relation to discretionary sanctions only (check the context of his comment; the heading under which he made it). FloNight's comment is in relation to administrator enforcement in general, which is why the SAB remedy has been proposed in the homeopathy case.   

It is only disruptive where there is edit-warring - that is, edit-warring against consensus (separate policy on conduct). NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. Would you like arbitrator clarification?   

Did you read what I said above? NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority. See also: . 
Discussing content issues at a conduct Rfc is inappropriate - we have a clear distinction between Article Rfc and Rfc on user conduct for that reason. What is acceptable is pointing editors to an Article RFC so editors can comment on content (and hence address content issues), and that is where discussion of those issues belong in the dispute resolution process.   

So please modify your view so that there is no misrepresentation of policy/norms as it has been sanctioned by the Committee in the past (and admins have been sanctioned when using their position to make a ruling on content). Article RFC is where comment is made on the content policies you have quoted - you are welcome to direct a link to the discussion there in your view so that it is dealt with.   

It seems you don't get the point - it's ok if you think it should be enforceable, but it is completely irresponsible to misrepresent policy by saying that it must be enforcible when it is forbidden, and engaging in misrepresentation in using an arbitrator's view on a separate matter to be absolute on all matters. It contributes to the confusion editors have about Wikipedia norms and policies, and it is unacceptable. Therefore, I am referring it directly to the Committee.   

The assumption of bad faith is on your part, for you clearly have not read - NO administrator has made blocks for violations of WP:NPOV, WP:V, and WP:NOR because they can be desysopped for making a rulings on content - for which they do not have the authority.

I won't get into the existence of a Criticism section, its been discussed before, and if its consensus to keep it, I'm all for it. But it does seem to be piling it on when the Bronson Arroyo glove slapping incident is mentioned in two separate sections. It appears under criticisms and under the 2004 section when it happened. Under the criticism section its even referred to as """"blatant."""" And while I think it actually was pretty blatant, it seems like POV to use such a strong word.

The Bambino also hit 114 in 1926-27 (60 and 54).
It says right-handed in the article, the Bambino was left-handed.  

Clean-up
Regarding Greiner's reverts, 1) it was proper to include the second comma in a series, for example A, B, and C, and his revision is therefore inappropriate; 2) it is proper to have the year series read 1988-90, as I had it, and therefore his revision is not appropriate, and 3) while it is the general rule to write out numbers one through nine, here  in baseball articles, and in articles that also have the same numbers in a series represented by numberals, as in hit """"9 home runs and ten home runs in consecutive years,"""" it is acceptable to have numbers 1-9 written out.  It especially aids the reader in articles such as this one, which are replete with numbers, in that numerals are easier to scan.

http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&state;=36qnco.3.1 Curse of the A-Rod was a registered trademark of a company in Boston, Massachusetts, but beyond that, no trademark exists for A-Rod.

But the FBI record, told in reports and Warren Commission Exhibits and documents, tell a different story, one in which the witnesses never saw anything.

FGR#11 is interesting and gives some insight into how this bureaucratic world functions. A couple of things I noted. The table of p28 shows a good dozen elements (including Ca) where the values changes by well over and order of magnitude from on """"model"""" to the next. The following summary on p29  says: """"for about 70% of radionuclides, the differences are not substantial, ie., less than a factor of four. 

That points out that none of these figures are derived from actual physical measurements but from computer models. Also there is no qualification on the uncertainty of these values as one would expect if it was a scientific test (which it is not , it's a model) . The magnitude of the changes and that fact that a factor of 4 is seen as """"not substantial"""" gives an idea of how reliable the number may or may not be.

Disclaimer:

Neither Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the University of California,
nor the Department of Energy recommends eating bananas.

So it seems the advocates of this BED idea do regard it as a bit of an insider joke, and take joy in using it to be provocative. 

But if the K-40 in a banana is 400 times more potent than that already in muscle tissue there is still a """"substantial"""" problem somewhere.

Just a note of the corrections I made to the character section:

Under Full Moon, I added that in the final episode, she sings 'Love Chronicle' which was the third ending theme and the closing song of Full Moon's last concert.

Under Fuzuki, it said 'fiancee' which not only lacks the accent, but a double e is the feminine.

For Wakaouji, I explained when Takuto explained just after when Izumi tries to trick Mitsuki into jumping, he tells the doctor that he remembers the past and he was Route L's singer, and the agreement they made.

Under Madoka, it doesn't matter if two people audition with the same song. Eternal Song was planned as Madoka's debut single. Madoka's plan was that this way Full Moon wouldn't be able to sing the song at the same time, especially since they originally had the same producer. Since Mitsuki had her heart set on the song, she and Ooshige tried to get another producer. Eventually, under certain conditions, Wakaouji agrees to the job.

Also, in the anime, in one episode showing herself as a young child actress, she is shown to go through a lot before the anime began. Full Moon, on the other hand, rose to stardom with relatively little effort.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Plot summary - I'm not sure if you cited this as a problem, but think that the 'plot section' has a reasonable amount of information (and plot points throughout the development and writing section) because both cast and crew released this information to the public domain, via interviews, statements - etc, so I think that it should be mention, because if the information wasn't suppose to be known then they wouldn't have stated it.

 I do not find it trivial at all. I take offense when a great person is commonly known by a bad name. It is, without a doubt, a name with violates NPOV and is common. Ivan the Terrible is the common name for Ivan IV of Russia, but the wiki article is Ivan IV. No one is going to try to tell me that Ivan the Terrible isn't the more well known name. You are being insulting by calling it a """"supposed"""" POV issue, since it certainly does respect POV with respect to the person himself, and to non-Christians over the world (which are the majority, even if not the majority of English speakers). I can not demonstrate that another name is more common. What is the common name for homosexuals in America today? I won't sully this thread by mentioning it, by you can bet your bottom dollar (ooh, bad pun) that the wikipedia article isn't named that. Sometimes ?maybe even most of the time? common wisdom is wrong. Julian is not an apostate, he is a leader, both the Constantine before and the Constantius after were psychotics by comparison.

Biography

Offenbach's father, Isaac Juda Eberst, born 26 October 1779 in Offenbach am Main, took the name Offenbach in 1808 when he was already in Deutz where he had moved in 1802.Yon, Jean-Claude. Jacques Offenbach. Editions Gallimard, Paris, 2000.

The alternative would appear to be a long explanation of the Napoleonic edict.

  
Thank you, that sounds good, although I would prefer a link to an explanatory article or some footnote, but maybe that's just me. One more thing: the italics around his father's name and the bolding of Offenbach ought to be dropped.    

 Play titles 
Confusingly, in 'other stage works', three of the play titles with a Wikipedia link are no longer spelled the same (case) as given in the articles about the plays...   
Can you clarify? There are no red links in that section. zach 
There aren't any red links because the three plays in question are piped links to their English titles. Cg2p0B0u8m's observation that the French titles in these articles uses different capitalisation is correct. We know that the most widely used style of French title capitalisation, which is a bit idosyncratic and not cosnsistently applied in French writing, is not used in the opera or classical music projects on Wikipedia where a strict but easily understood system is used. Other projects are not so strict; that's why those articles on the plays use a different spelling.    
Ah. Missed that. Shouldn't we be using the English titles? After all The Tales of Hoffmann appears just below. zach 
Wouldn't that make for an awkward list as we don't have English titles for all these plays?    
Perhaps, but then what is the least bad solution? My primary editing instinct tells me that consistency should come first — at least within the article. zach 
But at the cost of consistency within the paragraph. — (shrug) Whatever, no biggie. The list itself is a useful improvement to the article, in whichever language the titles are listed.    

Yes, it's not a major thing. From Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(France_%26_French-related)#Works_of_art it seemed that only classical music and opera had opted out of l’Académie française / into 'Grove'; no problem.    
Also visual arts, but as we have often remarked, this is a classic 'no-win' situation. zach """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello, Xeltifon. Someone963852 is simply going by our rules on this. There won't be enough work that you can do to make it acceptable to mention in the lead that zoophilia is a sexual orientation. It has been made extensively clear on this talk page and elsewhere that it is a fringe assertion to call it a sexual orientation, per WP:FRINGE. The Wikipedia:Fringe theories/Noticeboard would also make this clear if this matter were taken there. Zoophilia either shouldn't be called a sexual orientation in this article at all or can only be called one with WP:DUE WEIGHT; it is already mentioned with due weight lower in this article. You saw where it is mentioned lower, as you added it in. However, such a sexual orientation mention was included lower in the article before at some point (different points in time).
 
And with regard to what you stated in this edit summary about the lead, that is not exactly what WP:LEAD says. Citations may or may not be allowed in the lead, but are usually advised to be in the lead for controversial topics. Zoophilia is clearly a controversial topic.

And regarding bolding the terms, alternative terms should be bolded in the lead. Sometimes, they are also bolded lower in the article at first mention. See WP:BOLDTITLE. I would object to your removal of the alternative terms from the lead, per WP:Alternative titles, but, also per WP:Alternative titles, """"If there are at least three alternative names, or there is something notable about the names themselves, a separate name section is recommended."""" And, as you know, there is a section in this article to discuss these terms. Still, it is sometimes best to mention the alternative titles in the lead as well, especially if one or more of them is very well known as an alternative title.

This is the text i struggle to post in G.91 page. Just to realize how i want to contribute to wiki, and how someone don't want i do it:

The Aeritalia G.91, also known as the Fiat G.91 and nicknamed Gina, was an light Italian fighter aircraft that was intended to serve as standard equipment for NATO air forces in the 1960s. It was eventually only adopted by three - the Italian Air Force, West Germany's Luftwaffe, and the Portuguese Air Force, but enjoyed a long service life that extended over 35 years.

Development
In 1953, European aircraft manufacturers were invited by NATO to submit aircraft for evaluation for the Light Weight Strike Fighter (LWSF) role. The G.91 was designed to the specification by the famous Italian engineer Giuseppe Gabrielli, hence the """"G"""" designation. The competition was intended to produce an aircraft that was light, small, expendable, equipped with basic weapons and avionics and capable of operating with minimal ground support. These specifications were developed for two reasons: the first was the nuclear threat and the other was to counter the trend towards larger and more expensive aircraft.

The technical requirements were: 
 1,100 m take-off distance over a 15 m obstacle
 Capability to operate from grass strips and streets
 Max speed of 0.95 Mach
 Range of 280 km with 10 min over the target
 Armoured protection for the pilot and the fuel tanks
 4x12.7 mm or 2x20 mm or 30 mm guns
 A maximum of 2,200 kg empty weight and 4,700 kg max weightFerrari 1992, p. 83.

The challengher proposals must had been presented within two months after the request.
The projecting work was only apparently an easy task, because making a very small aircraft yet capable to cover these NATO specifications was difficult. 

Fiat Aviazione presented G.91 and so did other competitors with a total of 10 projects, analysed since 18 March by AGARD (Advisory Group for Aeronautical Research and Development), led by Theodore Von Karman. The finalists were declared Breguet Taon, Dassault Etendard, Fiat G.91 and Folland Gnat. Another interesting project was Sud Aviation Badoleur, that solved drastically the problem of a proper landing undercarriage, simply omitted and sobstitued with a landing and take off skid (aircraft was moved in ground operations with a special trailer). This, however, was not ufficially presented to AGARD, that choose, on paper, the Taon as winner.

In the meanwhile, there was the problem of the engine, that must been light yet enough powerful and reliable, with easy and cheap maintenance, like the whole aircraft. The solution was realized by Bristol with the Bristol Orpheus, a simple and effective turbojet. It was adopted to all the finalists, so Bristol will won the contest in every case. G.91R, presented by Fiat, was also called 'little Sabre'. It was due by the knowledge gained with license-production of a modern aircraft, the F-86K, that helped to make much experience with advanced jet aircrafts, . It was similar to F-86 as overall design, but smaller and capable to operate from semi-prepared airstrips.

G.91R was 20% heavier than the estimates and this was due partly to testing hardware, but it was powered by a Bristol Orpheus B.Or 801, 1,800 kg/t. 
It was yet capable to supersonic speed in dives, as shown by the flight made in 20 February 1957 when it was able to break the sound barrier four times with 9,000 m dives. His test pilot Riccardo Bignamini, a famous one of that times (he won McKenna Trophy at Empire Test School) was a key element to solve the G.91 shortcomings and the first flight was made in 9 August 1956 at Torino-Caselle airfield. 

Few days after it was tested at high speed and at 1,300 m ceiling, but lost control and Bignamini w",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Wikilings exposed at http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html  

I had an email exchange with Matt Crypto (the, er, self-proclaimed """"Nobody"""" who admits he knows nothing about the topic being discussed -though he improperly deletes it http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html ), asking him to stop spamming his childish comments and spamming his deletions of my Wikipedia posts and to stop emailing me. (He seems to think that Wikipedia is his whole world and is the entire internet, and it is not. Nice. http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html ) Anyway, Matt's only response was to make off-topic childish remarks and  here's the genius part  when Matt's own childish remarks (similar to Matt's reply above) are repeated back to Matt in an effort to show Matt his childishness (and to mock Matt) Matt becomes mad and remains clueless.  I suppose Matt thinks that when he does this, he's done something very clever. Sadly, Matt's debating style is much favoured by schoolchildren: make off-topic childish remarks and stalk accurate writers with his """"nah-nee-nah"""" voice. It is amusing, though, to see Matt (a grown-up?) do it.  Here are the points that Matt never addresses, does not dispute, but always tries to delete so that other wikipedians will not know: 

 1. Dr. Rex Curry showed that the USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the """"ancient Roman salute"""" is a myth. http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html  

2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html

3. Francis Bellamy (author of the """"Pledge of Allegiance"""") and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel """"Looking Backward"""") and Charles Bellamy (author of """"A Moment of Madness"""") were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement in the USA, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" and their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party"""" (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute.  """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html

Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas rely on a false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not use the word """"swastika,"""" but called their symbol a """"Hakenkreuz.""""

 I encourage you to read that essay carefully. WP is a great resource. It is an amazing resource. It is additionally useful, helpful, unprecedented, and perhaps even world changing! I love it, that's why I volunteer my time here to improve articles and direct people to resources that can help answer their questions. But none of that makes it reliable, not in WP's own terminology. The scientific theory article is a great example. That's actually a pretty good article. And it's useful for many purposes. But the definition is presented too simplistically, and it makes it seem that all theories are generally accepted as true explanations of the world, and that is not the case, as is demonstrated by the phlogiston theory. And that example is confusing, but there are also many many inaccuracies and outright incorrect statements on WP  I know because I've fixed a few. Some are accidental, some are malicious, some will be soon fixed, but others linger. Another thing to remember is WP is always a work in progress. A true scholar should evaluate the reliability of every source. That is why I keep directing you to the SEP. That article is written by highly esteemed professional philosophers of science, who we know are educated, trained, credentialed and accepted in that community. Likewise, textbooks are vetted by editors and publishers, and academic journal articles go through peer review to help ensure that correct information is presented. That is part of why they are WP:RS. In contrast, WP is the encyclopedia anyone can edit. I can assert to you that I'm a professional scientist, with over a hundred citations in peer-reviewed journals to my academic articles, and a PhD in math, and maybe that will help convince you that I know what I'm talking about. But I'm not going to bother to prove that to you, and you can't really be sure that I'm not making that stuff up ) While we attempt to distill our reliable sources into good articles, sometimes that gets messed up. If you read the entirety of the SEP article on scientific theory, you will see that it does not support the sentence which cites it in our article! I don't know how that happened. But it will just sit there wrong until someone notices and has the time and energy to fix it. And even then, some well-intentioned editors may resist the change, and revert. And maybe it's not even wrong. Maybe some RS do reserve """"theory"""" for widely accepted theories, and would instead say that we should rename the Phlogiston theory to """"the former Phlogiston theory"""" or something else! So then we'd have to do a whole re-write, explaining several different notions of what a scientific theory is, and then it might make the article less useful for the casual reader. 
For 99% of lay use, the issue of reliability may not matter. And surely using WP's sources to cite in papers is a great idea - but you have to make sure that you read and understand them yourself, and don't depend on what WP says they say. If my life depended on it, I would not trust anything on WP, unless somehow I had no other sources available at all, and hence no choice. So no, WP is not reliable. But that doesn't mean it isn't great. Cheers,    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The MfD might have been appropriate if the RfC was clearly going against Cla's stance; but it wasn't.  Thus a FOURTH discussion was opened.  Unfortunately, having 4 discussions opened in such a short period is not going to result in a different result as it is more likely to simply attract the same voices that have chimed in 3 other places.

This is the first article I nominate to GA-review, please tell me if I miss anything. walk victor falk talk 

What about those taken prisoner by the British/Allies in the Middle East. Also those who refused to join the Free French in Britain and were repatriated back to France.?   
I respect this point, but we're talking about close on two million people in prisoner of war camps in Germany. That's what the scholarship covers and it's that which is covered by reliable sources establishing notability. Everything else, a tiny fraction by comparison, is generally only mentioned as a footnote to a general history of the campaign. Yes, French soldiers were probably taken prisoner from Indochina to Britain, North Africa to the Middle East. But they pale into insignificance when compared with the 2 million in Germany and this is why all the titles on the bibliography talk about French prisoners but only deal with the German-held ones. So I see your point, but I can't really do anything about it. It just isn't out there. '  
  Yesterday I was editing Free_France#Syria_and_East_Africa, and as it mentioned how only 5000 out of 40000 chose to join Free France while the rest wanted to be rapatriated, my immediate spontaneous/instinctive reaction was to wish for something like [[French WWII POWs#Vichy prisoners]] to target in this article. However, as  notes, some probably existed but their numbers are vanishlingly small and the result of special circumstances, such as beeing spies, obvious traitors & collaborators and suchlike that does not fall in what is considered a POW by international conventions; For the allies, rank and file Vichy troops were always offered a choice of repatriation, no questions asked, and their incarceration as POWs always a temporary affair.  I can think that more conventional perhaps such existed as Axis and especially Japanese ones after the coup in March 1945 eliminated any fiction of Vichy rule in Indochina, but sources about that might be very elusive to find; and anyway, probably more within the scope of the """"POWs held by the Japanese"""" wikipedia article. At the most, a short sentence summarising the above might be added somewhere, to dispell the same curiosity from readers that you've shown. walk victor falk talk

Try as I might, I'm not really able to associate your Zebra analogy with this article. For it to work, this would have to be an article about the colour white, and even then it doesn't really work. The purpose of my change is to remove the """"comparison"""" nature of the section. It's not meant to be a comparison to begin with. The problem right now is that the section really violates NPOV - it places weight on a comparison with another format, rather than standing by itself.

To be NPOV, this part of the article needs to focus on what support HD DVD has. Issues such as what proportion of the studios support it are obviously relevant. Issues as to whether they support either of the competing formats (incumbent DVD, as well as Blu-ray) aren't really, except insofar as it should be mentioned that the rivaly exists.

The effect of gravitational frequency shift on the GPS system due to general relativity is that a clock closer to a massive object will be slower than a clock farther away. Applied to the GPS system, the receivers are much closer to Earth than the satellites, causing the GPS clocks to be faster by a factor of 5×10^(-10), or about 45.9 μs/day. This gravitational frequency shift is also a noticeable effect.

There is a mistake. Yes, it is true, that the clock father away will be faster due to the weaker gravitional field. However, in case of orbiting satellites the effective gravitational field is completely canceled by the acceleration (remember totaly weightless astronauts in the orbit). According of the postulate of the general relativity theory an steady acceleration is equivalent to a homogenuos gravitational field - the satellite is in the effective zero-field.

 Please help me end this drama once in for all 

I really do hate to get start making accusations, but I feel as if User:Delicious carbuncle is seriously heading down a road of corruption. It all started over a simple proposal at WP:VILLAGE where I skeptically proposed an idea for a template similar to the Template:Romeo warning for silly vandals apparently belonging to cheerleading squads. DC then started questioning my actions at WP:ABUSE, in which case I appropriately addressed his concerns. However, he seems to possibly have a problem with either my involvement at the project or perhaps even the project as a whole. He posted my real life first name, high school, and high school mascot in an example, in which case I raised concerns of WP:OUTING (note that his previous block for outing is unrelated). He said that it was merely a random name he chose, and I've chosen to WP:AGF in the matter, and you may treat that matter however you so desire. After receiving a comment on his talk page from a blatant IP troll that's been harassing me for over a month, he decided to start looking into the trolls claims about my handling of a repeat offender mainly known here as User:LBHS Cheerleader. He started heatedly questioning my actions, asking for diffs about bans. I had removed a """"suspected sockpuppet"""" template stating that the user might be related to User:Bobabobabo (which I had added over a year ago) and replaced it with a banned template since although I feel it's inappropriate that we were using Boba's ban against LBHSC without evidence, I similiarily felt it was inappropriate to all of a sudden to consider her """"debanned."""" I also added LBHSC to the list of community banned users as it seemed to be a consensus to me. I probably should have discussed this first, but I did not in light of WP:BOLD and WP:DENY (I didn't want to start a thread without absolutely needing to). Per WP:DUCK, it seems pretty obvious that LBHSC and her minions have been vandalizing for quite some time, at least since 2006, probably ban-worthy. However, I gracefully removed the contested templates when Delicious carbuncle started a thread at WP:AN/I in attempt to calmly settle the issue, and even stated that I would voluntarily abandon my efforts to combat LBHSC's disruption (beyond non-controversial reverting of blatant vandalism of course). DC ruthlessly refused to compromise, and I even contemplated retirement if only to save my name """"PCHS-NJROTC."""" Even then DC was not satisfied. Several users argued that LBHSC should indeed be considered banned as she would likely never be unblocked, including highly respected admins. Many editors, administrators, and even members of the WP:ArbCom have expressed their opinion that DC should move on. Even an admin who felt I had acted out of line and should be blocked stated that there's not enough support to keep the discussion going. Although there were those who defended my actions 100%, felt that although that the user should be banned but I should have discussed first, felt that I was being power hungry, and even thought that my actions were abusive, the general consenus of everybody was that I had offered settlement, learned important lessons, and that good faith should be assumed. Despite consensus, DC continued to revive the discussion over and over again, providing nothing new, and basically insisting on action. He has been warned repeatedly by several respected editors. He had stopped, and I had disengaged. I really wish this could have stayed in the past. However, Delicious carbuncle started User:Delicious_carbuncle/PCHS-NJROTC_ban_redux in the dawn of the new year. Considering the edit summary he used when creating the page, I initially thought his intentions were to use that as an arguement against someone who he is in conflict with known as User:Neutralhomer. In desire to not be involved in his conflict, I nominated the page for deletion at WP:MFD. I viewed it simply as an attack page which did not help the encyclopedia. I could have nominated for WP:CSD, but I didn't want to say that he was """"attacking me"""" as I was in favor of disengagement as was recommended at AN/I.

The whole of the British Press is reporting the speculation that Ben Collins is the Stig.  This is not a recent phenomena, as newspapers have been suggesting this since at least January.  However, recent articles have, for the most part, dropped specific refrences to any individual other than Ben Collins in this role.  Seeing as one of the main reasons for the Stig being mentioned in secondary sources (like the press) is due to his identity, this is some of the most important information about the role and ought to be in the lead section.  Since Ben Collins has repeatedly been linked to the role in the press (unlike anybody else), this should be clearly mentioned.  Since the speculation that the Stig is Ben Collins is highly relevant and verifiable, comment should be made of this speculation in the lead.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Could you give it a look-see relative to your background in the War of 1812?

 Strange edit 

Can you explain this edit? It seems to me to replace perfectly good punctuation with strange punctuation that makes nonsense of the sentence. Have I misunderstood? I don't understand the edit summary comment about """"reject[ing] the Wikipedia ethos"""", but whatever you think of an editor, that does not justify reverting a perfectly constructive edit.   
I have no problem with the commasbut the previous """"edit summary"""" was obscene and disgusting and degrading to Wikipedia and could not be allowed to stand.  
I agree that the edit summary was unhelpful (though """"obscene and disgusting and degrading"""" seems somewhat of an overstatement). However, to revert a good edit because you don't like the accompanying edit summary makes no sense, and besides, the edit summary still does stand, as reverting the edit does not remove the edit summary.   
the statement I consider obscene, disgusting and degrading was """"who wrote this originally? an illiterate american(did I just repeat myself), or a fucking 2 year old?)"""". That bespeaks an editor who does not respect the Wikipedia ethosand a """"comma fanatic"""" willing to make such outrageous statements over a trivial comma issue.   
The comma in question does seem to have affected the meaning of the sentence—it is not the sort of """"take it or leave it"""" comma which only a comma fanatic would insist on. We may therefore be dealing with some sort of all-purpose grammar fanatic, who threatens myriad rude improvements. Only time will tell.   
OK, Rjensen, thanks for pointing that out. I had assumed that you were referring to the edit summary in the edit that you reverted in the edit I linked to.

Kosovo is the drug-trading hot-spot, and so is Albania. Half of the population of Albania are still farmers, using tools that were used centuries ago. Albania has a large gray economy that may be as large as 50% of official GDP. Now, as far as wars are concerned, Albanians have, only in the last 15 years, started three, one in Kosovo, one in South Serbia (Presevo Valley), and one in Macedonia. All were wars of secession, wherever they go, they want to separate. This is not propaganda, this is fact, and anyone in the world can check it. Comparing to Serbia's percentage of 96% who can read and write, Albania's percentage of 86% sounds low. I have never heard, in my 16 years of living in Serbia, that Albanians have tails, I'm affraid you made that up. Furthermore, the Greater Albania concept still lives in Albania, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia, Macedonia and Greece, while the """"Greater Serbia"""" dream has faded away long ago.

They are normally defined as topological manifolds with an atlas, whose transition maps are smooth, which is used to pull back the differential structure"""" (emphasis mine).  The point is not whether differentiable manifolds can be defined without an atlas (I already pointed out that they can also be defined with sheaves), but that the classical definition that most mathematicians are still using is the atlas definition. Markus is correct that the choice of an atlas for a topological manifold doesn't matter, but to be a manifold I will contend that it must have some atlas. Defining the sphere as a set of zeroes is implicitly embedding the sphere into another space. It has already been pointed out several times that a topological sphere does not have a unique differentiable manifold structure. How is the differentiable manifold structure induced by the embedding, and (more to the point) how can one understand the corresponding differentiable manifold structure on a topological sphere without mentioning this embedding? Topological spaces are not equipped with embeddings a priori. That a sphere with a differentiable manifold structure has a topological embedding into euclidean space does not at all imply that the differentiable structure was induced by this embedding. -

 Same-sex marriage in the United States 

I've undone your revert on the intro to this article, because although it's in good faith, I think it's mistaken. The reason you gave was that the information is elsewhere in the article, which is already long, so the intro shouldn't cover it even in summary, as it's in the main body under """"History"""". Although I respect your intent of keeping it concise and avoiding redundancy, the Manual of Style for the intro is quite clear:
 The lead serves as an introduction to the article and a summary of its most important aspects ... [It] should be able to stand alone as a concise overview. It should define the topic, establish context, explain why the topic is notable, and summarize the most important points, including any prominent controversies ... The lead is the first part of the article most people read, and many only read the lead.

The issue here is that the intro currently says that state bans were declared unlawful in 2015, 38+ states provided some rights as from 2003, and Windsor gave federal rights in 2013. There needs to be some mention of the backdrop and prior controversies as they were huge, and an increase from 2 to 3 paras to add substance on the background + context is (in my view) appropriate: even very long articles still need a proper introduction that summarizes their contents. Take a look at African-American Civil Rights Movement (1954–68) for an example of the intro to a long-ish article.

It has a big natural resource in fish due to be a continental shelf larger than Greenland size. Estimates of biomass and abundance were produced for
eight commercial species. The total biomass was 245 000 tonnes and Patagonian toothfish
(Dissostichus eleginoides) accounted for half of the value (124 000 tonnes). The fish biomass
was distributed between the shelf and the deep sea. However, this evaluation remains
incomplete.http://www.ccamlr.org/ccamlr_science/Vol-16-2009/01Duhamel-Hautecoeur.pdf

The continental shelf teem with life, because of the sunlight available in shallow waters, in contrast to the biotic desert of the oceans' abyssal plain. The pelagic (water column) environment of the continental shelf constitutes the neritic zone, and the benthic (sea floor) province of the shelf is the sublittoral zone.Pinet 316-17, 418-19.
Most commercial exploitation from the sea, such as metallic-ore, non-metallic ore, and hydrocarbon extraction, takes place on the continental shelf. Sovereign rights over their continental shelves up to a depth of 200 metres or to a distance where the depth of waters admitted of resource exploitation were claimed by the marine nations that signed the Convention on the Continental Shelf drawn up by the UN's International Law Commission in 1958. This was partly superseded by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/8_1_1958_continental_shelf.pdf which created the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone and extended continental shelf rights for states with physical continental shelves that extend beyond that distance.

France extend its jurisdiction over 567 732 square kilometers of the neighboring continental shelf from the land area of 7 215 resulting in 574 947 square kilometers. There are besides some fishing boats and vessels, owned by fishermen on Réunion Island, a department of France approximately 3,300 km (2,100 miles) to the north, who are licensed to fish within the archipelago's Exclusive Economic Zone.

Govern of France principal activities on the Kerguelen Islands focus mostly on scientific research, earth sciences and biology. 
The so-called Kerguelen microcontinent or Kerguelen Plateau include charcoal and conglomerate fragments of gneiss indicate that much of the plateau was above sea level an covered by dense conifer forest.  Tt sanks 20 million years ago and is now  below sea level. It has sedimentary rocks similar to the ones found in Australia and India, suggesting it was gondwanan origen.

The former sounding rocket range to the east of Port-aux-Français  is currently the site of a SuperDARN radar.

Since 1992, the French Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES) has operated a satellite and rocket tracking station which is located four kilometers east of Port-aux-Français. There was a need for a tracking station in the Southern Hemisphere, and the French government required that it be located on French territory, rather than in a populated, foreign place like Australia or New Zealand.""""

 Polyspermy 

Before you revert the stable version - please discuss this first on the talk page. As for your question:
Look at the beginning of the third line. The Talmud quotes the verse from 1 Samuel 17, 4, which goes as follows: """"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines"""", right? Now, look at your Bible - ibid., and see the full verse: """"And there went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines, named Goliath..."""". Right?
So, the Talmud quotes the verse about Goliath, and then: interprates this verse - using a pun - in the following way (see the Talmud ibid. in that third line): """"One hundred foreskins of Philistines - got her [i.e. his mother] pregnant"""". In other words: the Talmud explains, that the biblical words """"And there went out a champion"""" - mean:  """"And there was created/born a champion"""", and it also explains that the biblical words: """"out of the camp of the Philistines"""", mean: """"out of a hundred foreskins of Philistines"""". Note that this fantastic interpretaion made by the Talmud - is based on a pun: the word for """"camp"""" is similar to (i.e. sounds like) """"a hundred foreskins"""" (not in English of course). Note also that fantastic interpretaions for the Bible - are very common in the Talmud.
Now, look ibid. at the next line (i.e. the fourth line); The Talmud now explains how - having so many fathers - is really possible from a biological point of view, so the Talmud continues: """"Rav Matania said: no controversy over that; as long as the sperm [of the first man] hasn't gotten rotten [in the woman's body] yet, a woman can get pregnant by two men - all at once"""".
Notice that all of the Talmud's commentators explain all of this - as I did.
Hope this helps. Anyway, next time, please consult pefore you revert the stable version.

 Should you stay or should you go now..... 

Your problems here began with the improper and unsourced edits you made to the bio of Andrei Treivas Bregman (alias Michael Lucas), at the behest of Lucas. Lucas listed on the talkpage of the bio the changes he wanted. An anonymous editor suggested that you had done this in exchange for sexual favors from Lucas  it had nothing to do with any foreign trips you made. With these edits, you reversed your earlier edits and contradicted your earlier statements regarding the content  content you eventually changed for Lucas. Later, you engaged in a prolonged exchange with another editor over the inclusion of """"Bregman"""" in Lucas's real name. Despite the fact that Bregman is reliably sourced, you removed it like Lucas wanted. Most recently you became embroiled in conflict over the use of your Farrell picture; no need to go into detail about that.

Your recent conduct and your posted word show you to be arrogant, capricious, emotionally needy and teetering on mental instability.

 Collapse by consciousness? Face the consequences! 

If we take the """"collapse by consciousness"""" viewpoint then:

 Consequence 1.

In famous experiments with entanglement (Aspect's, and
other), thousands of entangled pairs are created and measured, each
pair during a microscopically short time; no human observes individual
results in real time (and usually, never at all); rather, a computer
registers them, calculates frequencies (statistical averages) and
displays these to a human observer.

Does it mean, thousand of collapses? No; rather, a single collapse
after the whole experiment. No definite values for individual spin
projections; only a definite value for the average.

 Consequence 2.

Do you believe that human consciousness acts on the microsecond scale?
Probably not. Probably, on the scale of seconds. Then, a collapse
takes about seconds. Then, entanglements could be relevant to
faster-than-light communication only on distances of million
kilometers (or so). Definitely irrelevant in all experiments performed
for now (on the Earth) or planned in the near future.

d82d1a7fb23ceaed,"I'm familiar with Wiki policies on incivility and I always try to be civil in discussions. Your whole case on my alleged incivility builds upon the misguided interpretation of the term nationalism which is not derogatory in English language. None of the links provided define it as such. Yes it can be argued to be semantically close to chauvinism, but chauvinism is a pejorative term, nationalism isn't. There are many related terms which overlap semantically, one having pejorative connotations, other one being neutral. I've asked you where exactly do you see personal attack and you failed to respond. Ignoring Serbian POV on the article on Gundulić is POV-pushing regardless whether you perceive it as such or not. One week block is way to excessive for calling somebody a nationalist. Balkans-related talk page discussions abound in liberal usage of that word by multitude of involved editors, and no one ever felt hurt about it.

When he says """"conquered"""", that is exactly what the term means. Your map is shit. Because Serbs ONLY MADE UP 25% of that land whether it was a bigger or smaller Kosova than today. And I call it KOSOVA because KOSOVA is it's name. It's Serbo-nationalists like you, Dab, and Balkanfever who keep it in it's Milosevic devized name. And you keep going on about the Treaty in London 1913. Well???? What happened???? Certainly nothing to do with Kosova joining Serbia because I said before and I'll say again - if it did, Malcolm would have said it. If he gets things wrong, why is he so well respected by all those reporters in the newspapers listed by Interestedinfairness. Answer that one. Dab, don't confuse the issue. It doesn't matter if Kosova was once it Italy, I tell you that it has never been in Serbia, it only had the bad luck to be in the same """"genocide state"""" as Serbia when a part of Yugoslavia.

Hi Ben! You've recently uploaded and added to articles some images of covers of TVTimes magazine. You've correctly tagged them as fair-use/magazine, but I don't think the images are being used under fair-use considerations.

The tag for fair-use/magazines says:

...It is believed that the use of low-resolution images of magazine covers: to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question,...

The images are being used to illustrate programmes, not the TVTimes magazine. Therefore I'd say they're not being fairly used under the terms of Wikipedia's fair-use copyrights policy.

Additionally, the tag says ...To the uploader: please add a detailed fair use rationale for each use, as described on Wikipedia:Image description page, as well as the source of the work and copyright information. These images do not have a fair use rationale on the image page and they don't provide the source of the work (scan, taken from another website etc).

I suspect that the images will need to be removed from the articles you've put them in, but I'd be interested in hearing your views. Thanks ➨ ❝REDVERS❞

This needed to be clarified since there has been a problem with him inserting subsequent posts ahead of mine, which can be misleading to a reader. When I tried to correct the positions yesterday in another incident, here is what he wrote in his edit summary when he positioned his post ahead of mine again:

01:57, 13 May 2010 The Magnificent Clean-keeper (talk | contribs) m (180,836 bytes) (Undid revision 361800511 by Zlykinskyja (talk)Don't fucking move my comments again. This is plain vandalism) (undo)

So when I objected to his use again of the word """"fucking"""" he then used it at me two more times, as reflected above. This follows a prior incident a few weeks ago when he used the word """"fucking"""" at me. I repeatedly objected and asked him not to do that. I think he did this again because he knew it would upset me because of how upset I was about the prior incident. 

Also, I have been called by someone else a """"bitch"""" and the words """"cunt"""" and """"cock"""" """"shit"""" have been directed at me on this Talk page. I have repeatedly objected and nothing is done. It is as if women who want to contribute here have to put up with a gauntlet of abuse if they wish to stay here.

Mlpearc says he still agrees that I am """"unnotable"""" for thew record and thinks I should be """"speedily deleted.""""

I'm an internationally known author and Holocaust scholar. Amazon sells 19 of my books, only four of which were self-published.

Amazingly, Mlpearc boasts on his Talk page or Wiki internal bio he's a high school drop out but DOES have his GED! I suspect there is a LOT of professional rivalry...in Mlpearc's mind, not in the opinion of Wiki editors who way back in 2011 decided to KEEP my Wiki bio because Wiki DOES think I'm notable.

Mlpearc's comment above about still believing I'm a nobody doesn't rankle me. If there is ONE thing I am NOT insecure about it's my resume and other credentials. But Mlpearc's opinion that I'm not notable sounds rude to me.

Anybody else agree?

Dear bishonen, here you are again, weren't you forbidden to pollute this talk page anymore by your corupted interventions and arbitrary deleeting and bans?

Your actions, as they have always been, are completely discussfull and under all criticisms.
You are nothing but a little stupid idiot coming and called by ybm as he was ban and not by you! of course, for going again against the 3RR rule, and for having insulted enormously people.
You know of course that people following ybm are called by him and his Voyer """"Idiots""""? or did you forgot? so pay a visit to his website and get a free trip to wake-up land.

All my interventions were absolutly relevant and I am the alone person on this talk page acting like a real admi would!
I came as you certainly didnt read it, with a proposition who was suppose to bring an end to all this mess, but ybm and rjb and your friend snowboard and Maru just made it worse.
I have responded to attacks,and certainly not in the same distorded way who is so familiar to them and to you to express themselves, and your removal of my post is a censorship, a compleete censor of my words who are the truth but who disturb you,
You are the valey of ybm and nothing else and seems to enjoy it.
YBM has called Igor Bogdanov a Bastard twice a short time before you blocked me, you have no rights to do so and your excuse about having warn me a lot before is working a little thin don't you think? i do not have been warned ever ever ever ever by you.
Post warning is no warning.
You should be kicked out from wiki as you are absolutely unable to work as an admi.

Where is the """" denial, anti-black, blaha blah and all the non-sense accusations that you are making by me saying that??

After alll, """"Nasal irrigation was originally used at the University of California, San Diego Nasal Dysfunction Clinic after endoscopic sinus surgery""""). Grockl you must have been on this team!

So here is the hilarious and somewhat tricky part. I bet Grockl really patted himself on the back for this one. Grockl cited """"Clinical Study and Literature Review of Nasal Irrigation"""" which, guess what, was authored by UCSD physicians. In this study, there is NO OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE that says pulsatile irrigation is more effective than other irrigation methods EXCEPT in the following reference: """"It has also been shown that pulsatile saline delivery is more effective in removing bacteria than delivery via bulb syringe."""" They then reference a particular study. Guess which one??? -)

""""The efficacy of various irrigation solutions in removing slime-producing Staphylococcus."""" written in the Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma. That's right folks: THE STUDY ABOUT REMOVING BACTERIA FROM IMPLANT SURFACES. Grockl, you tried so hard.

My editing was not poor as anyone can see it for him/herself. But let us take you for your word. You protected the page against my poor editing which is understandable because I am new here. Oh really? Can you show me where in the rules of Wikipedia says protect a page against a newcomer if his editing is poor? Who decided my editing is poor? You! Based on what? Based on your religious fervor! There was nothing wrong with my style that would contravene the standards of Wikipedia. It was the content of what I wrote that you could not stand. You keep justifying your biased action against me hiding behind the rules and fail each and every time to say exactly which rules I broke. There is no rule that I broke. You know that. That is why you constantly act like a mommy talking to a child. “if you behave good we will let you play”. Be specific Ms. SlimVirgin. I can show the rules that you broke. Can you show me the rules that I broke. Can you be specific for once? Why not apologize and demonstrate that you can also be a great person?

Heh.  Terri Schiavo as a flypaper for the priority-challenged.  I like that notion.  ^_^  - 

My dearest sir, you are so correct!  We are going to ramp this up slowly.  Terri Schiavo is not a movie star.  She is an issue about American jurisprudence and how wrong Congressional intervention is.  THAT is her notability.  If you think about it, she is just along for the ride.   

The perspecitve of this article should now change to change to the judges.  It is the politicians were who were the flies. They got swatted away, but she sticks to them, does she not?  Andrew William Morrow   

Let us now see if that little fly """"Musical Linguist"""" takes the bait. Better yet; that she-dog.  Here girl, here girl!  Come and delete this section again! Good girl! Here, I will give you biscuit!   Sooooo... Does any OTHER admin want to come and delete this idea for the sake of some shallow excuse like """"banned user""""?  Huh?  Huh?

By the way, Montanabw, you are effectively retarded. I can source everything I'm saying.

I'm not, however, going to hand them over to you on a silver platter while you feel unristricted in espousing your own ENTIRELY unverifiable claims. Here's a suggestion: read something that isn't written by people lobbying for feral horse protection. You'll get a lot more truthful information out of it. I also don't think it was you that reverted my edit of the Mustang article (not that it needed to be, there are millions of you thoroughly ignorant goons), I was actually looking up sources when I came back and saw it had already been changed and thought; """"Jesus, what's the point?"""" And, once again, you've clearly demonstrated that while you're not at all concerned with accuracy, you still feel you have a right to comment on issues you know next to nothing about.

The dick who is editing with policy is also editing out of policy, by being arrogant, lazy and fucking up the functionality of the Image Workshop. His worrying obsession with NFCC#9 is his excuse for being a twat. he is deliberately making the workshop non-functional. For the IW to work properly we have to be able to either see or be able to link to the image being requested. Now Mr Dick esq comes along, deletes both the image and the link making the request impossible to deal with unless we go looking for an invisible comment hidden in the source code of the request. In spite of being told of 2 methods of maintaining NFCC#9 compliance and maintaining IW functionality Hammersoft refuses to use them. One of the methods only involves putting a colon at the front of the link. But will Hammersoft do this? No, he has refused point blank. This I firmly definitely and firmly puts him in the """"dick"""" category. His arrogance, his laziness, his Borg-like obsession with NFCC#9 and his truculence are disrupting a valuable resource with WP for no purpose. I would be grateful if you could copy and paste this as a response to his accusations at the incident board. Especially now you've effectively stopped me posting there. This is not an unblock request as I don't care one way or another, it's WP's loss if I can't sort out image requests for 24hrs, it's not my loss.

2250ebe3581ef161,"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

Espionage or a dick spying on some pussy lovers involves an individual obtaining information that is considered secret or confidential without the permission of the holder of the information. Espionage is inherently clandestine, as the legitimate holder of the information may change plans or take other countermeasures once it is known that the information is in unauthorized hands. See clandestine HUMINT for the basic concepts of such information collection, and subordinate articles such as clandestine HUMINT operational techniques and clandestine HUMINT asset recruiting for discussions of the """"tradecraft"""" used to collect this information.
Hey I gotta joke and it goes like this:Dick says """"Hey Balls get ready for a patry"""" Balls replies """"You fucking liar. Everytime we go to a party, you always go in and leave us out here knockin.  

History
Incidents of espionage are well documented throughout history. The ancient writings of Chinese and Indian military strategists such as Sun-Tzu and Chanakya contain information on deception and subversion. Chanakya's student Chandragupta Maurya, founder of the Maurya Empire, made use of assassinations, spies and secret agents, which are described in Chanakya's Arthasastra. The ancient Egyptians had a thoroughly developed system for the acquisition of intelligence, and the Hebrews used spies as well, as in the story of Rahab. Feudal Japan often used ninja to gather intelligence. More recently, spies played a significant part in Elizabethan England (see Francis Walsingham). Many modern espionage methods were well established even then. http://www.henrywotton.org.uk/

The Cold War involved intense espionage activity between the United States of America and its allies and the Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China and their allies, particularly related to nuclear weapons secrets. Recently, espionage agencies have targeted the illegal drug trade and those considered to be terrorists.

Different intelligence services value certain  intelligence collection techniques over others. The former Soviet Union, for example, preferred  human sources over  research in open sources, while the United States has tended to emphasize technological methods such as SIGINT and IMINT. Both Soviet political (KGB) and military intelligence (GRU
 ) officers were judged by the number of agents they recruited. 

Various Forms
Unlike other forms of  intelligence collection disciplines, espionage usually involves accessing the place where the desired information is stored, or accessing the people who know the information and will divulge it through some kind of subterfuge. There are exceptions to physical meetings, such as the Oslo Report, or the insistence of Robert Hanssen in never meeting the people to whom he was selling information.

The US defines espionage towards itself as """"The act of obtaining, delivering, transmitting, communicating, or receiving information about the national defense with an intent, or reason to believe, that the information may be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of any foreign nation. Espionage is a violation of 18 United States Code 792-798 and Article 106, Uniform Code of Military Justice{{cite web

Killer, I'm sorry that you have misread my unblock request. If you re-read it you will see that my use of """"pop-eyed chihuahua"""" there refers specifically, accurately and unequivocally to the dog displayed on your user page and not to you. I cited it to explain to why I used that imagery in the WP:PA, as otherwise it would appear inexplicably random. The explanation was not, as you seem to think, offered in mitigation. Indeed my original unblock request, which I condensed at the request of admin Hersfold, stated: 

The following will help the reviewing admin(s) to understand what otherwise would appear to be a random choice of metaphors.[...] Killer has a picture of a pop-eyed chihuahua dog on her user page,  captioned “I look like this”; and she is in the habit of referring to herself, in her sysopping summaries, as a dog   e.g. “Puppy has spoken.” Stupidly I exploited this canine imagery at Killer’s expense.'' 

I edited out that section along with others in an effort to comply with Hersfold's request.

My unblock request in no way implies that it is 'somehow OK to insult' you because you refer to yourself as 'puppy'. It simply explains where the idea for the canine imagery came from. It does not attempt to excuse my using it to insult you.

I have apologised, and still do, for my rude and offensive references to you personally in the WP:PA; and ask that you graciously accept my apology as sincere, which it is.   """,1,0,0,0,0,0

My mother is always yelling at me and my dad beats the shit out of me if I get fucking out of line. My brother's one outlet is wikipedia. He cried when he saw my father smacking me, and his tears clogged his mac book pro's keyboard. we had to go to fucking apple and get a new one, all out of my mom's pocket. then last night i wanted to take this hot pussy from connecticut out in my dad's new rolls-royce and he said fucking no. so you know what I fucking did? I fucking cut his pinky off and didnt snitch like a little bitch like you.

Hey asshole.

Stop putting in the redundant phrase """"a claim unsupported by other modern or ancient sources"""", shitface. The Encyclopedia Iranica does indeed find support in the ancient sources (considering how many troops Ariobarzanes brought with himself to the battle of Gaugamela, and the nature of the location of the battle of the Persian Gates which could IMPOSSIBLY house any of the estimates given by Hammond or Waldemar Heckel) The Greek numbers given are obviously inflated and have no root in historical reality. How can Ariobarzanes magically summon more troops than Darius III Codomannus at Ecbatana (where the greater part of the nobility followed him)? Explain that to me, cuntface.

So stop being a shithead, pretty please? I will not relent in removing that phrase. It is stupid on so many levels and serves only as an attempt to discredit the Encyclopedia Iranica, when in fact it does a better job at cutting down customarily inflated Greek estimates than Hammond who takes his numbers straight from the Imperial Roman author Curtius-Rufus (Which was a thinly veiled political exaltation of emperor Vespasian).

[Verse 1]
Konnichiwa, senpai
Please notice me
I watch Asian cartoons
I'm a weeaboo

I live in my mom's house
I'm like 32
I collect swords and throwing stars
'Cause I'm a weeaboo

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I will always be one step ahead of you
Because I read the manga
(You're such a fucking pleb, are you even even Japanese bro?)

I haven't showered in like 16 weeks
All my friends and peers are ashamed of me
'Cause all of a sudden
I think I'm Japanese

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm a weeaboo (x4)
A filthy weeaboo
(Naruto's so overrated)
A dirty weeaboo
(You wanna see my katana collection?)
A fucking weeaboo
(I'm learning Japanese on Rosetta Stone)
A disgusting weeaboo
(So I'm like basically Japanese now)

[Verse 2]
I sit at my computer desk
And argue with teenagers on the internet
About atheism
And how Japan is superior to other countries
I learned a bit of Japanese
So now i'm qualified to be a part of their community
So i made my avatar a kawaii waifu

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm a weeaboo
(Uh duh, everybody wears kimonos)
Yes, I'm a weeaboo
(Ninjas are still real, okay?)
Yes, I'm a weeaboo
(Uh, k-konnichiwa)
Yes, I'm a weeaboo
(Domo arigato)
A filthy weeaboo
(...)
A dirty weeaboo
A fucking weeaboo

 WOW!!!! You edited the comment making me look like a classic idiot fanatic right? WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW YOURE GOOD, AND ALSO HAVE 00000000 morale... Knowing beforehand you have no morales however I barricaded myself by posting elsewhere too, so gj ian thomson!!!!:D. Heres a link to what the comment actually looked like: http://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy/comments/2nsl5l/911_conspiracy_extending_to_wikipedia/
Thought it might as well stand there too since nothing but cencorship can be expected by some sheep on wikipedia only just recently realizing that his whole life, his wife and kids, is just there to serve a master, and therefore fanatically defending his beliefs to the contrary despite overwhelming evidence. You can go back you your boring life now Ian. I dont expect this """"no evidence from experts"""" thread to stand for long anyway sheep. And this was supposed to be an objective lexcon!!! Learn something new everyday I guess, or as in your case, rather not because it would mean you life ment nothing:D Keep living in denial Ian, and dont forget to cencor!!! I maen where would we be without cencorship, free and informed ppl? Cant have that...""",1,0,0,0,0,0

I want to bring your OWN STANCE, as being pro orthodox which in itself is BIASED!

i am again going to put the changes back on, BECAUSE I believe your STANCE IS TO PROTECT THE CURRENT SINGH SABHA ideological stance on sikhism, WHICH MEANS that wikipedia ONLY ACCEPTS ORTHODOX POV and NOT unorthodox! Which means going by your OWN judgment, that the CHRISTIAN UNORTHODOX CHURCH, which exist, on real life and on wiki, HAS NO merit!
