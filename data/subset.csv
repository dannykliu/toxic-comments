I have followed this whole case including the Arb where again you seem content to falsify history, this time claiming, 'the Gordian Knot was a greek mess solved by a Macedonian.'

In response to the section below, if there were no Arab Jewish tribes, there are certainly Arab Jews. Despite the fact that many Jews in the Middle East left (or were encouraged to leave) during the 1950s and 60s to non-Arabic speaking countries, many still keep their identity as both Arabs and Jews. Continued pressure within the Jewish community to act more like the Eastern European-descendant Jews only means that it is all the more important to recognize Jewish people of Arab descent (and whose first language was often Arabic, then Hebrew) on this page. It would make sense to do so, however, with the caveat that some Arabic-speaking Jews identify both as Jews and as Arabs, while some do notjust as it's done for Christians from the Arab world on this page.

As for my translation of the Chinese Redology page, I kind of got frustrated because my Chinese ability is not quite good enough to do a good translation.  English is my native language, I'm only a third-year student of Chinese.  Someone else seems to have translated some of the material and put it on our Redology page.

Copyright issues
Content introduced into this article in 2007 very closes follows at least two of its sources. While facts are not copyrightable, creative elements of presentation – including both structure and language – are. For an example of close paraphrasing, consider the following:
SOURCE: http://www.cielodrive.com/rosemary-labianca.php
He allowed her to put a dress on over her nightgown before he led her into the living room where Tex Watson already had Leno tied up. Charlie and Tex reassured the couple that they wouldn't be hurt, and were just being robbed. After collecting all the cash in the house Manson had Tex bring Rosemary back to her bedroom where he placed a pillowcase over her head and gagged her with a lamp cord. He told her to stay quiet and remain in the room, which she did. Tex returned to the living room and Charlie left. Within a few minutes Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel entered the residence and were instructed by Tex to go to Rosemary's bedroom. 

The article says:
He allowed her to put a dress on over her nightgown before leading her into the living room where Watson had Leno tied up. Manson and Watson reassured the couple that they wouldn't be hurt, and were just being robbed. After collecting all the cash in the house, Manson ordered Watson to take Rosemary back to her bedroom where Watson placed a pillowcase over her head, wound a lamp cord around her head, and gagged her with the lamp cord. He told her to stay quiet and remain in the room. Watson returned to the living room and Manson then left the house. Within a few minutes, Leslie Van Houten and Patricia Krenwinkel entered the residence upon Manson's orders and were instructed to do everything Watson said, they then were told by Watson to go to the bedroom.
Although this may be a particularly close stretch, there are others, including in the biography section of Leno. Other sources may also be impacted.

Would it be possible to suggest that religion (according to Cicero, from Latin  re- """"again"""" + legere """"read"""") is a human survival strategy which allows those within to co-operate in securing their future - sometimes at the expense of their neighbors' survival. 

Hence th prohibition about killing and the 'just war' philosophy. It is significant that the scriptural (i.e. written) Judaic origin of the world and the garden of Eden is closely linked to the time and place (Ur was around Basra in modern Iraq) where writing was invented. The peripatetic Jewish nation  invaded Palestine (land of the Philistines) after, and their holy writings record much of this. 

Maybe as a westerner I am convinced by the Evolutionary psychology theory. Is this becoming a religion too? I agree however that Wikipedia should be neutral, and the King James is certainly not suitable here    08:41, 6 May""",0,0,0,0,0,0

(see English French German cathedrals). They were the largest architectural challenge until the invention of skyscrapers. The medieval English Windsor Castle (see the photos on that arcitcle) was even bigger than the largest imperial palace of the Roman Empire (the so-called famous Nero palace). The ancient European and renaissance mathematic philiosophy theatre , sculpture fine-arts paintings are also much finer than Chinese or Japanese. Western European technology and civilization became much developed around the 14th century than the Eastern high cultures. The metallurgy and steal industry were much developed than the eastern too.The development of Eastern science and technology stopped around the 14th century.

To a first approximation, ignoring drag effects, if you take a siphon that is operating in vacuum and start lowering it into the atmosphere, the liquid in the tube above the lower reservoir will be in compression and without tension if its height above the surface of its reservoir is less than the barometric height at that ambient pressure. The liquid above the barometric height will be in tension. Thus a siphon at low pressures or an extremely tall siphon, could be operating with BOTH the chain model AND the atmospheric model at the same time! But as the barometric height exceeds the crest of the siphon, as is typical in practical siphons, there would be no more tension, and the chain model would no longer apply.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I never pursued the matter beyond that, nor did I file a complaint regarding the emails, nor did I even remember it occurred until I logged back on after a few months away to edit an article I'd previously written and found your many messages to me.

As far as I know, it is your interest in pursuing this I am accommodating and the characterization of a """"song and dance"""" is not one I feel is appropriate to describe my total ambivalence to your inquiry (please understand - the preceding is not intended to be trite, I simply want to unambiguously communicate that the entire matter is one of no interest to me, so as to assuage any concerns of a """"song and dance""""). 
 I would like to personally apologize to you for not responding to your interrogatories """"forthwith."""" I can only give you my personal assurance that I did not leave Wikipedia for two months as part of a scheme to evade your investigation. I know you've said you're incredulous to that notion, but I will offer you this personal assurance anyway. 
 Kindly accept this post in the spirit in which it was intended - as a frank and direct response to concerns you are expressing - and not as a slight in any way. If I have failed to communicate something here with appropriate finesse, understand it is only because of serious IRL issues I currently face that limit the time I can commit to pursuing online intrigue, and absolutely not because I am trying to scandalize you. 
If there is anything else I can help you with, please do not hesitate to let me know, however, in interests of wrapping this up in a succinct manner, I would like to suggest we terminate this back-and-forth and allow ArbCom to do whatever it is their role in this is supposed to be. Best -

 Canvassing 

Hi KaragouniS, you may not have been aware of it, but the kind of vote canvassing you've been doing for the football template is rather seriously frowned upon. Can I ask you to stop? Thanks,  ☼ 
Ah yes, just going to say the same thing. └ ' / talk ┐ 

Honestly, I have no idea what's going on in the football pages. Apparently there have been precedents and some perceived consensus among football editors that only world championship teams should have such templates. Nothing I personally care very much about, to be honest.  ☼ 

No, KaragouniS, Greek users should not have been notified before it was put up for deletion.  All the other templates of the group are deleted, so it's clearly ripe for deletion.  And to notify all the Greek football users individually means slanting the !votes towards keep for that reason.  This is an encyclopedia for everyone, even when it comes to Greek football templates, and the !votes should be universal. └ ' / talk ┐ 

I am the third about canvassing the votes. Please do not do it again. It is divisive and disruptive.

Hello. Thank you for your recent edits regarding football players. Your edit included one or more links to the page defender, which is a disambiguation page. This type of page is intended to direct users to more specific topics. Ordinarily we try to avoid creating links to disambiguation pages, since it is preferable to link directly to the specific topic relevant to the context. You can help Wikipedia by revising the links you added to defender to refer directly to the most relevant topic, such as defender (football) by writing out [[defender (football)|defender]]. Regards,   

As a typing tip, you might also consider using the Help:Pipe trick. That is, type only [[defender (football)|]] which will automatically produce the correct [[defender (football)|defender]] when you press save. -) Silver

Fair use rationale for Image:AlexKiddManga.png

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:AlexKiddManga.png. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

Apart from any Basque influences, Celtic seems to have Non IE terms concentrated mostly in the British Isles, where they were joined by the Anglo-Frisians and Norse.  It is blatantly clear to anybody that the Mediterranean influence on High German is astounding.  The older Nordic and Germanic writings appear less structured and thought out, but the more evolution into current speech, the tongues have been so standardised by latinisation, especially.  One cannot seriously refute that the Anglo-Frisian and West Norse tongues follow the least marked latinising structures on their tongues of the Germanic languages(and especially borrowing scientific terms), apart from writing them in latin script, with a few native letters especially in Icelandic to this day.  The Baltic East Norse tongues gained a considerable conversion by the influence of the Low German speakers of the Hanseatic League in their everyday life, most notable in the Hanseatic Cities, like Visby on Gotland.  Since High German has been standardising itself all throughout Germany, having a marked effect upon such others as Austrian and Swiss German, all the dialects of Germany and even in Eastern Europe are suffering at the officialisation and BBC type overtaking.

 Bias? 

It seems a little weighted towards Al-Megrahi being wrongly convicted, just does not read neutral to me. I've subsequently tagged the article, to see if anyone could take a look and see if they can do anything about it. Cheers.   

Well, according to the article:

...the SCCRC concluded its four-year review and, having uncovered evidence that a miscarriage of justice could have occurred...

So, giving some considerable weight to doubts about his guilt would be justified.   

That is true, but it stands that he is a convicted mass murderer who took the lives of hundreds of people. To have the majority of the article weighted towards his alleged innocence/appeals etc seems disproportionately biased in his favour. While I know that there is obviously a distinct article on the bombing, it doesn't quite seem appropriate that the article about the guilty party is leaning heavily towards innocence. In light of the dropping of the appeal, it seems somewhat unlikely that he will be exhonerated, so it's not even as if Megrahi's status, in a legal sense, will alter (in terms of innocent vs guilty, rather than incarcerated vs free). I'm not sure what to do to alter the article, which is why I tagged it, to see if anyone else had any ideas. I accept entirely what you're saying, and I even agree, I just, like I said, find that focus disproportionate.   

This legal speak is very cautious. """"A miscarriage of justice could have occurred"""" means in reality that it is practically certain that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. So, he is convicted, yes, but a mass murderer, no, the guilty party, no, most likely not. Concerning the future, nobody knows, but there remains a strong pressure to reopen the case.213.84.53.62  

My understanding of the legal status is that """"A miscarriage of justice could have occurred"""" does not, by any stretch, mean that the occurrence of such a miscarriage is """"practically certain.""""  If you have evidence to that effect, I would be happy to see it.  It only means that there is sufficient reason to justify the time and expense of further investigation.  We should also be wary of political pressures on the relevant actors in this case, coming from both directions, and to me this diminishes the weight of several quotations in favor of al-Megrahi; there was significant pressure on law enforcement agencies to put someone away for the Lockerbie bombing, and just as surely there was just as much pressure on Libya and its friends to exonerate him, due to the sanctions and damage to international reputation and etc.  This is why I think less weight should be given to quotations and more weight to the hard evidence. 

Perhaps the article would read a little less biased if it actually included some of the relevant points from the original case against him? It doesn't really tell a reader why he was convicted in the first place.-12.70.92.162  

I absolutely agree.  First, the weight of the evidence in favor of a conviction should be given.  The page says nothing about what he is accused of doing and why the judges reached the conclusion they did.  Second, even though reasons have been given to doubt the conviction, responses to those reasons should also be given.  Presumably those who remain convinced of al-Megrahi's guilt, especially those who were involved in the initial trial, have offered responses to the allegations of a miscarriage of justice.  Al-Megrahi was convicted; this much is fact.  Voices should be heard that believe the conviction was wrong, and voices should be heard that believe it was right.  It is partly the absence of this secondary response that gives the article a prejudiced feel to me.  

Having read the entire article, I must agree with Sky83 and 12.70.92.162. How many times is the phrase """"miscarriage of justice"""" used here? There is actually very little information provided to show a miscarriage of justice took place (One of Hans Koechler's reason for doubting the validity of the conviction: """"A retired Scottish police officer has signed a statement confirming that the evidence that found Al-Megrahi guilty was fabricated. The police chief, whose identity has not yet been revealed, testified “that the CIA planted the tiny fragment of circuit board crucial in convicting a Libyan” for the bombing of the Pan Am jet (Scotland on Sunday, 28 August 2005).""""

Guys, I do not see you taking steps to Wikipedia:Requests for mediation.

I can not do this job because I always connect from """"filtered"""" institutional net-access, and following those steps could result in new, undesired, controversial """"truncation"""" of words by the software. I do not want that happenning.

Could you please follow the instructions in the link I provided?. Thank you. 

 Randroide answers to New reference by Burgas00 

  At last we agree on something!...of course that the new section is a good idea: The false """"suicidal"""" terrorists from PRISA will also be included there. 

Come oooooon, boys, start writing that section. I do not want all the kudos for myself: The new proposed article is, by now, an effort made only by me. 

But remember: NPOV and sources, all the sources. Just like me citing """"El País"""" in the section about the doubts about the genuineness of the 13th bomb. Cheers  

 

Indeed, a good point. And all the remarks in COPE too. And the """"moral certitudes"""" of Mariano Rajoy published in El Mundo.

  I agree with you 100%, Larean.

  What Randroide omits to mention on the section about the 13th bomb is that he only added balancing references when I insisted that he do so, the original version he created was entirely POV, as is much of the rest of the proposed article. Also, all the sources that he added from El Pais are only available to subscribers - NPOV it is not. 

  You are right, Southofwatford, in your """"Randroide omits..."""" section.

If you have not subscription to """"El País"""", I am sorry but that´s your problem. My """"institutional"""" access also has some advantages, like paid access to """"El País"""" (and many, many other publications and books). That´s one of the reasons for my exclusive use of """"filtered"""" Internet accesss: It´s much easier for me to work here due to the easy availability of sources.

Do you see?. The truncation of words is offsett (I think) by better sources.

BTW, if you write under a """"Randroide answers"""" section you are:
Invading """"my"""" space. I do not mind, really. But you are doing it.
Risking new truncations on your messages. To avoid this, please write OUTSIDE """"Randroide answers"""" sections.

If you think that the proposed article is POV, work in it to make it NPOV. The article is not """"mine"""".

  I'll take the risk of you truncating the reply and put it here, it's very short. The issue is not whether I subscribe to El País, its whether the people who read an article in the English Wikipedia subscribe to it. All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article, putting in a source that readers will not be able to see just so you can claim the article is NPOV is, to my mind, completely unreasonable.

  

All sources used should be accessible to all readers of the article

Very funny, Southofwatford. 

I am going to follow this joke of yours.

It´s a pleasure to read this kind of funny jokes, really. I had a good laugh.

User:Southofwatford  How strange that you should find it so funny, after all most of the sources we are providing should enable users to find out more information about what is being sourced, so to deliberately choose sources that require those users to pay to see the information is not funny, it's simply bizarre. Equally, in the English Wikipedia I would argue that choosing a Spanish or other foreign language source when an equally valid source exists in English does not make sense, except perhaps to those who are too busy laughing - your cynicism is evident in your response.

Fact is that the Britons were in an anti-Angles coalition and the Angles came with their whole volk to defeat them. If the Britons had contact to the former Roman Empire is unclear but possible. They lived under Roman rule for centuries and were romanized. This defeat was something like de-romanizing to them after 500 years of Roman rule.

 Davey2010 

I just read WP:BATTLE and WP:AGF, and accordingly I find your message to Davey mentioning me in that context (while deliberately trying to hide it from me) as extremely upsetting. I have nothing personal against Davey (despite what he claims), I am certainly not trying to make him afraid or upset or otherwise miserable. If he tries to claim I am, I will vigorously defend myself against such lies. If anyone has been treated unfairly, it has been me by him - he reported me for being a VANDAL for crying out loud! I assume you know exactly how wrong that was (I sadly only properly realised that after the event). AGF says """"If criticism is needed, discuss editors' actions, but avoid accusing others of harmful motives without clear evidence."""" Well, I have quite a lot of clear evidence now that Davey's lack of care in the subject area of buses/bus transport can only really be explained by him having a motive that is harmful to Wikipedia (to degrade the overall quantity and quality of its content on the subject). How else can you explain the phenomena of someone who claims to be a bus enthusiast and know a lot about buses, not having any clue how or why a list of trolleybus routes would be encyclopedic? Entire books have been written on just that subject! This is just one example. I have many more. If he had never claimed to know a lot about this subject, then yes, I could have assumed that this was just a case of amateurish but entirely innocent intent. But not any more. He clearly has a very specific idea about what Wikipedia should and should not contain on this subject, and it is quite clearly not explicitly supported by any of the rules. So, he is pushing the envelope far beyond the limits, and in some cases there's only one word to describe the things he says - pure lies. I'm sorry he's upset by the fact that I have the subject knowledge to be able to spot when he's not being truthful about certain things he says on this subject, and I'm sorry that he's upset that when he says something here breaks some rule or other, I actually take the time to check if that's true or not. But do not for a second confuse that with someone who is genuinely upset by someone stalking them or questioning their motives for no good reason. I could even go so far to say these might even be crocodile tears, since he doesn't appear to have been this sensitive over other issues where people are disagreeing with him - indeed he seems quite capable of telling people in no uncertain terms what he thinks of them. This is no shrinking violet, that's for sure.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Hi Edward. You have a few options. First is to start on the article talk page, which I see you've already done. I know a few days has already gone by, but maybe ping your posting again and see what happens. 
 Your next step would be to bring this to WP:RPP and request semi-protection, but make sure you have your evidence at hand. Gather a few diffs (both your edits and the IP edits), and show that you've attempted resolution on the talk page. Look at other requests for PP and see what the standard type of format is, and successful or denied reasons; that'll give you a good idea how to submit your request. If the reviewing admin agrees, the page won't be editable by IP editors.

What I need everyone to understand is that the BC-17 program is NOT dead. It is NOT Boeing's decision as to whether it continues. It is NOT the FAA's decision as to whether it continues. It is NOT even the USAF's (the used aircraft aspect of the initiative takes Boeing out of the influence loop save for maintaining of the aircraft functioning in a dual Commercial/Military role) decision. That power rests with Congress and the SECDEF, and even that's not absolute owing to the national and economic security issues involved in C-17 line continuance and the task of the BC-17 to be the core of a US/NATO controlled heavy and outsized industry subset of Air cargo. The Russians and Ukrainians control this, as you know with their AN-124s. requiring the US military to compensate for airlift shortfalls through the use of the Ruslans on a fairly regular basis.

If any of our august colleagues in the Wiki-sphere are going to weigh with comments, I strongly suggest that you review the Roche paper developed by Ronis and Stokes at the SECAF's request in 2001. It would also work well to review the linked presentation to the SpeedNews Aerospace and Defense Conference presentation from 2007. This way, we're all on the same page.

 Issue with an editor 

Hi there Bhadani. Recently there has been an user Aftab Kiran whose contributions are limited to just 3 topics, Operation Polo, Nizam and Hyderabad State. He seems to revert to his POV version of history which isn't backed up by references and despite other editors reverting his edits, he continues to revert. I've spoken to him, but he has behaved in an uncivil manner abusing me as being one of those who destroyed the Babri Masjid! I hope you can either block him or semiprotect those pages to avoid his editing because he's consistently coming back for last 2-3 weeks to revert.  
My reply copied from his talk page: Forget him - Hello. I am talking to you after a long time. Forget him: . In case people find that one destructive, he/he shall be suitably dealt with by someone. I find that taking any action is of no use as our processes are not capable of dealing with such destructive edits, if any! Thanks.

You should realize that Wikipedia is bombarded daily by juvenile hoaxes and vandalism concerning pornography.

Or, if the source (the one claiming that the christian sources are unreliable) then it would be ok to drop the higher number and relegate the info to the religion sub-article.

 My signature and your actions ~  

I thought about taking this to a dispute hearing, but I couldn't be fucked.  So, I'm just going to outline here why I think that your blocking of my account was unjustified and against policy.  

You stated when you blocked me, """"anon. only, account creation blocked) with an expiry time of indefinite (personal attack in signature - will unblock on signature change"""" .  I disagree with your action on three levels.  The first is that it was a personal attack, the second on the indefinite ban, and the third on any action at all.  

 Why it wasn't a personal attack 
""""The primary purpose of creating any block is to protect Wikipedia and its editors and users from harm."""" (From WP:BP).  Of the list of reasons, on WP:BP the only one plausibly applicable is """"Disruption"""".  Under this it has 

""""A user may be blocked when his/her conduct severely disrupts the project — his/her conduct is inconsistent with a civil, collegial atmosphere and interferes with the process of editors working together harmoniously to create an encyclopedia.""""

And """"Blocks for general incivility are controversial"""".
In no way could any of my actions be considered """"severely"""" disruptive.  Or even simply disruptive.  While it could be argued that my signature was generally uncivil (and I disagree, more later), blocking for this reason is controversial and should have been discussed first.  So, from WP:BP there is no reason (in my opinion) to block.  

Now we examine WP:NPA.  This is simply, """"Do not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikipedia"""" and I agree with it.  The point here is """"personal"""".  My signature was not a personal attack on anyone.  It was a generalised comment and an """"in joke"""" (I can't help it if you are not in on the joke).  For the """"attack"""" to be personal, you would need to find someone who was """"attacked"""", you would not be able to do this.  

So, my signature did not constitute an attack on anyone, it did not disrupt discussion or affect the quality of my edits, thus it should not be a factor in anything.  

As to general incivility, I simply disagree.  From WP:CIVIL, """"Whereas incivility is roughly defined as personally targeted behavior that causes an atmosphere of greater conflict and stress"""".  My signature was not """"personally targeted behavior"""" (as explained above), and I also fail to see how it could cause an atmosphere of """"conflict"""" or """"stress"""".  There is nothing in this policy which is applicable in this case.

 Why I should not have been blocked 
In blocking me indefinitely, you violated WP:BP which states, 

""""Established users with significant constructive edits should not be indefinitely blocked except when there is a community ban. In all other cases, they should be handled with appropriate time-limited blocks or arbitration. Indefinite blocks should not usually be placed on IP users (whether individual IPs or IP ranges) in order to avoid inadvertently blocking legitimate users.""""

In blocking me at all, I also feel that you violated WP:BP.  You did not have a clear reason to block me, and you did so indefinitely.  In these cases, you should have posted at WP:ANI asking for advice and/or detailing why you felt that the block was needed.

 What could have happened 
So, what could you have done?  Well, the simplest thing would have to post on my talk page a comment asking me to change my signature and pointing to the policy which it violated (see the previous case for an example).  If you had have done this (and I had agreed with your argument) then I would have simply changed my signature.  If I had failed to change my signature, then you could have discussed it with me more, and/or taken it to a hearing.   

 Conclusion 
As I said at the beginning, I didn't want to take this to a hearing.  However, I feel that I would be perfectly within my rights to do so, and I reserve the right to do so.  This, by the way, is simply a statement.  

What would I like you to do?  Well, an apology would be nice, perhaps something worded along the lines of """"I'm sorry for not talking to you first, not checking policy and for violating policy by indefinitely blocking you"""".  

If you are unable to give an apology (for whatever reason, say you believe that you were in the right and still are), then I would appreciate a comment regardless.  

A comment on my userpage would be noticed faster, but here would be fine as well.

 BTW, XAL (or """"Sophie"""" or whomever you are), I usually don't read your rantings (I responded to your post above that ended with the sweet """"let's work together as a team"""" because it didn't sound like a rant), but this was pointed to me.

 In fact, I was blocked for 24 hours along with Igor by 315, for 3RR violation. but there is a difference:  I submitted to the block, I didn't go unregistered and find another IP to post anyway, but Igor did not submit to it.  he refused to abide by and posted to this talk page above """"Dear Marudubshinki...""""  This suggests that Igor believes he is above the rules.  the 3RR doesn't apply to him, does it?

 this reminds me of a time when i was a kid and we were saying """"table grace"""" before our meal.  my parents told us all that we had to be reverend, bow our heads, and close our eyes when we were praying our table prayer.  well, i left mine open and so did my much younger brother and when the prayer was over, he immediately tattled on me saying to our parents that """"Bob didn't close his eyes for the prayer.""""  geee, how did he know?

 well, it was Igor who made the complaint of the many reversions of mine and the admins decided (correctly) that he was reverting just as often as i was and the blocked us both.  but since the rules don't apply to Igor, he went and posted (using IP address for instead of logging in to his account) anyway.  it seems to me that the timing of this refusal to abide by his block was coincidental to when Snowspinner's tolerance for Igor's arrogance hit his/her limit and that's when the """"excrement"""" really hit the fan for Igor.   

?????rjb or whomever you are, I am the alone one ever in wiki on this case, both english and french who has posted with her full name and adress and telephon number and private emails, twice, and referes most of the time with both ip adress and real name, even before I had my own registration name on wiki, so suck your puppets! if cyber leaking make it possible you will soon get a 3D experience with Maharishi Maesh Yogi YBM dito Jean Perre Voyer dito leuven dito mister Rupley. {Replay!} supra transcendental levitations.....

Speedy deletion of Harry Elwell
 A tag has been placed on Harry Elwell requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia.

Qumar:deletion
This… I don’t know where to start!
In no particular order:-
.a)I found this had been deleted when it turned up on my watchlist,, though I never saw the discussion there; presumably because it was on another page, and this deletion looks like an afterthought.
.b) “decision was to merge with The West Wing # Foreign …""""
Well, actually it wasn’t.
3 voted for merging Equatorial Kundu and Qumar in a new page Fictional Countries in the West Wing;
2 voted for merge and re-direct to WW#F (3 if you count yourself)
2 others had no preference.
In the event you didn’t even do that; a search for Qumar leads to the top of the WW page, making it necessary to scroll through to find it.
.c) I find it hard to believe this would be agreeable to anyone who is interested in, or has contributed to, the WW pages; does that describe anyone who spoke on this decision? 
.d)The reason for the proposal isn’t that clear; “not notable”? So where does that leave all the other pages about fictional characters, places, histories?
.e)“can be re-created if sources are found to establish out-of-universe notability”; what does that mean? If it’s referred to in a book, like a commentary on the West Wing (though you don’t know, and haven’t checked, if there is one)? (for the record, there are at least 5 in the British Library Catalogue, and at least one in our town library; shall I check? Would it make any difference?
.f)“theres nothing on the page that isn’t said elsewhere""""; Well, there was quite a big page before (from memory), now there’s just a paragraph, so something has gone. And if information is in several places, what does it matter? It makes sense to repeat things/items/details from various places onto a single page to make the information more accessible; even real encyclopaedias can do that, the more so a virtual one.
.g) ) The page wasn’t (again, from memory) badly written, or un-encyclopaedic, especially compared to some of the pages I’ve seen; is WP so big that we can afford to be tearing decent pages out? (it’s still not as big or as comprehensive as a decent-sized city library).

 Issues on Banned IP 

Howdy,

My name's Mark and I'm typing from TransportSA, a state government agency here in Sunny (well, sort of sunny) South Australia.

Noticed that this IP has been banned due to vandalism, and if I could, would highly recommend that you contact Internode about this.  Internode has been around as an ISP here in SA for a very very long time, and has a reputation of """"doing the right thing"""".  Could I recommend you contact Simon Hackket at Simon@Internode.on.net .. He's the CEO of the business, and a very active and involved person.  It may be quite possible that he could initiate some action against the *actual* vandal if you are able to provide a clean time and date that the offending IP did it's work.  I *think* actions like this would be against the agreement made with Internode on fair use.

In any case, he's a great guy who just won't ignore the issue.

Hope this helps.

Well, yes and no... The Munida page on WoRMS shows two identical taxa listed under Munida, but doesn't explicitly say that they're the same as the ones listed as genera in Munididae.

Elelland

Hello Humus

I am sorry if I have placed this note in the wrong spot. I m very inexperienced with Wikipedia. I was enthralled by Wikipedia. Initially. That is until I met Eleland. I noticed that you had some interesting discussions with Eleland. Eleland engineered a small article which I contributed some information to be deleted. He organised a """"kangaroo court"""" made duplicitous unfounded claims and then set up a false consensus.

The Article was on Ed O'Loughlin Fairfax publishing MidEast correspondent. The said individual has a unfortunate habit of mixing reporting and commentary. He was amongst the candidates for this year's HR.com dishonest reporter award - despite being in the Australia only catchment area - so you can imagine the quality of his journalism.

Anyway Eleland did a great job of protecting him and got the article deleted.

So I studied Eleland a little.

I've looked at over 100 of his posts on the Arab Israel conflict. More than 95 were directly anti-Israel. His modus has been generally to unfairly rubbish the references of the pro-Israel side. In this way he has undermined many many articles.

Personally I don't care what his opinion is, but when he uses his editorial power and influence at Wikipedia to falsely invalidate, delete, manipulate etc. I think there is a problem.

Wikipedia is, I am afraid, beginning to read like Eleland wrote the script.

Who is Eleland? What power does he actually have?

Can anything be done?

I am not the founder, I am a contributor citing the founder's definition which I was able to find online, as the most appropriate definition of what the organization is. 

What you are suggesting is absurd. You are saying that it is not appropriate to inquire what the group is about directly from the creator instead relying on the opinion of someone else who clearly is opposed to what the group represents. 

Lets look at this from a more personal view. Do either of these argument examples seem resonable when applied to other topics?

Example 1. You are Jewish and tried to argue that; in a Wiki entry about """"Nazisim Beginnings"""", Hitlers definition of how the Nazi party got (perhaps extracted verbatim from Mein Kampf, would be less relevant than say Alan Dershowitz's thoughts on the topic extracted from an Op-Ed peice in the Times, because in your view, Hitler's definition seemed to one-sided and preachy.

Example 2. I am black and tried to argue that Louis Farrakhan would more neutrally write the """"Overview"""" entry for the """"Leakey Foundation"""" than the groups namesake Louis Leakey. The reason I give for this choice is that """"to use Leakey's comments on the subject, no matter how precise his summary, could only be a """"soapbox"""" for his opinion and agenda.

Does either example seem reasonable to you if you can access the source and get an unadulterated definition?

The entry I am including is very thorough, and includes highly important information such as founding members, date of origination, what they believe, what they don't believe, and anything someone researching the group would want to find out. You have a userbox for """"This user is opposed to online censorship."""" but that is clearly your intent here as you are simply removing relevant information under the thin argument of """"saving the world from a soapbox"""".

Scott A Brown, better known as spotteddogsdotorg on the Wikipedia because Scott A Brown wanted to make revenge on the evil spotteddogsdotorg who did not give Scott A Brown the WCAU as CBS tape which would have let Scott A Brown relive those good days so Scott A Brown made Wikipedia vandalism accounts to make the evil spotteddogsdotorg look evil on the Wikipedia. Scott A Brown stole stuff from the evil spotteddogsdotorg who did not give Scott A Brown the WCAU as CBS tape as promised website and put on Wikipedia and made it so any innocent Wikipedia person who crosses the evil  becomes a sockpuppet of the evil spotteddogsdotorg who did not give Scott A Brown the WCAU as CBS tape as promised. This will make innocent Wikipdedia people angry at Wikipeia and the evil  who is working evil plans at tvnewstalk.net with their evil pack of seven. Scott A Brown has several accounts at tvnewstalk.net waiting for the chance to reveal the evil there.

The Solution
Scott A Brown knows the evil spotteddogsdotorg who did not give Scott A Brown the WCAU as CBS tape will never give Scott A Brown the WCAU as CBS tape as promised. Scott A Brown wants full credit for the vandialism on the Wikipedia, the removal of the evil Roy Leep from the Wikipedia and the removal of the evil  from the Wikipedia. Then Scott A Brown will stop vandalizing the Wikipdeia. Scott A Brown requests as a good faith thing to make  a banned user of the Wikipedia forever. Scott A Brown also wants the evil CFIF to leave this on his Wikipedia talk page and put this on the evil tvnewstalk.net and tell this to the evil pack of seven who is working with the evil spotteddogsdotorg who did not give Scott A Brown his WCAU as CBS tape as promised and the evil Roy Leep.

 Irgendwer=Alfrem? 

After reviewing the archive of this talk page, I'm pretty sure Irgendwer is a sockpuppet of , who has already been banned from this article ArbCom for trying to remove the phrase """"political philosophy"""" from the lead.. Both are obviously less than fluent in English, appear to enjoy addressing others as """"troll,"""" and have a tendency to say """"kindergarten"""" when especially annoyed by opposition to their edits. I have filed a request for CheckUser here.  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

When people are losing arguments to maintain their majority POV, they may change to denunciation and enforced law. This is exactly the sense of libertarianism not to be political.  

Do you deny that you are Alfrem?  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

Alfrem is obvisously a dead account. So your question makes no sense. But it makes clearly sense that you are a troll.  

I'm asking if you are the same person who edited under the account Alfrem. Yes or no?  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

Well, well, well.  You're quite the detecive, rehpotsirhc!  This is from Alfrem's talk page:

====Alfrem banned from Libertarianism====
Enacted on 19:58, July 13, 2005 (UTC)  

 Pending resolution of this matter  is banned from editing of Libertarianism. It shall be presumed that any user, such as  who makes Alfrem's trademark edit, removal of the phrase """"Libertarianism is a political philosophy,"""" from the article is a sockpuppet of Alfrem. Such sockpuppets may be banned indefinitely if practical.

According to this, it seems like  should be banned indefinitely if practical...   

Are you the Great Dictator?  

No.  Just extraplating from what was said about you earlier.  And, by the way, there is nothing unlibertarian about banning someone from a libertarian community who cannot abide by the rules designed to protect everyone's rights within that community.   For example, being refused entrance to a tie-required restaurant - for lack of wearing a tie - is consistent with libertarianism.   

 about me? Denunciation! Not even your term of sockpuppet is correct. And, by the way, you describe Wikipedia as your property but it is used as political public good.  

When you can spare 5 free min. within your dictatorship, you may deliver about the old question:
What is your concrete evidence that libertarianism must be described in its characteristic feature as """"political""""?
 

What would be an example if such evidence, if it were possible? You've already dismissed appeals to logic, highlighting of the prima facie indefinsibility of your position, and links from across pretty much the entirety of Western civilization. You don't even understand half of what is said here. Do you want a photograph? A mathematical proof? You made up your mind along time ago and won't listen to any other opinions. Now, are you Alfrem or not?  █♣█ ▪ Talk 

Yes, I am convinced that Irgendwer is Alfrem. They are both German, and they use similar mannerisms such as referring to libertarianism as """"L."""", """"kindergarten"""", etc. They make similar grammatical errors.

75bb87c5a31e81db,"""Crown corporations ==
VIA Rail is a not a true Crown Corporation in that it cannot raise funds on the money market, rather it is subject to the whims of the government of the day for its ongoing funding. This is a major reason for the failure of VIA to improve its lot.

True enough regarding how political control limits the company's """"viability"""" (pun intended!), however the definition of a Crown corporation throughout Canada's history has been fairly broad.  In the sense that any publicly owned (ie. government) company in Canada is a Crown corporation, then VIA Rail would meet that criteria.  For many years prior to its recapitalization in the late 1970's and the Canadian railway industry's deregulation in the 1980's, CN was not allowed to raise funds either.  Provincial Crown corporations like B.C. Rail and B.C. Ferries or N.B. Power were similarly limited at certain points in their existence.  I could be wrong, as I have not read the VIA Rail Act in-depth but is there a specific provision which limits the company from seeking funds on the """"money market"""" in the way you describe?  I would also argue that there is likely no public transport company in the world which is financially successful in the limited way in which economists in the 20th/21st century measure this.  Since there is no accounting taken for the numbers of vehicles taken off a nation's highways each day, or having to construct new roads to isolated communities served by VIA/Amtrak/etc., or the environmental benefits realized, etc. etc. etc. then VIA Rail, Amtrak, Eurorail, various ferries, etc. will never be financially solvent.  Cheers,  22:00, 31 Jul 2004 (UTC)

The following section was added by User: Andrew Dunning and I have commented it out pending input from others due to several errors:

Officially, the move from the CP to CN line was to keep service to more remote communities on the CN line. However, this move was seen as somewhat more politically-motivated by some. Coincidentally, the CN route goes through more towns that voted Progressive Conservative. Harvey André, the Cabinet minister who represented Calgary in 1990, was fairly public about the fact that he did not care if he never saw a train again in his life. The CN line also went through Edmonton, the home of both Mulroney and Joe Clark.

No doubt politics played a heavy role in this 2nd round of VIA cuts, however I'm unsure as to what the actual political representation played throughout the Super Continental's route (historically, the Super was a CN transcontinental train, and The Canadian was a CP transcontinental train).  In the 1990 cuts when VIA was reduced to a single transcontinental, they decided to keep the more-recognized Canadian brand, and use it on the CN line... why the CN line is the question, however some have suggested CN being a crown corp at the time, gave VIA a better deal on trackage fees, insurance costs, etc. etc.  Politics could also have played a role, or perhaps the thinking was that VIA should be supporting the feds to provide service to the more remote northern prairie communities since the Trans-Canada Highway follows the southerly CP route and was already well-served by inter-city busses.  The main reason I've commented out the above addition was the last line concerning Clark & Mulroney's ridings - Clark represented High River near Calgary, Alberta in the 1980s and Mulroney represented Manicouagan near Baie Comeau, Quebec.  Harvey André...  I have no idea - very likely though.  Once this part gets edited/verified properly, it should appropriately be added to the story surrounding the 2nd round of cuts in 1990. 16:57, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Joe Clark was born and raised in High River, but he represented Yellowhead, a large riding between Edmonton and Jasper, from 1979 to 1993. Mulroney never lived in Alberta, nor was he ever an Alberta MP. 17:30, 4 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Yeah, this is definitely a mess.  Before I put some time in cleaning it up, would anyone like to weigh in as to whether they'd like to see this sort of information in this article?  For Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway we've resisted having the roster in the article, but VIA Rail might be different because (a) its locomotive count is in the dozens, not the thousands and (b) it's a bit easier to compile a complete roster since VIA's under 30 years old.

I agree with  that the mere status of being a soldier makes you a legitimate target. It seems that you  think its okay for Israel to capture and kill members of Hezbollah even though they are civilians but are still a legitimate target but that when Hezbollah captures two Israeli soldiers that they are not a legitimate target. In sum you claim, when Israel captures or kills civilian Lebanese who belong to Hezbollah they are killing or capturing a legitimate enemy target but when Hezbollah captures or kills Israeli soldiers they are not capturing or killing a legitimate enemy target.

 p values and the 0.05 standard 

Hi, I'm curious about the origins of the 0.05 p -value standard and didn't want to continue the discussion on the homeopathy talk page, so I hope you don't mind a question here.  I admittedly oversimplified my statement about 0.05 being arbitrary, mainly in an effort to save space and not overexert myself in addressing another editor.  Clearly, """"arbitrary"""" was not the best word, but what I'm curious about is the origins of two standard deviations being established as the cut off for significance.  Is there any inherent reason why two SDs are significant, or is it simply a convenient attribute of any distribution which can be used to define outlying data points?

I can cast some light on:

1. CZMarlin's contribution 

CZMarlin is a tireless promoter of AMC vehicles (he owns at least two and has a website dedicated to AMC products). As he knows, I have developed the view that he seems to use the project quite persistently as a PR medium for the defunct corporation and its products. It is, I believe, to this end that, it seems to me, he has habitually fought against sourced material that brings neutrality and balance to articles on AMC products, e.g. AMC Pacer, Gremlin etc.  

It is true that I was deeply frustrated by the apparent determination with which he misrepresented others’ contributions in order to justify their deletion, e.g. . I was also frustrated by his apparent insistence on idiosyncratic and erroneous interpretations of the English language, and also by what appeared to be deliberately erroneous interpretation of verifiable facts, e.g.   errors that cannot be permitted in an  encyclopedia.  

My sincere belief that English was not CZM’s first language arose from the manner in which he uses it and the difficulties of communicating with him. (Examples on request.) I disagree that I belittled him for it – as a non-native English speaker myself, it's not something I would do.  Indeed I offered to help him with the language (offer ignored) and told him he could seek help from WP volunteer translators, so that he could write in Polish (also ignored).  

True, I ridiculed him when his behaviour seemed so extreme as to appear ridiculous to me.  I should not have done so. But we get frustrated when we try to work with an editor who, it seems, demonstrates provocatively scant regard for factual accuracy, neutrality, balance and clarity of communication . Granted, I should not have let my frustration show. 

The 'known vandal' CZM mentions is in fact an IP address used by one or more people. The address had a history of vandalism. When I saw a constructive edit from it I tried to encourage the contributor in her/his constructive behaviour; and later suggested the sandbox for experiments:  , . My posts encouraged constructive behaviour. 

CZM's damaging claim that these posts encouraged disruptive behaviour is totally false. (This gives a flavour of the difficulties I had with him.) It also casts serious doubt on the reliability of his contribution here, and also on his good faith.

He implies that my use of the term 'AMC cuckoos' was insulting. Not so, as he well knows, because I explained it to him when he showed that he had misunderstood the idiom: I used the term in an edit summary to describe the long-winded and inappropriate descriptions of certain AMC cars that he had introduced  like cuckoos in a nest  into an article on a certain aspect of automotive aerodynamics .

My  'another sophomoric CZM error' was mischievous but (IMO) harmless retaliation for CZM’s previous sniffy dismissal of some Google research I had posted to a discussion, which he denigrated as 'sophomoric research'. He seems to have forgotten that.  

The reference to 'little fuhrer' is more serious, and I should not have used it even though it mentioned no names (so no harm done to CZM’s reputation). Why that particular metaphor? I’m afraid I regarded CZM’s approach to editing as uncollaborative and perfunctory to the point of being dictatorial; and ruthless in its uncritical promotion of AMC and its products.

2. Collect’s contribution 

Just as he could list my transgressions (""""I have a list of [Writegeist's] comments""""), so also could I recite a litany of his own. Meh. Tit for tat gets us nowhere.

However it is worth noting that an antagonism grew between us at the Sarah Palin pages when it became apparent to Collect that I disagreed with much of his input, whereas he had assumed from one of my earliest contributions there that I would be an ally (he left an appreciative note on my Talk).

 Górny & Rosiknoń Witnesses to Mystery: Investigations Into Christ’s Relics 

Several editors tried to prevent including material from that book, voicing an opinion of the authors that """"the results of numerous time-consuming and comprehensive analyses, conducted using the most technologically advanced equipment available, seemed to coincide with assertions prevalent in Christian tradition."""", under the pretext of RS. For discussion of the matter, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard#Is_a_book_by_a_journalist_and_a_photographer_a_reliable_source_for_an_analysis_of_religious_relics.3F 

Ignatius is a serious Catholic publisher, I don't know why books published by them should be excluded from Wikipedia -except someone's hostility to Catholicism. If we exclude Górny, then we should also exclude Carrol-Cruz -catholic writer as well, and Nickell, sceptical writer, who is much more biased (against any relics) than any Catholic source -so his book is not the sort of book that should be used to write a neutral article. The statement is an opinion cited, not a fact. Besides there is no such academic discipline as study of the relics yet -anyone can publish whatever wants. In the lead, we have two negative opinions, by Erasmus from 1500s, and by Thurston from 1913. So the lead is not neutral. To balance it, we have posititve Górny&Rosiko;ń opinion from 2013 -much more recent, after several researches on some relics (described in their book) have been published.

 Nice guy vs jerk 

Nice guys often come from a secular background, who are wrongly taught at home from an early age to respect the opposite sex and see her as equal in terms of intelligence and everything else. Jerks on the other hand come from semi-religious households (the extremes of abrahamic religions often) who by default see the opposite sex as inferior and in need of protection.

This makes sense when you think of the so called """"Girl-power"""". Girl-power is completely useless on a jerk, a girl cannot hurt a jerk's feeling with her words and gestures because he's simply not thinking about what she says, but instead if the girl was to attack the jerk physically then he would in fact respond to it very violently. 84.241.20.45  Goshtaasp""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Most of your edits are fine. Thank you for restoring previous edits in a non-POV way which I think is acceptable. Most of the article is fine. I will just question two points. First I am not sure what you have accomplished by suppressing the publishers' understanding of the Singapore Math method. You may disagree with them, but it is still valid in a Wikipedia article to report what the publisher believes about their own work. I actually agree with much of your evaluation, but in order to keep Wikipedia neutral, our opinions should not be used to decide what to report and what not to report. The publisher's own description of their books should be included in this article. Perhaps you could write it in a way that makes it more clear that this is the publisher's own (and perhaps biased) opinion?

Second, if you suppress the reason why the National Math Panel believes Singapore Math to be exemplary, you should delete the entire reference to this fact. You may disagree with the Math Panel's thinking, but the fact is that this (and Singapore's success on international tests) is the only reason Singapore Math was cited in their report. By deleting what the Math Panel said leaves the reader under the impression that the Math Panel reviewed Singapore Math (they did not) and are in agreement with all of the features of Singapore Math. Their precise statement was, """"The Singapore standards (Singapore Ministry of Education, 2006) provide an established example of curriculum standards designed to develop proficiency in a relatively small number of important mathematics topics, as validated by a recent analysis (Ginsburg et al., 2005).""""""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 I heard you like hamburgers. 

  The Hamburglar is a McDonaldland character who features in McDonald's commercials. He is a close friend of Ronald McDonald, Grimace, and Birdie. Even though he has always attempted (and failed) to hoard all the hamburgers in McDonaldland for himself, he has always been looked upon as a valued member of the McDonaldland community.

History
Despite a few changes made to his appearance over the years, he has always been endearingly loved by fans all over the world. A pint-sized burglar who first appeared in March 1971 and was one of the first villains on the commercials. He was dressed in a black-and-white hooped shirt and pants, a red cape, a wide-brimmed hat, and red gloves. His primary object of theft was hamburgers, hence his name. The character, like Grimace, started out as a villain, only he was old, had a long nose, gray hair, and was called the Lone Jogger in some 1970s commercials, sporting a shirt that said """"Lone Jogger"""". Hamburglar spoke in gibberish which was often translated by Captain Crook.

He was revised in 1985, when his look changed from a trollish old man to a red-head Dennis the Menace-type child who spoke and wore a shorter-brimmed hat and a black cape with yellow on the inside. His previously-unintelligible muttering was now the familiar """"robble robble."""" In """"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald,"""" he took on a new, sporty appearance wearing green goggles, a leather jacket, striped shirt, shorts and sneakers. He loved playing tricks on his friends and still loved burgers. The last appearances of Hamburglar on television were prime time commercials promoting the dollar menu. Hamburglar was voiced by Howard Morris in most commercials, Charlie Adler in some 1980s commercials and """"The Wacky Adventures of Ronald McDonald""""; and Carl W. Wolfe in some 1990s commercials.
Hamburglar 2015
In 2015, new images were released by McDonald's depicting the Hamburglar as a grown man wearing a fedora, a macintosh jacket atop a black-and-white t shirt, with black jeans and with high-top sneakers. He still has a mask, but his face now also sports a good half-inch of designer stubble. The character will be in commercials for the first time since 2002.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Okay, I just saw, what I guess is a camera phone capturing the second trailer. It's ultimate influenced again. Ultimate Venom. We see Peter talking to some older person—a chick, I think. Maybe Eddie's mom or something—about the suit and that """"it can take you over"""". Technically, the symbiote forming over Peter's suit, but only enough to change the color is a big hint. Topher's Eddie refers to himself as """"Edward Brock, Junior"""" as he goes into a church asking that Peter Parker be killed. He's really distrought and Topher plays it great. The phone capture guy moves his phone down. *belltower* Capture guy's phone is back up after seemingly missing the bondage and we see it...him...them. Venom, in all its massove glory. Compared to Eddie, it's huge. We can only assume he somehow gets more of the stuff on him than Parker to make up for the added mass just like before, I guess Peter's regular suit protected him from the symbiote's mutative qualities as well. It can be found a bit larger here: ]http://s79.photobucket.com/player_local.swf?file=http://vid79.photobucket.com/albums/j144/duende_verde/duende_comic-con2006_spidey3.flv&refURL;=http://photobucket.com/&ap;=1]

I recently had to upgrade my Internet browser from Microsft Internet Explorer version 5 to Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5! I was having trouble as certian websites would not view correctly in Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5. Many of my favorite websites came out too distorted to even use correctly so I am very grateful that Microsft supports up to Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5 on Microsoft Windows 95 as I will never upgrade my operating system! Microsoft Internet Explorer version 5.5 works much better and for that I am truly grateful! People must understand that Packard Bell computers are the best around, no questions asked! I plan to continue running my Packard Bell Legend 140CDT Supreme until either I die or my computer dies, wichever comes first.

8ba573592c203eaa,"Wow...you hold a masters degree in economics and have taken many doctoral courses? Is that supposed to impress us? Most professional economists are on the payroll of the FED, so of course they reject Austrian economics. AE is, however, the oldest continual school of economic thought. Moreover, it doesn't have the dismal track record of mainstream economics, which, to quote Bill Maher, is a litany of getting shit dead wrong. From the Wall Street crash 1929, to the non-existent depression of 1946, to the Bretton Woods system, the stagflation of the 1970s, the S&L; crisis of the 1980s, the dot.com bubble of the 1990s and the housing bubble of the 2000s. From Keynes' suggestion to bury FED-notes in glass jars underground and let people dig them up, to Samuelson's insistence on the USSR overtaking the US from the early 1970s to 1989, to Krugman's Space Alien Invasion solution to our present day crisis.
Just to name a few examples of the top of my head. With a track record like that, of course they will shun the one school of thought that get things right, that understand what economics actually is and, more importantly, what it isn't.
It's not the mainstream economists that don't take AE seriously, it's the other way around. For good reason. So excuse me for not being all giggly about your supposed training in economics. Like Jefferson said, you'd be better informed of current events if you didn't read any newspaper at all than if you read those of his day.

Your closure of that ANI report is unwise at best, abusive at worst. Ample evidence of wrong doing has been provided, maybe not with respect to the BI sanction (but even that is not clear cut, given it is meant to be broadly construed), but definitely in the sense that these edits are clearly the same terminology policing behaviour that led to that sanction, but on a slightly different BI related term. Action is clearly warranted. Archived or not, as I said, I am not going to let this lie, I will be informing Cailil when he returns. In addition to sanctioning Highking, I expect he will want to take issue with you disrespecting him by completely ignoring all the effort he went to in detailing exactly what is wrong with HighKing's behaviour, and what he should be avoiding. Who I am is completely and utterly irrelevant to whether or not HighKing is ignoring those warnings and engaging in the beahviour Cailil described as being not wanted here. He even made that exact point to HighKing - while Cailil has sympathy with the so called harassment he often claims to be suffering as a way of avoiding sanctions for making these edits, Cailil was crystal clear on the point that who reports him, or even just the mere presence of suspect accounts in any of these reports/disputes, has absolutely no bearing on whether or not he will act on any poor behaviour he observes from HighKing. I know he has previously expressed frustration at seemingly being the only admin here who is prepared to deal with HighKing, and I can see why with actions like this. Your closure of the section simply because of who the complainents are has only one effect - rewarding HighKing for bad edits. It's really no skin off my nose, is it? If I am a banned user, do you think archiving that discussion will have any effect on me? Or if I am not banned but this is just not my main account, then do you think archiving the section is going to change whatever reason I might have for not posting there with my main account? Of course not. The only thing it achieves is to remove from sight as an immediate issue. Which, given the fact Cailil was at pains to point out that HighKing's poor behaviour stretches back to 2008, is not a good thing for Wikipedia. You're an admin. You're expected to deal with long term problems, not sweep them under the carpet for wholly irrelevant reasons. If HighKing were ever to end up at arbitration for example, do you think he would escape sanction for persistent WP:TE behaviour, simply because other people involved were not following some completely unrelated rule like WP:SOCK? Of course not. Hopefully you can at least appreciate that as an admin, you being the person who maintains that cycle of WP:TE, is not only bad for Wikipedia, it's a form of laxity that really isn't excused by who I may or may not be. It also had the material effect of me not being able to correct Murray on a basic point of fact, meaning the archive now has errors in it, which I am sure is not the intent of that facility. Archive or no archive, at the very least, if, or more likely when, Cailil sanctions HighKing for those edits, I expect you to hold your hands up and admit your failure to do your duty as an admin in this case.

812224c52ab3fe94,"""A real problem has developed with the references, also Figure 1 has moved oddly and I can't get it back in place ==

To: Chzz
From: Howard Zimmerman

Chzz,

I had just figured out how to deal with References 4 and 5 and got them reasonably set up (at least to start).

But on looking at the article now, I see that the references are somehow in trouble and mixed up.

Another problem somehow developed. The drawing for Figure 1 is oddly placed.
I've attemted to give it more space, but the space is put partially before the caption
and the drawing doesn't move left but is oddly to the right.

Chzz, I appreciate your wanting to help. Especially in view of my uncertainty earlier about the referencing.

But is it possible to get the Article back to where it was this morning. I had just fixed up References 4 and 5.
I realize that I could improve them further but the basic job really was ok.

I think I can put the rest of the references in all right.

But I don't know if the article as it waa this morning is archived and can be retrieved.

If not, I can go through the article and see if I can get the right referencing. 

I haven't figured out exactly what went wrong. 

But Reference 3 should be to Krapcho and Bothner-By

Then Ref 4 should be to the 1961 Tetrahedron article

and Ref 5 to the Interscience 1973 article.

After that Ref 6 should be the Birch and Nasipuri 1959 article.

Chzz, if needed I can go through and experiment with fixing this up.

But I'm a bit uncertain about how to change the referencing although I can try.

AND, I don't know how to move the Drawing in Figure 1 to be to the left and centered.
while it was ok originally, my attempts to move it back haven't worked.

Thus if the article has been archived and can be gotten back, that would be simplest.

Chzz, it does appear that I've been the source of too much work for you. Neverheless
please do realize that I appreciate the help.

Best wishes,

Howard

Howard E. Zimmerman   —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Nothing is ever lost; the history shows all the previous versions, and all edits, back from when a page was made - see WP:HISTORY, and look at the page history.

I have tried to fix the refs from your description above - hopefully it is a bit better now; it's probably still not right, but considering most of it is correct, it might be easier to work from that. If you would rather just go back to the version before I edited it today though, that's easy enough, as explained above - or, let me know, and I'll put it back for you. Possibly it is easier to fix the existing, and refer back to this version.

Re. the figure, well, this is the problem I've been trying to describe. If you leave a number of blank lines to space the figures, then it might look OK to you, but it won't on another persons browser. You cannot rely on the text being the same size on their system, nor can you expect everyone to use a screen with the same resolution. This is a problem, with inserting images directly, rather than using the thumbnail system.  ►  

Two more things, to make our lives easier;

Please fix your signature, so it stops doing this 'unsigned comments' thing. To do that, click on 'my preferences', clear anything in the """"Signature:"""" box, and make sure that the checkbox """" Sign my name exactly as shown"""" is not checked.

When you make sections here (to leave messages), could you keep the title short? The long titles make it a bit unwieldy in the table of contents etc.

Neither are a huge problem; just trying to make things easier. Hope to hear more soon. [[User talk:Chzz|",0,0,0,0,0,0

Wikipedia: Plagiarism states that

""""Plagiarism is the incorporation of someone else's work without providing adequate credit. While the terms are often confused, plagiarism and copyright infringement are not the same thing. Copyright infringement occurs when copyrighted content is used without permission in a way that violates the copyright holder's exclusive right; adequate credit does not efface infringement. Similarly, public domain content is plagiarized if used without acknowledging the source, even though there is no copyright issue. This guideline addresses when copying and close paraphrasing may not be a problem, how to avoid plagiarism when there is a risk, and how to address it when it is encountered."""" (citation)

Wikipedia copyright issues stats that

""""However, material copied from sources that are not public domain or compatibly licensed without the permission of the copyright holder (unless brief quotation used in accordance with non-free content policy and guideline) is likely to be a copyright violation. Even inserting text copied with some changes can be a copyright violation if there's substantial linguistic similarity in creative language or structure(this can also raise problems of plagiarism). Such a situation should be treated seriously, as copyright violations not only harm Wikipedia's redistributability, but also create legal issues."""" (citation)

Both is not given. Just because there are concerning article passage doens't mean that they fall under such a categorie. I heard more times that plagiarism and Copyright violation are very serious issues. If they are so serious then why in years of existence of the article, has been never such an accusation there?

""""I don't think this is a controversial statement at all"""". I do not think it is controversial either. And besides, I don't care. Many facts or widespread intepretations are included in wikipedia that can be called controversial. The problem with this statement is that it is unconventional. It is also a POV but the POV or not discussion will become relevant when we establish at least some acceptance of this interpretation among academics. The rest here is your own speculations.

 And, if you want to describe him as a neo-conservative, you can do so without using that ambiguous term.  Isn't it more exacting instead to discuss Levin's support of military action in countries like Iraq. 

 I've yet to see any sourcing (or recall hearing) where he's advocated action against Iran, so expect me to scrub that assumption soon unless someone can provide a source.  Sure, he's criticized Obama for wanting to meet with Iran, but does anyone actually recall him advocating military action?

 Vandalism on B-theory of time 

It seems perhaps I have been going about this the wrong way, so I will try to be helpful and explain WHY your last edit was vandalism.

First off, the description intro, the quality of the intro had been greatly increased, Naming McTaggart as the founder is just repeating was is in the origin section, hence there is no need for it. The description gave a better just of what B-thoery of time is a whole. Undoing this completely is therefore vandalism, ESPECIALLY if you don'y first talk about it in the talk page before editing.

Secondly, you removed 'description', you then deleted the description as in metaphysics, changed the better, updated version of the physics part, then moved it in the origin section. There really is nothing I can say about this, I have no idea what kind of twisted reasoning could be behind that move?!....

Thirdly you removed this section: It is noted by Dean Zimmerman in 'Presentism and the Space-Time Manifold' that A-theory is 'almost certainly a minority view among philosophers', while B-theory has 'achieved broad acceptance'.http://fas-philosophy.rutgers.edu/zimmerman/Presentism%20and%20Rel.for.Web.2.pdf
It seems you perhaps have a personal agenda, favouring A-theory therefore editing in favour of it, this is not allowed on wikipedia, and it is vital to keep a Neutral point of view. The above statement however, is correct and cannot be removed simply because you do not want people to see it.

Finally, and on the most relevant side, you Craig information, it is an improvement that you have put the Craig talk in an oppose section as opposed to to the description section.
However a lot of it is not quoted, rather you have stated the opposition as out right fact. Such as...

""""The B-Theory suffers the same incoherence as all theories that time is illusory, namely, that an illusion or appearance of becoming involves becoming, so that becoming cannot be mere illusion or appearance. The Buddhist can consistently deny the reality of the physical world, since the illusion of physicality does not entail physicality, but this is not the case with temporal becoming."""" You stated this outright. This is an OPINION of Craig's it should be demonstrated as such, I also do not believe it belongs on the page and it is an obvious dig at another religion. 
In fact you have stated all of Craig's OPINIONS as fact.

If you want to make edits, please first discuss them in the talk page, and we can talk about whether it is relevant or not, and how it should be worded.

Sorry, I'm not.

In the 20th century it was brought back to life by the British, and thus became recognized world wide as """"Palestine"""". In any case, the Philistines themselves were not present yet in the land in the year 4,000 BC - they arrived around the time of the Israelites/Jews, and they settled mostly in a relatively small strip along the coast, an area which is partly the Gaza strip.

I have tried to give the article some balance. Bacque was actually an accomplished writer in Canada before Other Losses, but it is important to point out Other Losses was his first foray into history.
I think it's important to point out Bacque is talking about losses among German POWs held by the Western Allies. Certainly hundreds of thousands, and perhaps more that a million, German POWs died in Allied custody if the Soviet Union is included among the Allies. As well, tens of thousands of German civilians died in Soviet forced-labour crews.
Bacque does make a contribution, albeit flawed, to the historiography, one that has been built upon recently by Anthony Beevor and others, who have looked at the immediate post-war period, the state of Europe before the Marshall Plan, the European reconstruction period, the founding of the ECSC and the beginning of the Cold War.
I am not familiar enough with Bacque's books, especially the second one, to accurately describe them. I think someone who has read them carefully should, at least, give a bare outline of his argument before rejecting them out of hand.
I don't know why Holocaust deniers would embrace Bacque's work, since any neglect of Germans held as POWs by the Western allies does not negate the genocide against the Jews and other Nazi victims.

 Price of oil 

Bogorm, you really need to discuss your changes on the talk page.  You are making some fundamental editing errors which would need to be cleaned up sooner or later, and the fact that you keep reverting to your version is getting disruptive.  Also, please try to find sources other than Presstv.ir, as they have a conflict of interest in this subject and thus may not be the most trustworthy of sources.  If other sources are saying the same thing it is much more persuasive to the readers of this article.    
 I am not interested in American stance towards the PressTV and I urge you not to remove the source. If your obstinacy towards removing """"numerous"""" and """"augmented"""" is inexorable, I should """"die Flinte ins Korn werfen"""", as the Germans say, and laissez-faire... . But I assure you I am habitually not so amenable as in this matter. Besides, it's the above mentioned POV towards PressTV that I find disruptive. But methinks Wikipedia is more than copying from sources and if the Iranian which wrote the artcle, preferred to express himself about augmenting in Simple English, that does not interdict us from rendering his words in a more elaborate manner, does it??? And this is not the Wikipedia in Simple English, is it? Ah, one more thing - as most speculators are not Iranians, methinks it's beyond the """"La Manche"""" that most conflicts of interest are engendered...   

Have you at any time used any other user name
Your style of editing is not that of someone who has just started editing Wikipedia. Have you at any time used any other user name?   
 No, I have not. But I acquired experience while editing in the Bulgarian Wikipedia and Bogorm is since approximately one month the global name for all other language-editions of Wikipedia, where I am active, it is not only the bg Wikipedia.   

Then I suggest that you read Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Macedonia#Final decision (Balkans warring).   
 Why am I referred to it? Have I edited any article on the English Wikipedia related to Macedonia? Because in the immediate past I am not able to recollect such edit of mine...   

Because it refers to Balkans article in general see Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Macedonia#Area of conflict.

dd6e9f4dd38685dd,"""Forgetting about the in-depth meaning of the verse 34 in Islam==
From: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An-Nisa,_34
In the Qur'an, verse 34 of Surah an-Nisa (abbreviated as 4:34) concerns the issue of marital relations in Islam. This verse is interpreted by some Muslims as giving women a degree of autonomy over their own income and property but obliging them to comply with the husband's wishes should they be congruent with Islamic principles and beneficial to the marriage. The verse is also interpreted to mean that men are also obliged to be responsible for maintenance of their female relatives.[1]

There are a number of translations of this verse from the Arabic original, and all vary to some extent. [2]Some Muslims, such as Islamic feminist groups, argue that Muslim men use the text as an excuse for domestic violence.[3] However, some have translated """"beat"""" as """"separate"""", as Arabic in its nature is a multi-meaning language, and as such no word has a fixed sole meaning.[4]

Ibn Abbas, a companion of Muhammad, wrote the earliest commentary on the Quran, and to this part he himself said this is only a light tap.[5] When asked about the light hitting, he said it refers to using a siwak (toothbrush). There are sources that say that Muhammad himself never hit a woman and forbade it.[6] Furthermore, Muhammad commented on this verse, where he said “a light tap that leaves no mark.”[7]

Whenever you see brackets that means that the editor has added an explanation.  In this case [organic remains] was added to explain the word 'they'.  While W&M; used the word fossil in the previous sentence it is clear that they were referring to organic remains because by definition, recently buried remains (such as what is """"now occurring"""") are not fossils.  From the """"Dictionary of Geologic Terms"""", 3rd edition, 1984, by Bates and Johnson:  FOSSIL:  Any remains, trace, or imprint of a plant or animal that has been preserved in the earth's crust since some past geologic or prehistoric time.  Nothing buried in the present can be a fossil, for it is in historic time.  And further, you do not quickly bury fossils to preserve them, you quickly bury organic remains to protected them long enough so they they can eventually become fossils in some future geologic era.

W&M; likely used the term fossil loosely, like many editors of this WP page, to refer to organic remains that might become fossils per definition in some geologic era in the future.  It is unfortunate that W&M; were not as precise as they might have been, because uninformed people, such as Talk.Origins, misunderstand and twist what they said.

As much impact as W&M; have had on Creationary thought, nearly all fellow creationist today recognize that The Genesis Flood, is now way out of date.

 Ownership of this article 

My apologies for trying to edit your article, HelenOnline.  I didn't realise that this was your article.  I will not edit it again.  

I saw that the article had not been updated with the important closing arguments so I thought to update it.  I guess I should have realised that you owned it, by the way that you reverted everything, with a nasty message to my talk page on top of the reversion, sure signs of ownership.  I took it on face value that really all you wanted were references, as you complained so bitterly about my daring to add in things that you claimed were false.  I mean, you couldn't possibly be trying to damage my reputation just so that you could continue to own the page, could you?

I have no problem with a page being owned, HelenOnline, but I really think that at the top of the page it should say """"This article written by ....."""" and then it should say your real name.  Then people reading this can account for your biases.  And then, if, let's say, Oscar Pistorius, or Barry Roux, or Gerrie Nel, or someone else, think that what you have added is false, and want to sue you for publishing inaccurate information, then they will know to sue you, HelenOnline, rather than poor old Wikipedia.

I saw that you added a lot of false information to this article, HelenOnline.  Furthermore, I see that you deleted a lot of accurate information, while pretending that it was false.  Most dangerously, you used citations then misquoted what they said.  Very dangerous, that.

As I had said above, I really think that it is safer for you, HelenOnline, to recuse yourself from this article.  You have had major fights with several editors here, which has resulted, in your words, with you """"scaring them off"""", as you put it.  

I don't know precisely what happened with them, as all I can see are their comments in the talk page above, and looking through the history, but if it anything similar to the abuse I was subjected to, both from you, and by people who blindly support you without bothering to check facts, then I am sure that it was serious.  I got banned for 3 whole days for personal attacks, for asking you to recuse yourself!  Wow!  Just wow!  And as a result, you get to revert my edits unopposed, you get to abuse me all over Wikipedia, I get banned and on top of that the article gets locked in a false state, so that the truth will never be told.

It's on your head, HelenOnline, and everyone who supports you.  This article belongs to you, and if someone decides to sue you, on the completion of the trial on 11 September, I for one won't be held responsible for your false edits.

OK let's agree on one thing first: Including a link, not matter what the article is, requires substantial evidence in order to reason doing so. Having that in mind Planet Spore qualifies. BUT as we all agree (hopefully), WP is not a place to include every single website that may have info on a subject. (*)So we have to choose which are clearly ahead, in matter of info size, directory structure, further linking yada yada yada yada. For that matter WikiStylee you tried to justify the inclusion of  gamingsteve.com and I agree, xspore.com where I also agree and sporewiki.com where I don't agree - not the inclusion but your justification. You asked for a logical fallacy and there you have it. You justify the inclusion of sporewiki.com in the Ext.Links because... it is already linked by WP. You have fallen into a logical loop there I'm afraid. To correct you to go * and see why sporewiki.com deserves an inclusion. I have 0 problems with Planet Spore being excluded but I have tons of problems with anyone who naively tries to belittle one's efforts as clutter and WP-relatedly with anyone who (unjustifiably then, hopefully not now) tried to scare away others who wished for the inclusion with the method of """"WHATEVER YOU DO IT WILL BE REVERTED"""". I find THAT hideous and ugly because for the moment I care mostly for what WP provides, not GamingSteve.com or Planet Spore.com or whatever. So, that's all folks.

Structural geology is the study of structures (folds, faults, etc) within the rocks at scales varying from microscopic to continental. Now of course they are interrelated. Essentially, landforms are the product of erosive processes on the existing structure of the rocks involved and cannot be understood or explained without a good understanding of the geologic structure of the rocks. A geologist trying to decipher the structural geology of a region begins by studying the clues in the landforms. All is related. Now, there is a tendency of some geographers to think that geomorphology is a subdivision of geography and try to explain landforms without a thorough understanding of the structure, petrology, and stratigraphy on which the surface landforms develop. Landforms cannot be understood without knowledge of the geology on which they are formed.
Now, after all that, both articles are in need of improvement - as are most Wiki articles. So - someday someone will work 'em over (hopefully for improvement) and maybe I will (just don't hold your breath -)

GA review process

Well, the review process was instructive, as were the comments regarding how to improve the article. I had no idea that it was wrong to approach individual editors to comment (as I explained above it was to """"get the ball rolling"""" – naivety on my part, I'm afraid). I also think that Pyrotec's choice of language here (""""This review looks very much like a """"favour"""" being granted to the article's nominator by a co-conspirator"""") is very regrettable – perhaps he would like to retract it, look again at the six editors I asked to review the article (I chose a cross-section of editors experienced in CC pages but who had not made a contribution here – also explained above), and admit that he jumped to conclusions. Another example of why good faith is so important. Anyway in future, I'll just make a general post on the talk page about GA nominations. 
From the comments re: the article itself it's clear that the article needs work in certain areas. Specifically:
MOS issues, esp. with regard to the synopsis
Restructuring of criticism section and dealing with """"stubby paragraphs""""
Consistency in spelling 
Overlong sentences in synopsis (although Guetterda's criticism """"the synopsis is written in a narrative form - x happened, then the author introduced y, then z happened - which is inappropriate for the synopsis of a book of this form"""" may be misplaced as the book is a chronological account of this subject) 
Delingpole's review quoted in the lead but not the main body
 Further critical review needed/possible problems with tone
 Needs more images

That should be enough to be getting along with)) I don't regard the rejection as a setback, but merely a blip on the road to getting The Real Global Warming Disaster to GA status one day, in strict compliance with WP guidelines, though I still have reservations about how wise it was to choose a book from this subject area.

Challenging suspected socks non-stop is sometimes considered uncivil and may seem like a personal attack without confirmation.

The more viewers I get, will support my case in the court of public opinion and pressure the three involved companies, Chrysler, Compuware d/b/a Professional Services, and Combustion Components to settle my 11 year homelessness.

Search: Corporate Blacklisted engineer

   

I worked as a Mechanical Design Engineer for almost 20 years collectively for the following companies; Pratt and Whitney, Williams International, Ford Motor Company, and as a contract engineer for Compuware d/b/a Professional Services at Chrysler Corporation in Auburn Hills, Mi. It is the latter two to which I am forging my complaint as they told prospective employers, my private investigator and my newspaper reporter, that I was not employed by them, thus blacklisting me, and preventing from all future employment.

 

I believe that they did this to me because I found fault with one of Chrysler’s automotive designs that could have resulted in a safety issue, that they did not want to fix and it was easier and cheaper to get rid of me.

 

I took my case all the way to the Supreme Court in Washington, DC and in Boston’s Federal court ….all courts denied me justice. A lawyer representing Chrysler offered me $1000 to settle the case about 2 years ago which I refused since I felt it was like a slap in the face compared to the injustice they have caused me.

 

Your viewing of my video will greatly help to end my 11 yrs of homelessness by increasing public awareness of my case and consequently, will send Chrysler, Compuware and combustion components a direct message that I am not giving up and refuse to go quietly into the night.

 

Thank you for your time and consideration,

I have reverted your edits to these two articles. Please review WP:V to learn about appropriate, reliable sources for the information you keep adding, and also visit WP:LIBEL and WP:BLP to learn about appropriate information in biographical articles of living people. Insinuating that these two individuals are having an affair or are anything other than faithful to their respective significant others is libelous, and against Wikipedia policy. You have not provided a reliable source to support the POV suggested by your edits. WP:NPOV will help you learn about Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.

The quotes you have added are taken out of contexttheir mentions of a """"crush"""" on each other were done in a joking manner, and another cast member followed their comments by saying she had a crush on both of thembut that's not grounds for speculating that the cast member in question is having an affair with both of them, and if I said or insinuated that she were, that would be libel. These quotes are cast members speaking highly of each other, and frankly, good public relations by supporting their on-screen chemistry and by extension, that of the fictional characters they play. Many other cast members have complimented their co-stars, including PD and EP, but no reliable source has, to my knowledge, ever published information that these two (or any other cast members) were anything other than co-stars who happen to be friends. On the contrary, both speak frequently of their significant others in high esteem (in print and on camera), and speak well of each other's partners. There's also a question of whether such compliments are even relevant in the grand scheme of the article, but that's a moot point because your edits are unsourced, and against the WP:LIBEL policy.

 hello 

I don't know what you have against me.  I suppose it is easy to be cold and harsh over a keyboard/monitor.  I never wanted anything but cultural fairness on these pages and compromise.  The aggressiveness and one sided-ness of people like Gryffindor and noclador has always been offensive to me, what can I say?  At least some of you German speakers have to realize that by moving the Province of Bolzano-Bozen to just South Tyrol on English Wikipedia is just emphasizing a German point of view, and only a German point of view.  You really can not say that South Tyrol is the major English usage.  It just isn't.  Alto Adige is also used very often, in the Unites States, almost entirely.  The name of the page itself is taken from Brittanica.  Even on the Bolzano provincial website, one of the English documents says Province of Bolzano.  Look, you guys can do anything you want.  If you change it to South Tyrol, I hope it really makes all of you finally happy with your lives.  I actually feel very sorry to see people in Europe still get so deeply ingrained in these ethnic politics.  The attitude and aggressive behavior I see coming from German speakers, especially German speakers in BZ reminds me more of what you see in Yugoslavia.  It really isn't that far from the """"we are victims"""" attitude before the World Wars. I'm sorry if that is being blunt...""",0,0,0,0,0,0
7c3e0a4cee62a295,"Yes, being paid alters judgement. So does joining Scientology, believing in Astrology, being against gun control, being for gun control, or any number of other reasons for advocacy editing. I could make a case for Wikipedia being harmed more by religious or political advocacy editing than by paid advocacy editing (but see below for why I think this might change).
There are however, a couple of things that are special about paid advocacy editing which IMO require extra care.
First, Scientology cannot do anything to suddenly have ten times more followers. They are already doing the best they can and the pool of potential converts is resistant.
Paid advocacy editing, on the other hand, can easily gain as many paid advocacy editors as desired by simply paying more. Think of the difference between getting emails advocating politics or religion vs. emails about online pharmacies. The first is annoying, but self limiting; the second gets bigger and bigger as long as it remains profitable. Our article on Email spam gives numbers like 200 billion spam messages sent per day and 97% of all emails being unwanted. I think Jimbo is right to be especially concerned over something that could grow exponentially.
Second, we really cannot do anything to convince most religion or politics advocates to change their ways other than blocking or banning them, but we can make big changes in how paid advocacy editors operate. If it becomes well known that the advocacy editors who don't edit articles directly but instead make talk page requests get better results and that the sneaky kind of paid advocacy editor usually gets reverted, the customers will naturally go with the service that gets the best results. We can make that happen, but again it takes special care.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Re Qazakh
Dear Khoikhoi, thanks for your mediation effort on this one. I agree to the general spirit of text you posted. But I would like to hightlight some corrections/additions, which I highlighted in bold below:
1. Under the Russian Empire, the rayon was an north-eastern part of the Kazakh uyezd of the Elisavetpol guberniya.
2. User:Aivazovsky needs to cite the references where he got the figures 39% Armenians and 57% Azerbaijanis from.
3. This sentence does not reflect the historical reality:
""""After the British left and more fighting between Armenians and Azeris ensued, Bolshevik forces gained control of the region and annexed it to the Soviet Union""""
Britons have left Caucasus in 1919, while Bolsheviks took over Azerbaijan (first in Caucasus) on April 28, 1920, Armenia was taken by Bolsheviks in November 1920. Soviet Union was created in 1922. So obviously Bosheviks could not have annexed it to the Soviet Union. Kazakh uyezd was part of Azerbaijan (Elisavetpol governorate was designated so by Britons), which under Bolshevik rule was divided between Armenia and Azerbaijan.
4. """"Neither country has disputed this boundary since"""" quote is not true. Armenia occupied one of the exclaves of Kazakh rayon, called Yuxari Askipara during 1991-1994 active phase of war.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Few clarifications 

Hi Nichalp,

I am busy doing the changes you suggested. Meanwhile, I have a few doubts and would be happy if you can resolve them.

First of all, what is the difference between GFDL(GNU Free Documentation License) and PD(Public Domain). I have already seen the articles on them without any success in understanding the difference. Aren't GFDL documents open to public use? All the images created by me are tagged , but I don't have any idea if  would be more appropriate or not.

Secondly, I couldn't understand the context of your saying """"IITB also has a geology department. Please check."""" Even if it does have one, where should the changed be made, if at all they are to be done since this is a very minor issue.

Thirdly, I would be happy if you can suggest some neutral title to """"Success story"""". Few of my attempts have been reverted by other authors as they felt the titles suggested by me are inappropriate. Even I feel so, but I have no clue what would be most appropriate.

Thanks,

But we have to consider the fact that these research reviews each looked at a different corpus, which isn't clear in the current version. Here is what Cochrane 2006 says:
 """"Inclusion criteria: Adults with a primary diagnosis of anxiety disorder (or corresponding to another diagnostic criteria including Diagnostic and Statistical ofMental disorders (DSM), International Classification of Disease -9(ICD-9) or ICD-10 clinical descriptions or research diagnostic criteria for neurotic disorders) with or without another comorbid psychiatric conditions, irrespective of gender, age, race or nationality.""""
The authors' criterion for inclusion was that the individuals in the study have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. They were psychiatric patients. That's why they excluded for consideration 46 of the 50 studies on anxiety that they found. They only wanted those studies on adults with a specific diagnosis: """"Using the diagnostic criteria for psychiatric disorder (DSM or ICD classification) and limited to include only Randomised Controlled Trials, 46 studies were excluded from the early phase."""" Of the four studies that remained, one was on TM. Cochrane looked at a single study on TM.

Eppley looked at every study on TM that related to anxiety. Most of these were nonclinical studies, that is, they included subjects that hadn't been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. These studies, both meditation and relaxation, most commonly used the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, a standardized assessment of anxiety levels that's been validated in hundreds of studies, to assess the level of anxiety in the subjects. His meta-analysis included 35 studies on TM. In sum, the best way to represent these sources is to make it clear that they were looking at different populations of subjects, and hence, different groups of studies.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Heah, 

Thanks for your reply.  First, I wrongly assumed that Jossi had started the deletions.  He just joined in and was the one who reported me for reverting.  I didn't know that there was an edit log that tracked all activity but someone showed me afterward.  I still maintain, however, that these deletions were indeed acts of vandalism.  They weren't corroborative edits, that's for sure.  They were, as I said, wholesale, repeated deletions of original text.  You speculate that the problem might have been my lack of citations but, in this case, I can assure you that's not the problem.  Jossi's full aware of the fact that both Geaves' comments and Rawat's own contradictory words (in his letter inviting his followers to the Millenium festival) are proven and accurate.  Here's a link to the Geaves' article:

Footnote 5 is the one where Geaves' relieves Rawat of any knowledge or responsibility for the Millenium hype.

And here's a link to the letter Rawat himself wrote which clearly puts the lie to Geaves' revisionism:

The Wiki rule about vandalism states that most is dealt with by fast reversions.  However, it doesn't say that persistent efforts in this regard may nonetheless violate the three-reversion rule and trigger blocking!  It does seem a little Kafak-esque, don't you think?

Finally, on the more general complaint I have about Jossi Fresco, I do invite you to take some time, if you would, and review his editing of the Rawat articles.  He is a paid web guy for a person who is most certainly a cult leader, a man who still has many, many followers who believe that he is God in human form.  Jossi is adept at using Wikipedia to ensure that the articles never truly capture the story of the man.  The fact that he's a Wikipedia administrator is worrying, in my opinion.  18:13",0,0,0,0,0,0

 I followed the links to an article on """"consensus decision making"""". The entire article seemed to me to be on the simplistic side (perhaps due to my ongoing research in Organizational Communication), but it had a section on """"Quaker decision making."""" I don't know if it would be appropriate to link back here (sort of a 360 degree thing), but it certainly is relevant. 

 Perhaps an article on """"Quaker meetings"""" might be worth considering? I'm thinking in terms of examining several types of Quaker meetings (clearness, weddings, threshing, as well as business) in light of Quaker philosophies or traditional practices. Put another way, I am growing increasingly sensitive to cataloging """"weird Quaker ways of doing things"""" in a de-contextualized sense. Perhaps we would be better off discussing how the Quakers' beliefs led to these different ways of meeting? 

 Some suggestiongs: 
Universal ministry (everyone a minister), 
immediate access (not mediated by Priest or ecclesiastical structure), 
privileging peacemaking (refusing to accept any sort of social darwinism in which the strongor aggressively vocalprevail), and 
testimony of integrity (challenging participants to put beliefs into actions, even if it leads to unconventional methods)

 It doesn't have to be an apologetic for Quaker practices, but it would help explain why these practices are held so closely by Quakers, even of dramatically different theologies.

 And thank you all, for putting up with my """"bull in a china shop"""" entrance. My entries could have been read as patronizing and as assuming that I was the only """"real"""" Quaker present. I did not intend to communicate that; I am sorry. I suppose that several Quaker sensibilities were at work even here, among the tools and spare parts! Thank you for your gracious patience, all.

No one yet has any clue as to what genes work to produce hair form and yet we here such facts, probably from the view point of some American or Western person who's most familiar dark skinned group are people with mostly recent West AFrican ancestry. And admixture with whom, themselves? As i've said we barely have an itch on the genes in the field (we may be getting closer) and i have friends who have no recent relatives with less curly or coily hair, all black skinned black people and the oldest son has almost curly hair, while the daughters don't. Also, the straight hair i see in the tropics is like that of most mammals that live in the heat, sort of rough looking, and not smooth and oily like that of Northern Eurasians, or like Penguin feathers or whatever it is on walrusses. The fact is that there are Mountains up and down East Africa (where we originate), in Northern Africa, and in West Africa, whose populations are usually less heavily pigmented than other groups (Ethiopia is familiar) possibly because of the angle of the UV rays (like elsewhere). It's unscientific to speak definitively on an issue all based on subjective posterings, ie, admixture. Further, the article isn't about admixture but what selective factors may be at play here. Unless you're aim is to tell people whose ancestors may have had nappy hair that they formerly had such, which would not be very possible at the moment let alone smooth.

""""Vajpayee remains PM till new pm is asked to form a government""""   is this accurate?  All the news stories I saw said that Vajpayee resigned immediately and his resignation was accepted by the president. This is not possible.- e 

He did in fact resign, and the president did accept it. However, as is custom, the president asked him to """"continue in office til alternative arrangements are made"""". (The Hindu) http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/holnus/001200405140111.htm

 How about this? The article quite unequivocally states that Abdul Kalam appointed Singh PM. Is it a technical point that he is PM only after he's been sworn in?  | Talk 

 To summarise the entire process, once the election results in India are declared, the President has the prerogative to invite any person (by convention - the elected leader of the single largest party/coalition. Note again - the chosen leader of the party does not have to be a member of the parliament, as yet.) to form the government. Please note that invitation is not equal to appointment. If it is clear that the ruling party is getting the boot, the Prime Minister formally submits his resignation to the President, who advises him to stay in power until alternate arrangements are made. Technically, the new Prime Minister takes charge the moment the oath to the office of the Prime Minister and the oath to safeguard official secrecy are adminsitered. In case of disputed numbers, the elected government must prove its majority on the parliament hall by tabling a confidence motion, within a stipulated period. And if the leader is unelected, he/she is required to get elected from either houses of parliament within six months.

 The case of the Parliament is a little more curious. The parliament is born on the day of its first session, when the individual members are sworn in. So technically, as on date, India has a government without a parliament. It would continue to remain so, until June 2, when the monsoon session convenes.  13:37, May 27, 2004 (UTC)

 Thanks, , for the clarification.  | Talk 

First non-Hindu?
The article currently states that Manmohan Singh is the first non-Hindu to be PM. I know that a number of newspaper articles have been repeating this, but I think it's wrong (or at least disputable) in that Rajiv Gandhi was a Parsee. At any rate, his father Feroze Gandhi was half-Muslim and half-Parsee, and if I'm not mistaken Zoroastrianism was the religion passed down to Rajiv and Sanjay (not that anybody in the family is exactly religious!).  00:14, 20 Feb 2005 (UTC)

 Ownership of articles 

Hi, this is Marxus, sorry, I don't know how to use those phrases and didn't know how to use them at all. I will try to now since you have told me. You see, I wrote many articles on Richard Brautigan novels such as A Confederate General From Big Sur, The Hawkline Monster: A Gothic Western, Willard and His Bowling Trophies: A Perverse Mystery, Sombrero Fallout: A Japanese Novel, Dreaming of Babylon: A Private Eye Novel 1942, and An Unfortunate Woman: A Journey. For the novels The Hawkline Monster, Willard and His Bowling Trophies, Sombrero Fallout, and Dreaming of Babylon, I don't like when someone else changes what I have written. They create that thing on the right hand side of the novel pages about more information, I don't like that. Especially since there is no pictures on top it makes the article look bad. And I am sorry about the vandalism but I just want people changing my articles and when I change it back it goes back to the one I didn't like. I thank you for your information but please can you make that stop though and I am not trying to be rude or anything I am just asking my articles to be the way I would like them is all. Thank you and please respond.

Please note that you do not own any article; no article on Wikipedia is your article, even if you created it and are the only person who has edited it. So let me strongly suggest that you step back and think before using the phrase """"my article"""" again.

Romantic Friendship, Not Lesbianism

This article needs to be edited to change the way it deals with the argument that the Ladies were """"lesbian"""".  The Laides themselves denied this, and in fact I am not aware of any evidence that their relationship was sexual.  Yet the article refers to them as though they were in fact lesbians.  We must be careful not to impose modern ideas about sexual identity on people from the past.

In previous eras in history, it was more common for heterosexuals to express their affection for friends of the same gender in more passionate terms than we are accustomed to today. Indeed, same-gendered friends would often have an emotionally and physically intimate relationship (but without any sexual content). This was known as """"romantic friendship"""". However, since the Victorian era (with its rigid attitude towards the sexual), such relationships have declined, and there is a homophobic tendency to brand people who seek intimate (though non-sexual) relationships with people of the same gender as gay. This is something I regard as deeply unfortunate; it stems from our tendency to rigidly delineate what is """"gay"""" and what is """"straight"""". In some ways, our modern society is very insecure in terms of sexuality.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

preventative measures:
dependant upon control and elimination of the insect vector .
There is currently no artificial means of prevention.
Methods used to prevent the spread of disease, or to protect individuals in areas where malaria is endemic, include prophylactic drugs, mosquito eradication, and the prevention of mosquito bites. There is currently no vaccine that will prevent malaria, but this is an active field of research.

Some drugs that can be used for treatment of malaria can also be used for its preventative qualities however they need to be taken daily or weekly. These are seldom used by those living in a malaria abundant enivornment and are commonyl found amongst travellers visitng regions of hight malaria activity.
Quinine was used starting in the seventeenth century as a prophylactic against malaria. The development of more effective alternatives such as quinacrine, chloroquine, and primaquine in the twentieth century reduced the reliance on quinine. Today, quinine is still used to treat chloroquine resistant Plasmodium falciparum, as well as severe and cerebral stages of malaria, but is not generally for malaria prophylaxis.

Modern drugs used preventively include mefloquine (Lariam®), doxycycline (available generically), and atovaquone proguanil hydrochloride (Malarone®). The choice of which drug to use is usually driven by what drugs the parasites in the area are resistant to, as well as side-effects and other considerations. The prophylactic effect does not begin immediately upon starting taking the drugs, so people temporarily visiting malaria-endemic areas usually begin taking the drugs one to two weeks before arriving and must continue taking them for 4 weeks after leaving (atovaquone proguanil only needs be started 2 days prior and continued for 7 days afterwards).

Controlling the vector is the most useful way of preventing the spread of malaria.
Efforts to eradicate malaria by eliminating mosquitoes have been successful in some areas. Malaria was once common in the United States and southern Europe, but the draining of wetland breeding grounds and better sanitation, in conjunction with the monitoring and treatment of infected humans, eliminated it from affluent regions. In 2002, there were 1,059 cases of malaria reported in the US, including eight deaths. In five of those cases, the disease was contracted in the United States. Malaria was eliminated from the northern parts of the USA in the early twentieth century, and the use of the pesticide DDT eliminated it from the South by 1951. In the 1950s and 1960s, there was a major public health effort to eradicate malaria worldwide by selectively targeting mosquitoes in areas where malaria was rampant.[12] However, these efforts have so far failed to eradicate malaria in many parts of the developing world - the problem is most prevalent in Africa. The United States itself may face the spread of malaria in the future as climate change (warming) leads to an expansion of the areas in which mosquitoes are active..

Mosquito nets and prevention of mosquito bites

Mosquito nets help keep mosquitoes away from people, and thus greatly reduce the infection and transmission of malaria. The nets are not a perfect barrier, so they are often treated with an insecticide designed to kill the mosquito before it has time to search for a way past the net. Insecticide-treated nets (ITN) are estimated to be twice as effective as untreated nets.[16] Since the Anopheles mosquitoes feed at night, the preferred method is to hang a large """"bed net"""" above the center of a bed such that it drapes down and covers the bed completely.

The distribution of mosquito nets impregnated with insecticide (often permethrin) has been shown to be an extremely effective method of malaria prevention, and it is also one of the most cost-effective methods of prevention. These nets can often be obtained for around US$2.50 - $3.50 (2-3 euros) from the United Nations, the World Health Organization, and others.

For maximum effectiveness, the nets should be re-impregnated with insecticide every six months. This process poses a significant logistical problem in rural areas. A new type of impregnated net, called Olyset, releases insecticide for approximately 5 years[17], and costs about US$5.50. ITN's have the advantage of protecting people sleeping under the net and simultaneously killing mosquitoes that contact the net. This has the effect of killing the most dangerous mosquitoes. Some protection is also provided to others, including people sleeping in the same room but not under the net.

Unfortunately, the cost of treating malaria is high relative to income, and the illness results in lost wages. C",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Youtube link

Certainly, youtube raises some Napster-like issues, but it seems to be a lot more acceptable to the big media outlets, so I really have to wonder if adding a youtube link raises copyright violation issues for Wikipedia.

Rather, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:WEB states that """"Web-specific content is notable if it meets any one of the following criteria:""""

""""3. The content is distributed via a medium which is both well known and independent of the creators, either through an online newspaper or magazine, an online publisher, or an online broadcaster.""""

This page was getting absurdly long (over 200K) so I've gone ahead and archived it.

In my experience, the longer that a post is, the less likely that (most) other people are going to actually read it.

The word gay is an ambiguous and often pejorative term and it doesn't cover anything beside male and female homosexuals. Are bisexuals and trans people gay? According to this name, they are.

Against merge
The Uvs Nuur has already been confused by making the article about the lake instead of the basin. Much of the relevant information has been removed or confused in the merge or copy/paste or whatever an editor did. The hollow, although lumped in with the World Heritage site is really about a different set of issues including nomadic peoples, archeology sites, enormous variation in terrain, endangered animals etc. The current article on Uvs Nuur seems to have missed all the relevant points on the geological aspects, plus the name of the article is different from the name given on World Heritage Site. Further, the editors have disregarded that almost all citations are about the basin; there is hardly anything in the article about the lake. 

If you refuse to allow editors to write articles that they are interested in, and insist on an instant mindless merge, we can have an RFC, which I will abide by, unless you consent to a rewrite of the current article so it is accurate and not confusing. Why do you have such an investment in preventing other editors from writing articles about what they are interested in.

I'll have a think about this.  Some of it amounts to, hmm, not a basic civility, but an outright encouragement.  I'd like to take that up.  Sometimes, however, a citation formatting decline is due to fundamental errors.  I think a Comments with a lapse is better for the first type.  I'm still sticking with Decline for the second type.
A third case is 2c errors concealing 1c errors.  Often real 1c checking can't begin without appropriate citations.  Perhaps this is a subset of the second kind of problem, where citation formatting consistency causes a decline.
Jargon is harder.  Citations are a jargon driven field.  This is mostly where I'll be thinking about it.

Avian."""" or some other partial attempt made worse through use of the citation templates without understanding the basic concept behind citation for verification.

Letter to User:Zoe

The world of Wikipedia is not what it should be and would be if people would not INITIATE personal attacks while correcting possible or actual violations of The Five Pillars of Wikipedia. The first round of Word Wars against me began all because I dared write about myself an article. Sure, call it self-promotion, but self-aggrandizement it is not. I was not fully aware of the rules then, but the fact is that there are people, not unlike myself, who are worthy of mention on Wikipedia, have sufficient write-ups, press coverage throughout the years or were a significant phenomena at a time, but who: a) cannot afford to hire PR and Publicity firms to have someone write about them on Wikipedia or b) would not impose upon their prominent friends to do so! Wikipedia should have a Special Cases Department, just as government should, were certain exceptional individuals can have their day in """"Wiki Court"""", and have a determination made by a """"Wiki Jury"""" as to whether or not they deserve a mention in Wikipedia. In any case, Alec Wilkinson, of New Yorker magazine fame, intends on writing an article about me for Wikipedia, partly out of fairness, since there is mention of Amy Alkon and her two partners in plagiarism. Amy Alkon, Advice Goddess, was one of the Three Free Advice Ladies. They read my write-up in The New Yorker and attempted to become famous at my expense! Until that time my life as The Free Advice Man was quite fulfilling, and I managed to help many people, including some on the verge of suicide. You may want to visit www.infinitysociety.org/FREEADVICEMAN.html to get the full story. Why does this matter?? Because, while it is true that I may have violated Wiki Rules in the past, which I no longer seek to do (as of Tom Harrison's warning), Wikipedia could benefit from an eccentric contributor. Yes I was and I am very angry to find that there are Wikipedians who will make unscientific statements about another person's intellectual accomplishments and worth.  Yes it is likely that there are people who go too far in enforcing the NO ORIGINAL CONTENT pillar. I am astounded that no one ever cared then (neither User:Trovatore, User:MikeTwo, or any of the current Wikipedians involved in this case) or now to make a sincere effort to contact Prof. Miklos Hernadi at The Hungarian Academy of Sciences, who will verify my status as a philosopher and who is aware of media reports in Hungary about my life as a philosopher from 1994 to 2002, including a published book of mine for which he wrote a Peer Review (he has a Ph.D.). And should Alec Wilkinson submit an article about me there should be no reason for it to be deleted. 

Look, I am 42 years of age and more European than American. Maybe Wikipedia is age-blind, but people who are younger, and perhaps less accomplished in life, should take the other person's age into consideration and communicate in a respectful and polite manner. If you analyze the whole matter, and if you are seriously interested in objectivity and making the world a better place, then you may yet come to the understanding that I never initiated any attacks, even though I did overreact at times. Also, about anti-Semitism... When someone attacks me, who really does not know me, my life's story and the reasons why the media has covered me, and dares claim that I am practically a """"nobody"""" then my reactions are perfectly understandable and given that the strong appearance of malice exists, why should I, as a Jew, not conclude, especially about persons who openly admit strong Christian identities with Christian groups that have a known track record for being anti-Jewish. Maybe CRCulver is not aware of his hate for the concept of infinity, which is my specialty and to which I profess my intellectual support for. Maybe he is not an anti-Semite, but he sure did not communicate to me (right from the beginning) as one would normally expect. As for promoting certain views and ideas; most Wikipedians and people working on Wikipedia do this all the time! Some more subtly than others. 

Anyway, you've blocked me indefinitely... Who benefits?? Look: I never went around looking to insult Wikipedians over their violations or mistakes; I never deleted information (because I think that there should be people in Wikipedia assigned for that sort of thing, and those should not be the same as those who add information!!!); .....in fact, come to think of it, that is a great idea! People who do the verifying of facts should not be those who write them...separation of Wikipowers!.... Anyway, adding an article titled """"Infinitology"""" is not violating the """"NO ORIGINAL CONTENT"""" pillar, because nowhere in that article did I talk about my name or my identity (other than being the author), and in fact talked about such prominent individuals, living and deceased, as Philip K. Dick, Isaac Asimov, Carl Sagan, Giordano Bruno, Baruch Spinoza, etc.... Anyway,",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Addressing your concerns 

888fortune, I found your comments at Duke53's talk page that flesh out some of your concerns.  I'm glad to see them, and I'm sorry I didn't spot them before I left my earlier message.  I'd like to try to address some of those concerns.

If I'm not mistaken (and please correct me if I am), this seems to be your core concern: """"I believe it is confusing to a person searching for that name to find another name.""""  You might be unaware of this, but Wikipedia has a """"redirect"""" feature that can take a commonly used search term and re-point it to the article it refers to, if that article exists under a different name.  You can try this: type """"The Wild Center"""" into Wikipedia's search box; it should take you to the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks article.

From a reader's perspective, the redirect does have the potential to be confusing: """"I typed in one thing, and the big headline at the article says something completely different!""""  Naturally we don't want such confusion.  There are two things that can help.  One is that Wikipedia will show a little message saying """"(Redirected from The Wild Center)"""" so the user at least knows they didn't somehow hit the """"Random article"""" link or something like that.  Another one that the editors of the target article can do is to make sure the common search terms are mentioned.  In this case, the article's lead sentence highlights this by introducing """"The Wild Center"""" as an alternative name, and it's in boldface so it's harder to miss.  A person searching on """"The Wild Center"""" and arriving at the Natural History Museum of the Adirondacks article will probably not be very confused, since they'll see """"The Wild Center"""" prominently displayed on the page, and since they'll more than likely already know that The Wild Center is a museum of natural history located in the Adirondacks, so the full official name is unlikely to surprise them.

You also say """"I think that the Museum has the right to choose its own name.""""  I don't think anyone would disagree with that, but it's reasonable to think that the nickname """"The Wild Center"""" could be in vogue for a few years and then replaced by another nickname. (""""The Otter Stop"""", perhaps? )  If there's a stable, official name that will stick with it for as long as it's a museum, it makes some sense to use that name for the article title and to set up redirects for all of the popular nicknames.  The purpose of Wikipedia is not to aid the museum in marketing itself, but it's definitely reasonable to adopt some of the marketing phrases if that's how a significant number of people might identify the place.

Does this satisfy any of your concerns?  I'm interested in your response.  /talk/ """,0,0,0,0,0,0

If with the term """"social construction"""" in this sentance, the statement """"Alternative hip hop, like all genres of art, is a social construction"""" is meant to convey that any musical work one calls """"alternitive hip hop"""" happens to be the product of an agent operating under certain social conditions (as opposed to working in a vacuum), or if it is meant to establish that the term """"alternative hip hop"""" was created by such an agent, then the statement is quite true.  However, a """"social construction"""" typically is opposed to a """"natural kind"""" in that it is only conventional.  In this sense it is not altogether clear if in fact the statement is true:  take the art genres """"Oil Painting"""" and """"Punk Rock"""":  it is not merely as a point of convention that we say these two genres are different, there is a matter of fact about it.  However, in neither of these senses does it straightforwardly follow that """"as such the definition is open to debate.""""

As for the second case, i might say that a man is jewish just in case his mother were jewish.

My point is not to say that the Anschluss cannot be viewed as the military annexation of Austria but that to view it as """"simply"""" that would be to """"misunderstand"""" its essence, which would not in any case provide anything like absolution but does have the effect of changing the subject (hence my wording """"tends to conceal"""").

Ok I'm going to reproduce part of my page here again to close this matter. Censoring images in any way is against Wikipedia policies. Any questions?

How Wikipedia policies/guidelines may apply to issue of Muhammad's pictures

Wikipedia:Profanity
Words and images that would be considered offensive, profane, or obscene by typical Wikipedia readers should be used if and only if their omission would cause the article to be less informative, relevant, or accurate, and no equally suitable alternatives are available. Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not.

Some editors argue that in the light of this guideline:
 Typical Wikipedia readers do not find pictures of Muhammad offensive
 Exclusion of such pictures would result in the article being less informative, relevant and accurate.
 No suitable alternatives are available, as these pictures are historic
 As the policy states, """"Including information about offensive material is part of Wikipedia's encyclopedic mission; being offensive is not."""". Therefore, the primary mission of Wikipedia and its editors is to improve articles so they are more informative. Being offensive is not Wikipedia's mission.
 In addition, there are no issues of copyrights as the copyrights for all these pictures have expired so the images can be used freely where relevant.

WP:NOT#CENSORED
This policy states:
 Wikipedia may contain content that some readers consider objectionable or offensive.
 Wikipedia cannot guarantee that articles or images are tasteful to all users or adhere to specific social or religious norms or requirements.

Printing Images of Muhammad: A minority tradition?
Some users (Itaqallah and ALM) have suggested that since printing of Muhammad's images has , therefore Wikipedia too should not print the images otherwise it will be a violation of WP:UNDUE. Cartoon images of Muhammad have been printed all over the World and this is not likely to change now:

 Group Classification 

You cannot have a """"consensus"""" on deciding to overlook a fact. The arguement of whether or not the Underground were terrorists is contradictory to the purpose of Wikipedia and is a clear violoation of WP:NPOV. 
I despise getting into arguments about what a word actually means, so lets just go to the source. 

Terrorist   
♠  One that engages in acts or an act of terrorism.  American Heritage Dictionary

Terrorism  
♠  The unlawful use or threatened use of force or violence by a person or an organized group against people or property with the intention of intimidating or coercing societies or governments, often for ideological or political reasons. 
American Heritage Dictionary

♠  The use of violence and threats to intimidate or coerce, esp. for political purposes.  Random House Unabridged Dictionary

Let's just call a spade a spade, and stop the mudslinging and pointless arguments. The Weather Underground was a Domestic Terror Group, self admitted. Regardless of which bombing they actually conducted, the fact is that they used violence to promote an agenda. The bomb that killed Robbins, Diana Oughton, and Ted Gold on March 6, 1970 was dynamite surrounded by roofing nails. Shrapnel is not added to bombs for structural damage, it is added to increase fatalities.
I am sorry but there is no difference between these people and those like Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols.
Understand that having sympathy for a cause does not change the nature of that cause. The term """"Radical left"""" denotes only an ideology devoid of actions, and should be changed to Domestic Terrorist Organization.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Are redlinks bad form? 
 regarding the Co-Freemasonry article: 

I was under the impression that redlinks in articles were quite acceptable, as long as they point to (nonexistent) articles on notable subjects that could or should be created. I could reinstate the links and create stubs for them all, but that would involve quite a bit of work; isn't the point that redlinks serve as useful signposts for others who might be able to contribute material? I'd like to put at least some of the redlinks back in...

In fact, I've just done a quick search and found Wikipedia:Red link, which agrees with what I thought. I'll add the redlinks back, checking as I go to make sure they're all notable and desirable articles. ☻ 

Check it, Fuzz: Wikipedia:Only make links that are relevant to the context. I agree, not all of them exactly need to be removed, but there's too many. Check policy, determine what should be linked, & relink it...:-)  

Righto, I have checked it, and I stick by my position. None of the redlinks should be removed. They are all relevant to the article. Please excuse me if I'm being dense, but which particular redlinks do you believe are irrelevant? Some of the blue-linked dates should be unlinked (those not containing both month and day, as per Wikipedia:Dates); apart from that, the links in the article are fine. ☻ 

Whatev's...;~) the idea of leaving many red links in is to give people an idea of articles which should probably be created, especially in a newly-created article. If they stay too long, &/or the article becomes long-of-tooth, then they should almost always be removed. Obviously, do as you feel best. I'm for sure not going to express too much care, not there...  

Thank-you for your comments. I'm not too worried now. I've run roughshod over people in the past, and I know how easy it is to do. At the moment I'm probably in danger of running roughshod over some of the people who claim to be Wiccan but have no initiatory lineage. Just as you don't consider Co-Freemasons to be Freemasons, I don't consider them to be Wiccan. The thing is, everyone editing here is doing so because there's a subject that's important to them, so there are bound to be disagreements. I feel like we're all on the same side, though, ultimately: our goal is to establish truth (or rather the wikipedia equivalent, verifiability), regardless of how many of our preconceived opinions are sacrificed in the process. ☻

First, you should know it is standard procedure for any i-ban to be mutual, even if only one party has actually done anything wrong yet.

 And just for the record, I (unsurprisingly) sincerely belief that not much new technology will come out of Newman's invention. Even leaving all the contradictions to physics aside, there is a much more pragmatic argument: Any electric motor design which """"only"""" cut backs losses by 50% (going from 90% to 95% efficency) would be of outmost commercial importance. You would be able to go (with bodyguards and lawyers if you prefer) into the development centers of Siemens, EMD, or Bombardier, demonstrate your working prototype and leave as a very rich man.
   
RI^2 = heat losses
RI*(meters/ohm) = current times distance = current momentum
Current momentum can be determined by integrating current along the length of wire (with dl as the derivative length).  It can be found in the Biot-Savart law.
To maximize current momentum / heat losses, the following should be maximized:
RI*(meters/ohm) / RI^2 = (meters/ohm)/I = cross-sectional area of wire / (resistivity * current)
But current momentum produces the magnetic field, the square of which is proportional to its energy.  So to maximize the energy of the magnetic field / heat loss.
R^2*I^2*(meters/ohm)^2 / RI^2 = R*(meters/ohm)^2 = distance^2/ohm
Just use a longer wire! I guess the mere acceleration of two opposite charges converts mass into energy, causing electromagnetic radiation. Even the simple movement of a charge can cause a magnetic field, causing acceleration, and therefore radiation! If the wire is so short, that is like shorting the battery (e.g. connecting them in series) and not using the charges to your advantage.  

OK, so I'd like to start by saying that I may more or less completely misunderstand you, but (apart from a very good remark about the mass to energy conversion), your statements look rather heterodox to me. Granted, Newman would have to have found new physics to make his machine work, but I assume we are discussing textbook physics and EE in this side note. Specifically:
 It's not the resistive (heat) losses (or other losses) which bound the electric motor's efficency to 100%. Even using a supraconducting coil and everything you wish, you won't get above 100%  the counter voltage induced by the rotation will make the input power needed to sustain rotation equal to mechanical work done.
 Equal amount of copper will give you motors of equal parameters, only with voltages and currents scaled in different, compensating directions. E.g. both thse setups will give the same magnetic field and motor operation:
 1 meter of 0,15 mm diameter copper wire (about 1 Ω) at 4 V and 4 A (stall current) and
 4 meter of 0,075mm diameter copper wire (about 16 Ω) at 16 V and 1 A (stall current)
 But I agree with your guess that the mere acceleration of two opposite charges converts mass into energy. Every time some energy is transported away from a system, the system loses mass according to E=mc²  in most cases an unmeasurable low amount. Also if you temporarily attach strings to the oppositely charged bodies, you can extract mechanical energy while reducing their distance, exactly that amount of mass will be lost (If we keep the system isolated, its total mass stays the same, e.g when letting the two bodys clonking together, the energy will first be converted to kinectic energy, then to heat, and both contribute to the mass of the system, which in effect stays constant). But in a motor the movement is periodic, so there is nothing in sight which can result in mass loss  unless some copper atoms are vanishing mysteriously or sort of transmutate into something other than normal copper.
Ouch. Not exactly briefly. Sorry.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

a644d4dd788f4b58,"""=Unbalanced critique===

The psychotherapy article needs a balanced critique section. The current article contains a section called """"criticisms and questions regarding effectiveness"""" in which a few random studies have been cited, and a laundry list of random arguments are put forward. It is not a comprehensive precis of the effectiveness literature. The article neglects a wide body of work that points to a) the success of some types of therapy with specific types of disorders, b) discipline-agnostic characteristics of therapist behaviour that contribute to success, c) superiority of psychopharmacology & psychotherapy combined, vs either intervention on it's own, d) characteristics of clients/patients that seem to benefit most from psychotherapy, and e) vested interests of stakeholders in swinging research to one side of the debate or the other and other inhibiting factors - consider the two APA's, the various laws and licensing authorities, the separate academic communities in psychiatry, philosophy, social work, occupational therapy, the professional jealousies, the profound neglect of mental illness and psychological wellbeing in public health and health insurance, and the impact of the pharmaceutical industry's deep pockets on the dominant discourse.  

Please note that I am editing anonymously in protest against the tyrrany of the editing majority. Wikipedia's non-negotiable, amateur editor norm might be appropriate for certain article categories, but in more nuanced technical spaces there is invariably a segment that make nuisances of themselves by wanting to debate every word and angle. I have watched the development of articles on schools of psychotherapy since the early 2000s, and I'm afraid time and multiple amateur edits have not improved them much. In the specific case of psychology their mistakes add to the perception that this is a wishy washy discipline void of a body of knowledge and ANY facts. I suspect that this is partly why self-respecting people who are knowledgeable don't want to be involved in what is otherwise a very worthy undertaking.

I have moved this from Haematology to keep the American spelling into Wikipedia, however much I abhor the dropping of """"AE""""s from all those bloody words like hemoglobin, ischemia and the like.  18:00, 8 Mar 2004 (UTC)

The article blood diseases is much better than this page.  
I think these two pages should be merged, but not know how to but the merge template on page.  

Very simple: take the content out of one article, put it in the other, and then turn the former into a redirect to the latter.  | T@lk 

Pages merged - lists need a lot of work.  

Insert non-formatted text here Insert non-formatted text here Insert non-formatted text here
Inexplicable text (above line) removed from article page. Does it mean anything?  

It's a newbie test, resulting from clicking the buttons above the edit window.  | T@lk 

I think that the article hematology should define hematology (as in what a hematologist does), not blood diseases.  We should create that article separately.  

I think that haematologist and haematology should remain separate pages.  They are not the same.  It is easy to click on a link to look up haematologist on the haematology page.  

I disagree. Being a hematologist is practicing hematology. Hematology is not just the diseases but just as much diagnostics, epidemiology and laboratory medicine. Together with gastroenterology it is one of the few fields that has retained its own diagnostic process (no need to send the blood film to a dedicated expert). I'd suggest moving the diseases to a seperate page and using this page to mention the main ones (red cells, white cells, transfusion and coagulation).  | T@lk 

SPELLING!
Can we please have this page retitled as hematology. It is NOT spelt hematology, sorry if american people think it is spelt like that. But ARGGGHHH, doctors were around in england long before america, the language was born here, spelling it wrongly just makes you look stupid -  regards  .

I think there is room in the world for both spellings as all things evolve differently in different locations. Including language and it's details.

 Since when were doctors in England before America? Native Americans practiced medicine. And if you refer to doctors as practitioners of modern Western medicine, remember that at the time America became a country, doctors were still trying to save people by bleeding them. —The preceding unsigned comment was added by 67.173.46.246  .

 There is a redirect from haematology to hematology, so we English will find the page.  

The page was at Haematology until  changed it to Hematology in an edit on the 5th of November, 2004, apparently in order to """"keep the American spelling into Wikipedia"""". According to Wikipedia policy, it should have stayed at Haematology (there is no preference for US English in Wikipedia), but it has been at the (admittedly awful) title of """"Hematology"""" for so long, trying to get it restored may be something of a fruitless exercise. C'est la Vie! )  

I think that probably we should leave it at hematology because moving it would provoke the opposite argument and there is a redirect, after all.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

608cb0bf5f3a6d95,"Forthcoming Changes, Outline 

The group of students at the University of British Columbia editing this wikipedia entry have tentatively decided on the following as an outline for the entry:

 History 

The purpose of this introductory section is to give the readers an insight and understanding of the background history of Hells Gate and its indigenous inhabitants. The First Nations people used Hells Gate as a prime salmon fishing ground, and because of this, it became one of many locations for a popular fish station. I also discuss the environmental reasoning (deglaciation) behind the presence of salmon, and subsequently indigenous people in the Fraser Canyon and Hells Gate area.   
 Hells Gate Slide 
This section will focus on the Hells Gate Slide itself, beginning with the construction of the Canadian Northern Railway which spurred the slide. It will discuss how human impact and the slide changed the water ecology and what measures were initially taken in order to solve the issue.   
 Environmental Impacts 

The main focus of this section would be damage to the local environment due to the slide. It would address the impact the Hells Gate slide had on the fish habitat, particularly focusing on the sockeye salmon runs disruption. It would then explore the decline in the salmon population due to the incident and would focus on the relocation of the salmon, which was unable to reach the spawning grounds, into other rivers.
  

 Social and Political Impacts 
In this section we will look at the social impacts on the native fisheries and on the commercial fisheries that happened as a result of the hells gate slide.

 The International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission (IPSFC 
Here I'll discuss how the Commission came to be, what it was comprised of, who was in it, how it functioned, etc. also their research (although this may go in the next section). This section may be relatively small, as there is already an existing entry on the Commission.

 International Dispute 
Discuss the disputed research methods and conclusions, and the escalating conflict
 Government Response 
This section will deal with the response to the slide - building of fishways, etc.

An island cannot be a nation/culture/state in itself, nor inherently owned by anyone. I'm afraid it is simply fascistic to claim land in this way - let alone abuse powers to enforce it. When another nation covers part of the island (in this case the United Kingdom), it makes it doubly wrong. Wikipedia needs a clear policy to stop nations from claiming a land article, especially when they already have an official article. One each, you greedy scoundrels - one each. If you are really into 'history', organise it like everyone else: Historical 'era' articles simply must be subsets of the official nation article. 

I cannot stress this enough: Wikipedia should NEVER assert that any nation is a land, however long a nation has been associated with it. Read the papers - read about Europe. Read about the blood shed - read about the world. We simply cannot let this be done. But has anyone got the guts to address 'policy', I wonder?

Wikipedia uber alles? I don't think so. Wikimedia ironically owns nothing but its ventures, and this inherently right-wing 'anarchy Wikipedia' is destined to ultimately fall. If it has sense (and value), it will adapt and change instead.
 
I'd be obliged if people leave my talk page in peace now. I'm switching off my email too - it was only open for another issue.   

PS (last one). Of course the word 'country' can mean 'countryside' in an emotive sense - but that cannot be a definition regarding groups of people on Wikipedia. The Wikipedia 'top list' should be List of countries: Sovereign states/Nations/Tribes. Country should always be used as the disambiguator. No-one gets pushed out of the whole structure then (as they do now), and they are all admitted to be 'country'-connected in some way - but is doesn't include any land masses! Footnotes can be made for cases if needed - it simply won't be messier than it is now, far from it. 

People need to take up the mantle on all of this. There are many people on Wikipedia trying to engineer the 'identity mess' on Wikipedia to support their nationalistic views. At its most negative, this is often a 'comparative' matter for them - so they often go after other cases/causes more than directly push their own. The two Irelands and the very specific 'constituent countries' of the United Kingdom are always on their radar, and this crazy disruption over the Irelands now has made them stronger, without doubt. A quick glance at my 700 page watchlist confims that. Logical consistency leads to stability, anarchy like we have now leads to disruption",0,0,0,0,0,0

I wasn't sure where to list this.  A dissertation by Samuel Brenner at Brown University in 2009 is largely focused on the JBS:

http://www.samuelbrenner.com/Resume%20and%20Professional/Dissertation.htm

Abstract:

This dissertation seeks to accomplish four goals: first, to trace the development and history of ultra-conservative anti-communist conspiracists – who referred to themselves as “Americanists” – from the emergence of Americanist speakers near the beginning of the 1950s, through the creation of Americanist grassroots organizations such as the John Birch Society near the end of the 1950s and the political heyday of Americanism in the early-to-mid 1960s, until the eventual marginalization and slow decline of Americanism as a political and social force in the mid-to-late 1960s.  Second, to focus attention not only on the messages and goals of Americanist leaders, but also on the ideas, views, and concerns of ordinary Americanists, as reflected through letters Americanists wrote to each other, to national magazines and conservative periodicals, to Robert Welch and the John Birch Society, to Dr. Fred Schwarz and the Christian Anti-Communism Crusade (CACC), and even to J. Edgar Hoover and the FBI.  Third, to address some of the stereotypical views of the Birch Society and its allies – primarily that Americanists were vicious racists and anti-Semites akin to George Lincoln Rockwell and the American Nazi Party – and to explore what were in fact ambiguous and nuanced attitudes toward African Americans, Jews, anti-Semitism, racism, Zionism, and the civil rights movement.  Fourth, to demonstrate that many of the members of the Birch Society, attendees at the CACC’s “Schools of Anti-Communism,” and listeners to Clarence Manion and Dan Smoot shared a coherent political ideology, which they called “Americanism,” and saw it as their task to inform Americans about the benefits of free market economics, religion, states’ rights, and personal autonomy and the grave dangers of communism, liberalism, collectivism, atheism, and one-worldism.  

This dissertation is divided into three parts: Part I traces the history of Americanism and Americanists between the early 1950s and the early 1970s.  Part II focuses on the critical period between 1958 and 1965, and uses letters and messages to determine what typical Americanists were thinking, saying, and doing during a time of great political and social change.  Part III examines the complicated Americanist views of racism, anti-Semitism, African Americans, and Jews.

A link to it should be added into one of the sections on sources, whichever section is best.  The author isn't really writing as pro-JBS or anti-JBS, so I'm not sure where to list it.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Fyunclick vs. Outside Sources

Wikipedia is an """"encyclopedia"""" and as such, should reflect outside sources, not one's own POV. Not only that, Wikipolicy calls for PLURALISM which requires the articles to reflect major points of view, not just one. However, in this case probably the majority, if not a plurality, of sources reflect my POV. For example:

http://sports.espn.go.com/sports/tennis/history?type=men

When ESPN lists the winners of Grand slams, they don't worry about issues such as Open era/pre-Open era, challenge round, or pre-1925 French. Not only that, but research has shown that the French was actually MORE open to outside competition than the US Open and Wimbledon were in their early stages. 20:15, 5""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 help with course of action concerning possible infringement 

Hello Kevin!

It's evening here in Romania and I'm back on WP. Thanks for your offer to help.
Here's the story in a nutshell:
I went to school with a famous sportsperson and multiple Olympic champion and she's still a rather close friend. Needless to say none of the existing WP articles about her were written by me because, despite the notability being out of question, I felt I couldn't be objective. But those articles exist.
Yesterday she brought to my attention that a book was published in the States,(apparently in 2010) containing her biography and with the statement  on the cover that it was """"based on high quality Wikipedia articles"""". She says that, according to what she was told, it sells on Amazon for 50 USD/48 EUR and that she would send me a link from the Barnes&Noble; website. There are several issues here: first, both she and I don't think it's ethical to publish any kind of biography of a living person without notifying the person (and at least her business address is widely known). Secondly, and which has to do directly with Wikipedia, both she and I don't believe that one can, just like that, copy &paste; content that is made available for free and make profit out of it (how much of this book did the authors actually work for? we don't know, because we don't have it yet; but they take pride in """"basing"""" it on wp which  is not a good sign).

OK, I tried to read my way through the terms of use pages, read about the new terms of use, too (although probably they shouldn't apply retroactively) but I couldn't get a clear picture of what applies here and what can be done. I'll come back with the link when I get it. Thanks again   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The year 140 AD is leap year so if Thoht 1 is July 20 in 139 AD
it is July 19 for the next 3 years, all 4 years claimed as the rise of Sothis.
The year 2773 BC is likewise a Thoth 1 on July 17 whose previous year is July 18.
4241 BC is a July 19 date for Thoth 1.
As for correlation placing Egypt's earliets dates as 2170 BC and 2030 BC and 2001 BC etc;
the date for Thoht 1 is Jan 6 in 2001 BC and the winter solstice.
The wprt name for new year has been used for sothis but also for solstice
and not clear whether winter or summer. Connecting it to Nile flood doesnt help
when the myth of Noah's flood is at winter solstice. Further, if Thot is the 7th month
then Epagum days begin July 5 in 2001 BC so that the July 10 solstice is Pamenot 1 not 6.
Every disagreement in short Genesis has a counterpart application in Egypt.
Example, reunification in year 955. If Flood is year 600, and Noah dies in year 350,
he dies in the year 350 that the Pharaoh was created.
If using a 360-day calendar for those 350 years, then from year 600 it is year 955.
Unification of dynasties 1-5 is then the same year and event for dynasties 6-10.
The 5th being dead in Genesis in year 340, but in LXX in year 768.
The date 1872 BC July 17 is Memphis. But what if its at Fort Quban where
sothis rises on July 10 the solstice during the 12th dynasty. That blows those
who try to trace July 20 back to a Gregorian solstice in 4242 BC.
And at the time of that July 10 date in the year 120 of the 12th dynasty,
let's say 1824 BC July 10 as second month Parmuti 16 (versus 8th month 22)

What Hasselbach stated is laughable (if he really did say that), since the Nordic National Socialists were in the extreme minority. Hitler himself was far from Nordic!

The Nazis indeed made some huge mistakes: the anti-Slavic agenda was what ruined them. But despite this, these days, neo-Nazis generally include people from pretty much every European ethnic group, including Southern Europeans and Slavic people. Presently, the term """"neo-Nazi"""" is synonymous with 'White Nationalist"""" and doesn't necessarily refer to a belief in the Nazi policies of the 30s and 40s.

Track and Field
The sport of Track and Field does not have the same kind of dividing line as other """"Professional"""" sports.

If you are really a very active Jew, then you would know that the Name itself is never pronounced aloud, and that the Hebrew letters that comprise it could possibly be the literal spelling of neither """"Adonai"""" nor """"haShem"""".

Requests for comment
I've echoed the suggestions of Mackensen and others that you take this to Wikipedia:Requests for comment.  Your most recent reply on Mackensen's talk page is:

 I could, but I think Arbcom should accept the case with or without an RfC. There's too much misconduct to willfully ignore. Besides, you're only asking me to do that to delay the inevitable, why would I ever take that advice?

There are several problems with this response:
 Firstly a number of other editors have asked you to go through RfC: , the  closer or the first Articles for deletion discussion, , who as far as I can tell played no part in earlier discussions,  who also seems to have been absent from earlier discussions, and , an arbitrator who in rejecting the case said """"If you can't be bothered with an RfC then we can't be bothered with an arbitration case.""""  has also remarked on your failure to follow process here.
 Again you allege misconduct, on a scale too great """"to wilfully ignore"""".  If there appears to be such a level of misconduct and yet the arbitrators can't see it, it looks like you'll have to make it more apparent to them.

But finally, despite all the others including arbitrators who have asked you to go to RfC, you say that I in particular am only asking you to go to RfC """"to delay the inevitable"""".  Well I'm not sure that you and I can agree on what """"the inevitable"""" is in this case.  To my eyes this looks a case on which you really wouldn't like to hear what the arbitrators have to say, and they've hinted on this in their comments on the case.  But since they're obviously not going to accept the case until you've at least made an honest attempt to conduct some intermediate steps in dispute resolution, I'm urging you to do so.  If an arbitration case follows, the sooner the better as far as I'm concerned, so get cracking. Tony Sidaway """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Character bios 

It is of my opinion that the short character bios preceeding the main characters' character descriptions are more than trivial information than what we really need to have in the article. Also, it's not usually standard to give this type of information in characters sections on Wikipedia (I've seen at least), so I am going to go ahead and delete them.  (|talk) 

I have just added the Zuka Club to the 'supporting characters' section; I thought they were at least as deserving of being mentioned as Nekozawa and Renge. I'm not so good with adding pictures - especially when I have none - or Japanese kanji. Is there anyone who can add these?  

Well, I added the clubs section and a pic for each club, and I'll get to the kanji for Zuka next.  (|talk) 

 Cool. Nice choice of pictures.  

I've added a brief piece on Kotoko Fujioka to the 'supporting characters' section. Do you guys think it's too much ...? And if not, could someone add the kanji and a picture?

I added her picture, but I don't know where to find the kanji for Kotoko.  (|talk) 

They should be visible in the fansub of episode 19; there's a scene of Ranka and Kotoko (Haruhi inside) when Ranka is having a flashback. I can't read kanji myself, but the translation for the caption text said that's what it says.

 Japanese Title 
While glancing through the edit history, I found it interesting that a revert had been done with a comment that the previous user should learn to read katakana before making edits on the Japanese part of the pages.  Not being the user in question who made the first change that got reverted, I can only speculate on how much they actually knew, but the change made (and then reverted) wasn't involved with katakana at all, as it was regarding the 部 in 桜蘭高校ホスト部, which is kanji.

Now, I'm not all that fluent in the language, but I've seen no record of 部 being *directly* romanized into kurabu.  I have heard the characters use both hosuto-bu (ホスト部) and hosuto kurabu (ホストクラブ) at different times fairly interchangably, but the title of the anime itself uses the kanji.  Is there a translation for the kanji that directly romanizes into kurabu that I'm not aware of?  

I've since figured out that the reason for this difference is due to the furigana used in both the anime and manga's titles, hence the confusion - the loanword kurabu isn't normally a given reading for the kanji.  However, in the two episodes of the anime where ホスト部 is directly referenced in the episode title, Haruhi uses bu instead of kurabu when reading it aloud, so there is still a difference there.  What would be the suggested method to approach this, given the vocal reading of it in the anime versus the usage of kurabu in the romanization of 部 in all Ouran-related pages, including the Episode title list?  

I'll be glad to clear this up for you. If you look at the image of the title of the anime given here, we see that above the kanji and to the left are a series of katakana characters. The last 3 of which spell out ku-ra-bu, hence why I stated the anon user learn to read katakana before editing the title again.  (|talk) 

Yes, the furigana, as I noted later.  The anon user seemed either familiar with kanji itself though or used one of the translations that was based on only the kanji - without the furigana as a guide, 'bu' would be the",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Free Software / Open Source 

In many articles you show your intention to use the phrase """"free and open source"""". 
The best way to deal with this is to choose the term used by the developers of the programs in question themselves. If you are working on a page about a program where the developers explicitly use that term I have no objection. If the developers use """"free software"""" it is best to use exactly that for that specific program. If the developers of a certain program use only """"open source"""" and the license of the program is indeed an open source license (Excluding the GNU GPL. Its text explicitly uses the term """"free software"""") then it's ok to use that description. 

The purpose is that the reader should not understand the word """"free"""" to mean """"gratis"""" in this case. Unfortunately just using """"free"""" alone makes it more likely that people will understand """"gratis"""".

If you software into that phrase """"free and open source"""" something like """"open source and free software"""" it would be better.

Part III

What's with blanking out the names completely? So much for compromise. I'm going back to COUNTING the pre-1925 champions. Here's why:

1. The outside sources, such as the Encyclopedia Britannica, list them.

2. All the arguments that could be made against the pre-1925 French tournament could also be made against the other three.

3. The idea of the """"slam"""" didn't even emerge until the 1930s, with Don Budge...but do we see anyone black out pre-1938 Wimbledon champs?

4. It's clear that the French tournament was MORE open...their first champ was a Brit, as was two runners-up in the early decades. Interestingly, the US """"Open"""" in 1881 was open only to Americans, and was for several years. Yet we count them, because that's the origin of the tournament.

5. There's also the pro-am dispute, pre-1968. 

6. Wikipedia is supposed to reflect pluralistic viewpoints, not just the one of one person such as Fyunclick who violates WP:OWN to contort this and similar tennis articles to reflect his own views, rather than reflecting outside sources that existed long before Wikipedia did.

Are you going to give me an apology?  When you wrote that comment (January 3), you suggested that I was being 'impatient'.  But it's now 13 days LATER.  Dodo is being rather scarce, even today.   Your excuse, that Dodo didn't answer because he 'isn't at his computer' is wearing pretty thin, nearly two weeks later.  It looks to me that I was correct:  At the time, Dodo was not responding, but that was NOT because he 'isn't at his computer'.  Rather, he was not responding, because he had been caught doing 'drive-by edits'.   Dodo 'ran away', and he let his minions cover his ass while he ran.  At the time (January 3), you got away with claiming that I was being 'impatient', because it was at least plausible that Dodo wasn't at his computer.  But the validity of such an excuse hasn't stood the test of time.
It's really quite simple:  Wikipedia obviously attracts 'control freaks', 'info-Nazi's', etc.  Such people insinuate themselves into a position of control, as 'Administrators' if possible.

e262aaecc0399702,"""==Translation issues==
In the original German was a sentence, """"Vor dem Dalang liegt auch kein Bananenstrunk, der die Puppen aufnimmt, sondern ein Plangkan (eine Art Tisch mit Löchern in der Tischplatte), auf dem die benötigten Puppen bereit gestellt werden.""""

I am changing this to simply , """"In front of the Dalang is a Plangkan (a type of table with holes punched in its surface), on which the necessary puppets sit ready for use. 

I think (but am not certain) that the that the untranslated part is more or less a joke: roughly, that there what is on the table is not a foo foo drink for the puppets. If anyone with better German than me thinks I'm wrong and there is something more substantial here, please restore the appropriate phrase. Thanks.

 

Another sentence with which I had trouble: Die Figuren dieser Schattenspiele waren Wayang Golek (normale Kopfgestalt durch einen da-mit verbundenen Stab auf dem Rumpf drehbar. Arme durch je ein Stab, der an der Hand befestigt ist beweglich) , geschnitzte, bemalte und bekleidete Figuren, die an Fäden gezogen wurden, Malereien auf Schautafeln oder geweihte und verkleidete Menschen.

I've rendered this """"The figures in these puppet plays were wayang golek (normally a head assembly connected by a straight stick to a trunk, allowing the head to swivel. Arms were attached to a separate staff, allowing hand motions), carved, painted and dressed figures, manipulated via threads or strings, painted dioramas or sanctified and dressed humans,"""" but that may not be quite right. If you know better, please correct the article (and make a note here that you've done so).   18:03, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Your translation seems OK. Geweihte could also mean """"horned"""", which would make sense in the case of demons. """"Sanctified"""", as in """"blessed"""", makes less sense in the context.  12:44, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Another tricky one: Wayang-Klitik-Figuren meist erheblich beschädigt, sehr zum Gaudium der Zuschauer..."""" I haven't even ventured a translation for this, it has several words I don't properly know. Is Gaudium perhaps the Latin word, as in """"gaudeamus igitur""""?   18:03, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)  This has now been satisfactorily rendered.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)

Another problematic sentence: Aus diesem Grunde haben Wayang-Klitik-Figuren, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden und dort Kampfszenen zu durchstehen haben, Arme aus Leder. I currently have this partially translated as """"On this basis the wayang klitik figures have, die zu Spielen herangezogen werden and where battle scenes zu durchstehen haben, leather arms."""" I know that durchstehen is to stand one's ground, but I still can't fully translate the sentence.   18:17, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)  This has now been satisfactorily rendered.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)

And another: Aus Jenggala und Kediri stammen die Geschichten von Raden Panji und Cindelaras, die ein paar Dorfjungen mit ihren Kampfhähnen erleben. The first part is """"From Jenggala and Kediri come the stories of Raden Panji and Cindelara,"""" I'm not at all clear on the latter part. My dictionary says Kampfhähnen are literally fighting cocks, but can just be pugnacious people.   19:46, 1 Jun 2004 (UTC)
 Someone else has now simply rendered this as fighting cocks, but I'd consider that suspect (since one can't tell from the original German). I'd like to find a more primary source before considering this necessarily correct.   05:40, Jun 5, 2004 (UTC)
 I translated it as I did, because it explicitly says """"the boys with their X"""", and not somthing like """"the two x-like boys"""".  12:44, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

An interesting link: Wooden puppet is performed almost the same way as the wayang kulit, but there is no screen in front of the puppeteer, and no banana trunk to stuck the wayang. In stead a 'Plangkan' (permanent wooden table with holes) to support the wooden puppets is used.''
 12:52, 5 Jun 2004 (UTC)

 Hmm. Looks like we could have a copyvio on our hands. That would really be a pain after so much work went into a translation. I'm not sure quite what to do with this...   02:30, Jun 6, 2004 (UTC)

Libelous Content Warning
Errors in reposting of old entry:

I reverted this entry back to the content I posted back in November (making certain modifications since Mills is no longer Insurance Superintendent) because of the following errors and libelous content:

1.  Old entry starts that Mills was from Middletown, but he was originally from the Town of Wallkill.

2.  The police department entry was not cited, and I happen to know that the content listed here happened after Mills had left the Town Supervisor post.

3.  Information about his decision to run for office again is not cited, and the quote """"many political observers believe his ethical lapses will be too great a hurdle to overcome in any future bid for elective office"""" is not cited and has no basis in fact.

I implore users not to make any other changes which are libelous and error ridden.  Thank you!

Tioga County Results
Howard Mills did not win Tioga county.  On election night it first appeared as though he did.  However when the Board of Elections counted the absentee and affidavit ballots he lost.

Howard Mills received 9,602 votes on the Republican Party line.

Charles Schumer received 9,790 votes on the Democratic Party line, plus 647 votes on the Independence Party line and 435 votes on the Working Families Line for a total of 10,872 votes to Howard Mills 9,602.

Gender equality is one of this project's central concepts. It was AWOL.
(reposted from Portal_talk:Feminism)

Essentially, variations on Gender equality had been hijacked six or so months ago by redirects to both Zygarchy and Equalism, and had actually begun to affect the conversation across the internet. 

This is bad news, as these terms have nothing behind them but ill-defined assertions. I've rarely been embarrassed for Wikipedia, but this is one of those moments where the site's power was left in the hands of POV/OR mischief-makers.

""""Zygarchy"""" is a made-up word that would never meet the WP:NEO standard if anyone had caught it. It has never meant """"rule of two genders"""" before someone asserted it on Wikipedia. There are a couple hundred blogs out there crowing about the """"new word they'd learned"""" while learning less than zero about notable, verifiable internationally-established gender policy. (Somewhat ominously, """"zygarchy"""" is an obscure but genuine term for an ancient military formation involving two chariots. I think the chariots were used to run infantry over... or to cut them down with a chain between them...)

""""Equalism"""" has been used by notable sources and scholars but never consistently. There was some effort to use it to refer to communism in the fifties, anarchism at various points, and some among the Facebook crowd seem to like it better than """"feminism""""; one news citation in Sweden counts it as a subset of feminism. That is to say, it's a semantic game: There is no """"-ism"""" there, just a desire for one, a moving target without a developed philosophy behind it. I've redirected it to a far more notable article, Egalitarianism.

Nearly every instance of a wikilink to Gender equality had been piped to Equalism. That's what last night was all about for me: finding and removing the plumbing from this phantasm.

I've reestablished the Gender equality article with cites to the UN and an external link to the World Bank. I've added it to the various gender studies and feminism templates. This is one of this project's central concepts, and we really have to watch these pages. Cheers,  ✉ """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Crunch (AGT Crunch Acquisition, LLC) is a fitness-based enterprise that is focused on making entertainment an integral part of the exercise experience. Established in New York in 1989, today the Crunch brand has 27 locations in 7 major urban centers in the United States: New York City, Brooklyn, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles. As a strategy, Crunch has concentrated on expanding inside of these urban centers: its penchant for innovation resonating especially well with the various demographics therein.  Because of these factors the brand is often associated with descriptors such as “hip”, “edgy”, “urban” etc. and has an air of inherent coolness that the majority of its competitors cannot claim to.

FEATURES:

1)TABGROUP FITNESS CLASSES
Since its inception Crunch has maintained a focus on its group fitness program as the brand’s cornerstone. As such, it has built an extensive catalogue of classes that are characterized by their broad appeal and inventiveness. Numbering in the hundreds, these classes are organized into three different categories: Action Sports, Chill Outs and Dance Rhythms. Examples (taken from the official Crunch website) include:
Urbanathlete (Action Sports)
This circuit-style class is based on Men’s Health Magazine’s Fitness Challenge.  In it you’ll work through obstacles and exercises that were inspired by various cityscapes and come to see just about any sprawling metropolis as a big, concrete playground. 

Antigravity Yoga ‘Wings’ (Chill Outs)
Wings’ will have you stretching further and holding challenging poses longer, using only a fabric trapeze to do so.  And, by employing simple suspension techniques you’ll move into poses that are seemingly impossible.  However, the goal isn’t just to turn you into a human pretzel: those poses will help to relieve compressed joints and align your body from head to toe.

Cardio Dance Blast (Dance Rhythms)
Get your groove on in this sixty-minute class that’s been cleverly disguised as a dance party – one with a soundtrack comprised of the best in hip-hop, reggae and top-forty music.  You’ll melt away fat while bringing your dance skills to the next level and beyond.
In addition, Crunch offers private versions of their classes for small groups.

2)TABPERSONAL TRAINING
Each Crunch location has a staff of personal trainers available to its members for individual or semi-private sessions. Crunch divides these personal trainers into four different categories based on experience and certifications earned. (All of Crunch’s personal trainers are required to have a minimum of professional experience and certifications earned prior to being hired.) Collectively, these trainers have expertise in a broad range of areas. Quoting from the company’s press kit, “All Crunch clubs are staffed with first-rate fitness professionals – personal trainers with certifications in a wide variety of specialties: strength training, yoga, boxing, kickboxing, pre/post natal, kettle bells, physical rehabilitation and much more.”

3) EQUIPMENT
All Crunch locations feature a wide array of fitness equipment produced by the industry’s leading manufacturers: Precor, Life Fitness, Netpulse, Expresso, Icarian, Hammer Strength etc. This equipment is updated with an eye toward keeping current with emerging technologies and trends. For example Crunch is phasing in Life Fitness’ treadmills with built-in iPod functionality. Select Crunch locations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles feature Pilates studios equipped with both Reformers and Wunda Chair Systems and locations in all markets feature Yoga studios. Additionally, certain facilities have more elaborate features: full-sized boxing rings, swimming pools, indoor tracks, basketball courts, saunas, hot tubs and sundecks.  

4) SPECIAL EVENTS AND UNIQUE OFFERINGS
The following is taken from Crunch’s current press kit regarding special events and unique offerings: 


Crunch health clubs are home to a unique fusion of entertainment and fitness, one that we have pioneered from our inception and continue to explore through a number of different channels. In-gym parties and performances (by students of Scratch DJ Academy), an outdoor summer concert series, partnerships with cutting-edge theatrical productions like Spiegelworld and Fuerzabruta and our Broadway Dance Series are all hallmarks of this exploration. Additionally, we’ve developed a number of events that take place outside of our gyms, like field trips (which are held year-round in all of our markets and vary greatly in destination) a",0,0,0,0,0,0

Certainly not. The alphabet has been copied """"as is"""" from Swedish, and it has been so since Mikael Agricola began writing Finnish. Fortunately the Swedish alphabet contains enough sounds like Ä and Ö that Finnish speakers didn't have to design any new letters. Then again, unused letters like Q and Å remain. The last changes to Finnish orthography with respect to the alphabet were the changes from 'C' to 'K', 'X' to 'KS', 'TZ' to 'TS' and 'W' to 'V', in the 18th and 19th century. 'C', 'X', 'Z' and 'W' remained in the alphabet but were no longer used.

Okay. We have a disagreement about the infobox.
Let's try to work it out here, rather than edit warring over the article.

First off, let me present my position:
This is an encyclopediac article, or at least it should be. As such, it should contain all significantly relevant information, and it should prioritize the information someone would want to find most easily.
Kaiser's logo is relevant to anyone who wants to know about Kaiser, it seems Wikipedia considers the identity of the CEO of an organization relevant, and their website seems almost required - if someone, for instance, came to Wikipedia in order to find the website, they should be able to do so moderately easily; Kaiser's website should, in an article about Kaiser, stand out from all other links in some way.

Vandalism warning
One or more of the children of Sonja de Lennart appear to have engaged in a lengthy hoax, beginning around December 2007, to convince the world that their mother was a famous designer in the 1940s and 1950s (although a Google search reveals no references in any fashion or other reputable sources until 2008), including vandalism of numerous Wikipedia articles (Emilio Pucci and Capri pants articles were vandalized).

Recent news articles on Capri pants have picked up the false information (the Wikipedia article on Capri pants has been duplicated on answers.com and other reference sites), and these are being used to further the hoax.  

The """"official website"""" of Sonja De Lennart was created by her daughter, Eleonora De Lennart, in February 2008, and was serving as the """"reputable source"""" for the claim that Sonja De Lennart created Capri pants (heretofore generally attributed to Emilio Pucci) until the news articles came up in June 2008.

Users Pchip and Delennart are the two Wikipedia IDs responsible for this hoax - user Delennart began repeatedly vandalizing the Emilio Pucci and Capri pants pages on December 30, 2007 to insert references to Sonja De Lennart as the creator of Capri pants, and after other Wikipedia users instructed her that the discussion of Sonja De Lennart was not appropriate on the Emilio Pucci page, user Delennart stopped contributing to Wikipedia and user Pchip suddenly appeared in February 2008 to further vandalize the Capri pants page and to create the hoax page for Sonja De Lennart.

 Korean articles 
I put this on Shabby's talk page and I thought you should check it out as well:

Hi, I noticed you were taking part in the discussion on the Talk:Hwang Seong-gyeong page. I think Bethereds behaviour is ridiculous and something needs to be done to stop his ownership of these pages. He said that he would """"change the pages back until the end of time"""" as he thinks he is right in removing any Japanese reference from """"his"""" Korean pages. There are many reasons why Japanese katakana should be included in these pages (the obvious being that the characters are created by a Japanese company and that every other article includes it bar the few Korean characters). Is there any way to call a moderator or administrator to this debate to stop Bethereds reverts? He seems to have no proper reason as to why he is omitting the information other than he believes Korea is better than Japan (I've read his user page and looked at his previous edits and he seems to be doing anything he can to promote Korea over Japan). Does he not realise that in these games, even Chang and Kim (from KOF) speak in the Japanese language and have never even uttered a Korean word? We need a vote or something to put him right. Thanks.

re German Pigeon Club Links
G'day Mate, I guess what I'm trying to say by wanting them footnoted is that """"External links should not normally be used in the body of an article"""" as per that style guideline. Quite frankly it looks bad in an article when they are done like that. In my opinion I think it's better to select/adapt info from the website and link (footnote) to it in the reference section. Otherwise just add the links to the external link section. Actually that would probably be best for the German club main page link to just be added to external links. No need to have two active links in that particular paragraph. It does look terrible per WP:MOS it suggest  looks better. I'd be inclined to use (in German) however. So no ones doubting the veracity or anything like that mate -) Just trying to clean things up is all. So I'm suggesting now we just add the first link (VDT-online main page) to the external links section (delink the text in article) and footnote the second link to a reference section or otherwise use (in German) at the end of the sentence rather than linking the text. In my opinion that would look a whole lot better and fits the Wikipedia guidelines better.  Buzz Me... """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 US emissions description is totally contentless now. 

The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US """"partial zero emissions vehicle"""" could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.

Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.

Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.

It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad """"20mpg"""" reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.

Hi Michael

I haven't saved your email address, can not find it through Google so must contact you this way. 

I've just paid a random visit at 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPS_tracking

and found an external link there - 

http://www.goandtrack.com/ ,

the penultimate at this moment. When going through their pages, I also found this one:

http://www.goandtrack.com/gps_tracking_devices/covert_vehicle_tracking.htm .

The first chapter, called 'Covert Vehicle Tracking GPS System', starts this way:

'The latest in GPS covert tracking and communications technology, this covert vehicle surveillance unit is an extremely small size and versatile location device that allows you to track vehicles or other high value mobile assets in real time. The covert vehicle tracking devices is attached underneath a vehicle using the high power light weight magnets. Here it picks up reflected GPS signals and reports position information back to your PC using SMS messages.'

Doesn't that sound promising, so to speak? Unless I'm mistaken, it proves the correctness of my earlier assumptions. I invite you to read the rest of the page and then update the Wikipedia entry. You will remember, for linguistic reasons I prefer not to do these things myself.

I haven't established a webform contact facility, so invite you to contact me directly, if you wish.

Best regards

Michael

c7474cb6d357cd0c,"""   hydroelectric dams,
Although hydroelectric power is admittedly one of the cleanest and most environmentally-friendly sources of energy, it too has the capability to alter or damage its surroundings. Among the main problems that have been demonstrated by hydroelectric power is significant change in water quality. Because of the nature of hydroelectric systems, the water often takes on a higher temperature, loses oxygen content, experiences siltation, and gains in phosphorus and nitrogen content. 

Man has utilized the power of water for years. Much of the growth of early colonial American industry can be attributed to hydropower. Because fuel such as coal and wood were not readily available to inland cities, American settlers were forced to turn to other alternatives. Falling water was ideal for powering sawmills and grist mills.

As coal became a better-developed source of fuel, however, the importance of hydropower decreased. When canals began to be built off of the Mississippi River, inland cities became linked to mainstream commerce. This opened the flow of coal to most areas of America, dealing the final blow to hydropower in early America.

Water power really didn't stage a major comeback until the 20th century. The development of an electric generator helped increase hydropower's importance. In the mid-20th century, as Americans began to move out of the cities and into """"suburbia,"""" the demand for electricity increased, as did the role of hydroelectricity. Hydroelectric power plants were built near large cities to supplement power production.

Disadvantages

Smaller models depend on availability of fast flowing streams or rivers 
Run-of-the-River plants can impact the mobility of fish and other riverlife. NOTE: Building a fish ladder can lessen this negative aspect of hydroelectric power 
Hydropower had some help from the federal government in being established in America. The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was implemented during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The program was designed to correct several problems in the Tennessee River Basin. These problems included frequent floods, erosion, and deforestation. The TVA provided for the building of several hydroelectric dams. Not only were the dams successful in controlling the flooding, they also provide electricity to the region. The TVA is an example of successful implementation of hydroelectric power.

There are many different ways in which the abundance of energy around us can be stored, converted, and amplified for our use. To help you understand the key energy sources that will play an important role in the world's future, we have designed a number of pages to familiarize you with some of the history, theory, economics, and problems of the various types of energy. 
The energy sources have been split into three categories: fossil fuels, renewable sources, and nuclear sources. The fossil fuels covered here are coal, petroleum, and natural gas. The renewable energy sources are solar, wind, hydroelectric, biomass, and geothermal power. The nuclear-powered sources are fission and fusion.

I placed th {{underconstruction}} tag at the top of the page for a reason, he should embrace the progressing of the article and respect the concept of the tag instead of trollishly reverting hours and hours of work just because he, in this communist agenda """"doesn't like it"""". Nobody has to ask the permission of Chip Berlet before working on the article and adding vertified information, you do not WP:OWN it or control who can contribute to it and you are not god. Here is what Chip Berlet would like to hold back from the general public who wish to learn about fascism (ie - the people who type """"fascism"""" into wikipedia);

A) what fascism is outside of boogieman cartoon depictions. Devotion to such anti-educational, anti-scholary stances on the part of Cberlet has already made this article decidedly inferior to every other encyclopedias coverage.
B) that Fascism considered itself a Third Position on the political scale, not """"far right"""", with its roots actually in defected members of the Italian Socialist Party (such as Mussolini himself) and anarchists such as the anarcho-syndicalists; not as berlet claims """"far rightists"""". This is a particularly inconvient truth for Chip Barlet who depends on the presenation of fascism as right wing, so that in the United States he can attack followers of the Republican Party. Concepts irrelevent to the entire rest of the world. If fascism is not rightist, Berlet's world crumbles to dust. 
C) the history of fascism, how and why it came about after WWI (Treaty of Versailles, Italy's transition from regionalism to nationalism), what happened in practice, who its intellectuals were, what the Philosopher of Fascism Giovanni Gentile's reason and idea for opposing liberalism and democracy was; the latter is perhaps the most striking by modern considerations and the reader will be wanting to know """"why would these intellectuals think this?"""".
D) Berlet would like to build a collection of names of what fascism """"opposes"""" and stack them all up in the intro. but he refuses to allow what it stands in support of and why; for example he removed the references to national syndicalism and corporativsm from the intro, absoutely essential pieces of this political system. He removed the reference to The Doctrine of Fascism and he removed the section which presents that it is hotlt disputed exactly which movements are and are not fascist apart from the National Fascist Party of Mussolini which is always called Fascist.
E) once again, despite the discussion above with R-41 and myself. Berlet has, against consensus and against WP:CITE entered into the article that fascism is """"race"""" and """"racial"""" orientated, when it has been presented that it specifically is NOT the case and the majority of scholars do not take that line. As racialism belongs to Adolf Hitler's national socialism not all of fascism in general; some scholars such as Jewish writer A.F.K. Organski dispute whether National Socialism is Fascist at all. So to type that fascism is """"racially orientated"""" in the intro is a complete and intentional deception, Berlet is well aware of this and his game is boooooring. That belongs in the intro of Nazism's article, as it already is there.
F) Berlet would like to cover up the fact that the Fascist government under Benito Mussolini waged war on the Mafia, shattering the criminals into little pieces with Cesare Mori leading the way. This is again, an incredibly inconvenient truth for Barlet, because his democratic nation the United States openly collaborated with Lucky Luciano to invade Italy in the first place and then made previously jailed Mafiosi mayors of Sicilian towns after the conquest. 

G) maybe unrelated to Berlet (unless its his other name), but Bobisbob with his IP rather than username, has several times attempted to cover up that Adolf Hitler's movement is called """"National Socialism"""" that is its full and correct title. I presume this editor is a socialist, who wants to distance the use of the word """"socialism"""" from what Hitler called his movement. Well tough luck son you can't go back and rewrite",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Super Mario RPG lists 

You asked why List of locations in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars was redirected to Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars in Talk:Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars. I have restored the list of locations, and we are discussing it on its talk page. Could you please take a look? If you have time, please also look at List of characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and Smithy Gang. Thanks!  

Currently, Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars has two lists pertaining to it (List of characters in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars, and List of locations in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars). User:TTN decided it would be best to merge the lists into the main article and split Smithy Gang into those articles. I recently merged Smithy Gang into the list of chatacters by removing the non-notable characters, and I have asserted that a cameo section in the list of characters is valid, per Wikipedia:Trivia sections and Wikipedia:Handling trivia that uses Alex Trebek#Cameos as a good example. I have suggested that we rename the articles per Wikipedia:Requested moves#Requesting potentially controversial moves to something along the lines of Characters of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and World of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars or Mushroom Kingdom (Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars) just like Characters of Final Fantasy VIII and World of Final Fantasy VI or Gaia (Final Fantasy VII). I believe if these articles are to evolve beyond a non-notable list, they should be renamed. For example, List of Final Fantasy VII locations was merged into Gaia (Final Fantasy VII), because a World article is notable, but a simple list of locations is not. That is why there are other secions of the article to make it a World article. It simply has not been renamed yet.

TTN believes the citations in the development and reception sections of the list of locations, books and magazines, are trivial sources. When I added that the 3D perspective of the game is reminicent of Equinox to the main article, TTN removed it since my souce was """"the opinions of the Nintendo Power player's guide writers"""". Although it was actually Nintendo Power magazine, I do believe a magazine is a reliable source, and I gave a page from Next Generation Magazine which also said the same thing. In addition, I was surprized that TTN said that it was from the players guide, since he claims to own the players guide for the game. He has not verified this, since I asked him for citations in May, """"Could you look in the back of the Player's Guide and tell me what “types” of … Magic? I forgot what they call it in the game … well, anyways, what types of Special Attack or whatever it is (actually, could you find out what it's called?) there are? I remember some vaguely when I owned the guide like “Fire”, “Jump”, “Electricity?”, etc. Could you provide a citation, like the page number with a quote in context?"""" TTN replied that he was going to """"get to it"""" (User talk:TTN/Archive 5#List of locations in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars). TTN claims the player's guide is """"at the bottom of a box that's behind at least five others in a cramped space"""". Seeing that TTN did not recognize that the page was not from the player's guide when I provided a scan of the page in question from Nintendo Power shocked me. However, I have continued to assume good faith by not questioning TTN's honesty.

Per Wikipedia:Consensus#Consensus can change, I have offered five different reasonable, temporary compromises that might integrate my idea with TTN's.
Go over the list of characters so we can delete non–notable characters 
Rename the articles by following the steps at Wikipedia:Requested moves#Requesting potentially controversial moves. 
Cut down the geography section list of locations by cutting it into the regional maps the adventures use when traveling from one to another. I can get pictures and write the fair use rationals, and someone can cut down the text that has no citation and does not allude to other media. 
Write the concept and creation and reception sections for the list of characters

I do admit, however, that openly saying he is a """"crazed lunatic"""" was the incorrect way to go about doing things. I believe in the merits of wikipedia and that it should strive for truth and excellence. There is absolutely no place in the current article about Camping that states science disagrees with his statements. Instead, the only mentions of disagreement are """"As a result, some individuals have criticized him for 'date-setting'"""" and """"they [a ministry] believe his entire method of Bible interpretation is flawed."""" If you would like, I can pen a section about the invalidity of his arguments from a fact-based scientific stance. If I cannot do it, someone most certainly should. Otherwise, wikipedia is no more than a medium for which inaccurate science can propagate through the minds of the public. When looking at a page such as homeopathy's, the second sentence reads """"The collective weight of scientific evidence has found homeopathy to be no more effective than a placebo."""" Do you not think statements such as those made by Camping should get the same treatment? On a final note, 24 hours from now nearly the entire article I edited will be proven nonsense. The second sentence under this text box states """"Encyclopedic content must be verifiable."""" Yet, despite this, the second paragraph of his page states: 

""""He has used Bible-based numerology to predict dates for the end of the world.[2] His current end times prediction is that the Rapture will be on May 21, 2011 and that God will completely destroy the Earth and the universe five months later on October 21.[3][4] He had previously predicted that the Rapture would occur in September 1994.[5]""""

The only verifiable thing regarding these predictions is that they are wrong, yet that statement is nowhere to be found. Tomorrow evening, or Sunday if you wish, please add the sentence """"He was wrong about both of his previous predictions"""" to the opening paragraphs of his page.

Errors on the French Wikipedia
I was just looking at the Nunavut and Liste des communautés au Nunavut and noticed that there were several errors.

The Inuit names for the following places are not the official names. A list of official names can be found here, although the spelling of Igloolik is odd.
Qamani’tuaq should be Baker Lake
Naujatt should be Repulse Bay
Kangiqtiniq should be Rankin Inlet
Akviligjuaq is another name for Kugaaruk
Ikaluktutiak should be Cambridge Bay

The """"Liste des communautés au Nunavut"""" has a link to Inuits Netsilik but they are a group of people rather than a community. Amadjuak, Amadjuak, Nunavut, should probably say that it's a former community. The problem is that I don't speak French and I can't log in due to someone using my username for vandalism prior to the unified login system. Thanks. The highly esteemed  presents the Talk Page!

To whom it may concern,

I would like to express my disgust at being accused of sockpuppetry. The accusation made by ChrisCh is baseless simply because more than myself have pointed out their objections to his extreme censorship of the Padua College wikipedia listing. I would further like to add my anger that a Wikipedia newcomer, Freedomfighter1112, has been indefinitely blocked for expressing his point-of-view. The actions taken by  and subsequently  I feel are actually in violation of Wikipedia's policy of not attacking the newcomers. It should be assumed that, in good faith, that Freedomfighter1112 would hope to assist the Wikipedia community in a positive way; however, with the actions taken by the two users mentioned previously, he/she has been prohibited from being able to accomplish this desire. We must remember that everyone makes mistakes, and mistakes are meant to be forgiven - especially in the case of a person's first edit. I would like to say only once - I DO NOT KNOW, OR HAVE ANY CONNECTION WITH FREEDOMFIGHTER1112 AND THAT THE ACCUSATION OF SOCKPUPPETRY IS BASELESS AND THE INDEFINITE BLOCK PLACED AGAINST FREEDOMFIGHTER1112 SHOULD BE OVERTURNED IMMEDIATELY.

Regarding HeartBreaker, The Original Tribute to Pat Benatar, please forgive me for not fully understanding what makes this listed for deletion. Perhaps it's just a guiedlines issue? But, what speciffically makes any of the other tribute bands listed on the tribute act page any more notable than HeartBreaker to allow those pages inclusion? Is it the formatting? Unfortunately, I am new to the Wikipedia environment regarding editing and possibly need some direction on this? I came across the tribute acts pages and noticed The Iron Maidens, which is a local group with not as long a tenure in the tribute community as HeartBreaker, although definately notable, and they are incuded. But beyond The Iron Maidens are bands whos accomplishments pale in comparison to HeartBreaker. HeartBreaker IS a notable, respected and an acknowledged band of the tribute community as well as being one of the first of local tribute acts to appear in the L.A. area when the tribute phenomenon began during the late 90s, particularily with a female lead singer. That, in itself makes HeartBreaker a pioneer to the community. What other information or details do you suggest including, other that what is listed in the biography which is certainly not insignificant, in order to make this page more or as """"notable"""" than or as any of the other other listed tribute bands by Wikipedia standards, and to gain inclusion? Please advise. I have perused some of the other acts' pages linked to the tribute acts page and see only a few with significant notability, most have even fewer accomplishments and notariety than HeartBreaker, some I've never even heard of and certainly aren't known to our local tribute community, which definately expands beyond just the L.A. area. HeartBreaker has been written about and featured in reliable sources and is known for it's tenure, quality and respected within our tribute community, particularily since we are one of the longest running tributes AND are acknowledged BY the artist to whom we pay tribute, Pat Benatar and members of her band(s). We are the only band of any kind listed in her official web pages and have been joined by significant original members of her band. This in itself lends support to the tribute act pages. The histoy of the tribute act pages specifically points to acts who are joined to play with the artists to whom they tribute and further goes on the list bands on the page. Why is it not acceptable to list HeartBreaker and a biography of information to support the tribute act pages? We may not have as much notariety as The Iron Maidens but we certainly are not insignificant and definately are more notable that some of the listed bands. HeartBreaker was featured in a televised documentary about tribute bands on a major network and has been written about and listed is major publications. How can any of this not be notable when this is in regard to tribute bands?????? Please explain. Thank you.""",0,0,0,0,0,0
7908bec5c6456ce8,"I completely agree with you, we cannot expect aliens to interpret pictures, movies, sound and text the way we do. Even if they would be able to see the same spectrum as us, it remains doubtful if those images will mean anything to them at first glance. However, the point here is to convey information. While we can look at a picture at all wavelengths, it is only in the visible spectrum that information on this picture (patterns and variations) start to appear (at other wavelengths, its blank). An analogy would be satellites using SARs to pierce the cloud cover of Venus and image its surface.   There is little information in the visible spectrum but lots outside of it. If the information is encoded in a digital form (eg: RGB) rather than displayed using our technology, then they will interpret it in colors they can see as this encoding is not relative to a specific spectrum. Still, they should be able to figure out what king of colors we meant to encode in the first place by looking at the probes themselves and the markings on them. I think that the aliens will be able to make sense of this information easily. Regardless, I completely agree with you.

 Citylaugh - another puppet of Deng 

It seems that Superdeng has found yet another puppet to master. User Citylaugh is making edits that seem alot like his work. He reverted practically all my work (along with other users) in the Battle of Budapest article. He began his work in May, totally reverting its current version to some old one. I reverted it back to former one, and the article was left alone for a long time. Now he did it again, identifying me as """"vandal Kurt"""".

anyway:

as SAS ownes the majority stake in arBaltic and a 49% stake in Estonian Air with whome they have a close coopeartion, so it's very likely that these two airlines will go the way that Blue1 already went and join the alliance as Regional Members.

Air One is very close with Lufthansa and fully integrated in Lufthansa's Miles&More; FFP. In fact they are the only fully integrated Airline that is not a Star Alliance member yet. But that seems to be a matter of time.

At the very moment Austrian Airlines ownes a 49% Stake in Slovak Airlines. As the Slovak government is planning to sell off the remaining stake in that airline it is highly likely that Austrian will accquire these stakes. A Star Alliance membership is absolutely possible. 

Silk Air is a fully owned subsidiary of Singapore Airlines. I won't comment on that, as I have never heard of them being a candidate for Alliance membership, but doesn't seem unlikely.

Aegean Airlines and Lufthansa started cooperation last year and according to some statements in the German press both airlines seem to be very interessted in Aegean joining the Alliance.

Luxair has strong ties to Lufthansa and Austrian... might not be joining in the nearest future, but would definitely be welcome in the Alliance

Since you removed Qatar Airways from the list of possible members... It's no secret that Star is really interessterd in Qatar Airways. On the other hand Qatar Airways strengthened their cooperation with Lufthansa, ANA and United last year... they are definitely leaning towards Star Alliance.

They are at least as likely to join Star as TAM or SN Brussles etc. to join OneWorld / Malaysia Airlines to join Skyteam",0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm not sure the OED is particularly helpful here, as it is very slow-moving, and often imprecise, being more concerned (from what I can tell) with describing casual usage than precision usage (and yes, I do have it; micro-print edition; I'd love to have the full-size version, but I don't have that kind of money laying around.

From the OED perspective, there """"isn't"""" any difference at all between these words other than """"jargon"""" never refers to slang.  I think a lot of people would have problems with these definitions.
Anyway, to get back to your real point, if these terms are used more interchangeably in the UK than they are in the US, there is no harm at all in making them more specific/accurate to Yankee (virtual) ears, since there won't be any effect at all on British ones, if you see what I mean.  I think this is especially true in the case of that article because most of the terms are jargon rather than slang (some are of course slangish — """"action"""", """"velcro"""", etc. — but they're in the minority"""").  And it's not that the OED-based usage of argot/patois/lingo would be wrong from an OED-based perspective, simply vague (the meaning of all three words in the the OED is basically """"slang or jargon"""".  -)  Anyway, glad we're not really arguing.

The slogan is """"That's why mums go to Iceland"""" - I just saw an ad on TV. But who is the celebrity? Is it a pop singer?  

Its former pop star Kerry Katona

Maybe that's the slogan they use now, but there is no doubt the slogan they used back in the day was """"That's why Mum's gone to Iceland"""".  

Still is - I went to an Iceland this morning and this slogan is still plastered everywhere (April 2007)

 Copyright issues 

A lot of this article is directly copied from the Iceland website:
http://www.iceland.co.uk/ice/instore.nsf/(websearch)/theicelandstory
as indicated by the fact that there are still asterisks inserted which do not relate to anything within the article, but rather to notes on the original page. Is it possible that Iceland have approved this copy?  

Almost certainly not. If it was, there'd be some WP:OTRS tag on this page or something else saying that it was legit. As it is I've removed it for its blatancy.  

Name change
It's my understanding that the overall name """"Iceland.co.uk"""" was dropped as a result of the dotcom bubble bursting - the suggestion being that associating a company so totally with t'internet around 2001-2 was stock market poison.
Fair use rationale for Image:Iceland Shop Logo.gif

:Image:Iceland Shop Logo.gif is being used on this article. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in this Wikipedia article constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to insure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template. Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page.

If there is other other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on the other images used on this page.  Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you. 

 Iceland International Stores 

I started out on this search knowing, without question, that there was an Iceland supermarket on the road between Mijas costa and Mijas pueblo in the Costa del sol in Spain. While merely """"knowing"""" isn't good enough, it does permit of a longer search and of asking the company about non-UK/Ireland stores.  This is what I was sent by email upon asking the company directly through its website:

I can confirm that Iceland do have a number of franchises overseas. However, we do  not hold this information for these stores here. Please feel free therefore to visit www.overseas.es for further information.

I have fixed the internet address from the preceding paragraph to . Click the """"Store Locater"""" tab and, eventually 4 stores in Spain (notwithstanding the text disclaimer at the top of the page referring only to stores in Tenerife) will appear on a map of Spain.

MTBF has a lot of meaning, but it does not mean the device will last 136 years. All of these misunderstandings are really surprising. And it does not mean that you will not see a failure in home use. Saying you will never see a failure is just dumb.  What does it really mean? It means that one out of every 136 devices will have a mechanical failure every year. Or, equivalently, if there were 1360 devices spinning, then on average, 10 would mechanically fail every year. That is the meaning of 1.2 million hours. But, this needs to be put into context. Infant mortality is not counted, because those devices never were in use. Software failures, user failures, infrastructure failures (brownouts), heat and overheating, and viral or deliberate attacks are not counted either. So, a home user is still going to see the failure every few years. Even with enterprise drives. What the home user should not see is driving the drive to death. It should be built for continuous action of the head, and that action not fail for, on average, 1.2 million hours.   21:43, 9 February 2014",0,0,0,0,0,0

1.  Lycée Claudel:  You are 100% correct.  I realized it five minutes later, when comparing the Elections Canada map of Ottawa South to those of Capital Ward and Alta Vista Ward.  Good revert.

Me, I have more than thirty years in pro audio event production, primarily audio system design and mixing. I worked at McCune 1988 to 1994 which is why I altered that bit about the McCune JM3 active system. Since about 2003, the majority of loudspeakers I encounter in my career are self-powered.

I think Meyer has had a very large influence... he basically owned the live sound market in self-powered speakers from 1994 to 1999, and catalyzed a bunch of other companies to produce competing models.

As it now stands, this article is grossly inadequate and misleading. The 'development' at the centre of a sonata structure is in reality a 'Durchführung'  i.e. a 'leading through' various keys. The word 'development' is a poor translation of this  and has generated a situation in which foolish people analyse a stretch of music not according to what happens in it, but in terms of what this wrong word happens to make them think of. As every German muscologist and textbook knows, the point of a 'development section' is *not* various varietites of 'thematic modification'  it is *tonal and harmonic instability* after the stability of the second-subject key and before the restoration of the tonic. Has no-one actually bothered to listen to what does   and doesn't  happen in the included extract...?!? IT'S MODULATORY, AND THAT'S ALL.

IR Explanation

Blessed morning!

This email is regarding the IR issued for the call I received last October 7, 2010, BP Patrice McKenzie.

That afternoon, I was the only one on the queue and prior to Ms. McKenzie's call, I received a MVI call but MVI was not successful due to previous balance as well as the proof of residency required. And because I was the only one on the qeue, I wasn't able to log out or refresh my system.

During the call of Ms. Mckenzie, the POR pop box came and I informed the SME that time, Mario Raymundo, that I have not informed my customer because I know that it was system glitch. Also because tnere is no active account on the address. I was not the one who released the order but someone from Off Line Services. I endorsed the account to Mario to make necessary adjustments on the account. He texted me at around 1am to inform me that he had already talked to someone from OLS and that no POR is really required for the address so, it was released.

After receiving the QA score, I also sent an email to dispute the score that I got because I believe that I did not do anything that is not in accordance with the business rules.
Here are the reasons why:
1. I was the only agent in auto-in for 1hour and 30mins.
2. I informed my support about the situation and I was approved that there is not need to inform the customer of the POR.
3. There is no active account on the address.
4. I was not the one who released the order.

I don't know what adjustments would be made, but I hope there will be considerations.

Thank you!
God bless!

 Wikimedia blog post 

Hello, everyone.  Trying to be as polite and good faithy as possible here this morning.  I hope I won't be smited for pointing something out again.  The current Wikimedia Foundation blog post is Wikipedia for Schools Project.  The blog talks about how Wikipedia for Schools was born out of SOS Children.  It's a great project, providing underprivileged kids in the Third World with curated, age-appropriate content from Wikipedia.  But when you go to see who wrote the Wikipedia articles about the organization and the program, one can see the all too familiar pattern of editorial dominance by conflict-of-interest accounts.  Two days ago, a big chunk of content was added to SOS Children's Villages UK by User:RWilcox11.  Rainbow Wilcox happens to be Website Content Editor at SOS Children.  No disclosure by RWilcox11, so if that is indeed Ms. Wilcox, the edits are in violation of the Wikimedia Foundation's Terms of Use of this site.  Similarly, on Monday (the day the new Terms of Use went into effect), User:Rory.soschildren was working on the article.  Rory Hughes Social Media Marketer for SOS Children.  In a bit of contrast, User:JamieG01 identifies himself on his Talk page as follows, """"I work for an international children's charity called SOS Children"""", so we can assume this is Jamie Goodland who received """"special thanks"""" in the WMF blog post.  Likewise, User:DuncanHarris identifies on his User page, """"I am entirely responsible for the technical work on the 2007 Schools Wikipedia Selection. This work was funded by SOS Children UK (part of the world's largest orphan charity).""""  And User:BozMo identifies (as Andrew Cates) on his User page with, """"I also worked from 2004-2013 (part time as CEO) for the charity SOS Children.""""

Might I make a recommendation?  Now that the new Terms of Use is coming up on its first week of implementation, maybe someone from the Wikimedia blog staff could make it a point, that whenever they are featuring a person or an organization that has a relevant Wikipedia article, that part of the blogger's responsibility is to reach out to any potentially conflicted editors representing the blog subject, to ask them to self-identify per the new Terms of Use, so that the Wikimedia blog is not inadvertently showcasing violators of the Terms of Use of the Foundation's project.  To do my part, I will be happy to reach out now to Users RWilcox11 and Rory.soschildren, to let them know of this conversation.  (So, it would be nice if it isn't deleted or hatted.) -   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Hey What's Up 

Hey Pink Floyd guy,
I started editing on Wikipedia just to keep my mind occupied, I'm going through deep shit, when I started reading the factual errors and the sick shit like mentioning mortality, dying and suicide on the prognosis section of anorexia nervosa, I started contributing out of altruism. 

Wikipedia occupies the first spot on most searches, for self righteous, incompetent dickheads ( can I say that or am I violating WP:Dickhead?) to claim ownership and disseminate bullshit is wrong, it makes Wikipedia look bad and more importantly people are getting bullshit information. 
There is one particular individual who seems to clamor for attention, his 15 minutes of fame went to his head. All the articles he created are one sentence to a paragraph long. To up his """"look at me"""" count he merely transferred sections that other people created to make it look like an article he started. I read extensively about him, he is a publicity hound and I find his behavior pretty frigging disturbing. Soooo I'm not going anywhere. I just have to cool out with my childish hissy fits and use the WP:Blah Blah and according to WP:Yadda Yadda B.S. 

My life is a bit of a horror show right now, so I might not be able to edit anything after tonight, but don't let a dickhead screw-up what could be meaningful information for other people. Proper knowledge can help people, like your information on Rumination syndrome. Whether or not some dick (WP:Dickhead?) has a college degree or is a physician means squat.

Time for some words Jack the Twat
“I think you will find that this user and User:HampshireCricketFan are one and the same person”

So dickhead what evidence do you have for that remark? None whatsoever, absolutely none. Looking at the comments you leave on others User Talk pages and on other pages around this site it is clear you are one arrogant son of a bitch, completely stuck up your own arse and full of your own self importance. 

“Very surprised to see this here and I would disagree strongly with the view that this page is """"is the most comprehensive page on an English County Championship team"""". Nowhere near: see Yorkshire, for example”

What person lists an article written mostly by themselves? Right, someone of the above mentioned description - an arrogant cock.

It is funny seeing the way you comment other people, talking down to them like you being an admin is of such importance: You the fucking man... not! As if anyone gives a flying fuck. Epic fail Jack, epic fucking fail.

Oh and this is truely exquisite. you claim that Speidel's being a linchpin of the conspiracy cast further suspicion on Rommel, but Neubius, Had Speidel been Known to be a member of the conspiracy he would have been executed!!! Where is your brain? Indeed his very survival would suffice to prove that he scapegoated Rommel, for he had no other superiors to scapegoat.

 First point - it was not only treated as mental illness, but as criminal activity.
 Second point - you should only refer to 'homosexual romance' in the lead if there is a section that deals with 'homosexual romance' in the body of the text, as the lead is a summary of what is in the body, and having ten sources does not count for much unless the terms are unpacked somewhere in the main text.  All these seem to show is that people like Giddens (who is a notable sociologist, but no authority on sexuality, sexology,  LGBT studies in general or homosexuality in particular) use the term.  If there were a link to an article Homosexual romance, which shows the term can be taken for granted, fine - otherwise it needs to be dealt with in the article before it can be inserted into the lead. 
 Third point, my earlier comment about this was made with ironic and humorous intent, because I have only come across the term 'romance' used in this context, at conferences, ironically or critically.  Just because a term is used in sources does not mean that it can be used in the lead when it is not in the text, for example, """"Homosexuals deserve to be executed or tortured""""   """,0,0,0,0,0,1

In my own defense: A man has a right to his opinion. I do feel Timothy Usher is a bigot. I do feel that Jews are screwing up the planet (though admittedly Muslims, by far, surpass the Jews in their capacity to destroy things). Look at history. Only recently has it become the norm to like Jews. That only came about after certain countries (eg America) adopted them as the collective dame-in-distress needing shelter and protection. Sort of the precursor to the chihuahua. Before then, Jews were hated in Europe and America alike..And everywhere else. We all know Jews were once banished from most culturally superior European countries. The only reason why Poland took them in was that they had loads of money. Probably the same reason why Washington panders to the now. Point is, alot of people dislike Jews. I'm entitled to, so long as I don't demonstrate that dislike on articles dealing with the topic of Jews. We don't penalize people for not liking things, do we? His Excellency...
