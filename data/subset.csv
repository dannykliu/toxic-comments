Hi SilkTork.

 Concerning point 1, Milburn is a student, by his own statement on his Wikipedia page, studying philosophy in Lancaster. What could possibly be insulting in saying that he is a student, while I myself have been ... (not relevant)? I expect some respect from someone who could be my own child if not student. 

 Concerning your point 2, please read my talk page, and you will see that rather than insulting Milburn, I have just stated facts. Milburn has been writing to me that he is a """"dedicated"""" and """"experienced"""" editor. Why should this have been relevant to me? I had already told him, in no uncertain terms, that I had left the issue to Stifle to decide upon. Yet, Milbrun kept writing to me that while Stifle was an experienced editor, he was also experienced. All these, in the face of the fact that I had never said him anything to the contrary! I had just said that we, i.e. I and Milburn, disagreed on the issue of the photograph of Michael Foot and therefore it was best if the issue was dealt with by someone else. Why had I to be constantly told things that he kept telling me? Read his messages and count the number of times that he has written to me that I did not understand certain things! 

 What could possibly be wrong with being a student in Lancaster? In point of fact, University of Lancaster has one of the best, if not the best, laboratories of law-temperature physics world-wide. If there are ten great low-temperature physicists in the world, thee of them are in Lancaster (they have over long periods of time had the world records of lowest temperatures ever achieved in laboratory; they were the main figures behind the dilution refrigerator, etc.). No, you are utterly mistaken if you believe that I meant something negative by referring to University of Lancaster - some of my best and most respected colleagues are working there (I even was their guest sometimes ago), one of them also a mathematician of great international standing.

 I hope I have made it abundantly clear that there is nothing disrespectful in my writings about J. Milburn as a person, as well as about his contributions (I simply do not know his and his contributions). I just happened to disagree with him on his tagging this photograph for deletion. That is why I suggested to him, already yesterday, that rather than arguing, we left the matter to be decided on by Stifle. That is all, insofar as I am concerned. It is J. Milburn who has kept filling my talk page with his messages after messages, telling me that I were wrong and that I did not understand certain things. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Traces to the person who leaked the photos of Deathly Hallows 

It seems, that the pictures leaked on the internet help the investigators, because metadata saved in the pictures reveal more information. Also other aspects can help to identify the person.
See this article: http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2104250.ece ( )
This could be getting to the point where there should be a separate article entirely that traces the story of this particular Harry Potter leak, considering it has led to sustained press coverage and lawsuits.  As this seems to be the only full leak of the entire book, negating the need for disambig, perhaps it should simply be entitled Leak of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  
Try not to get ensnared in recentism. While there is still a ton of documentation, there isn't an enormous amount of unique information. We should wait a bit, see if it can't be condensed, and then consider a split.- 
Yeah, I agree with that.  Only if it gets to the point where further legal action is taken or if this person's identity is discovered.  

If there is enough information, this would be an interesting article, but it should report the story of the leak from the beginning to the ending - if there will be one ;) - and background information. It would also shorten the hole article Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows there should be a section where a few sentences describe what happened and then above """"Main Article: Leak of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"""". But I agree with Wafulz, that we should wait.  

 Dealing with inevitable spoilers 

We need a hideable section template.  That way people can post the plot details, but have them hidden by default so people don't have to read them if they don't want to.  (Talk  Contrib) 

Trust me, you don't want to get involved in this type of spoiler discussion. It has resulted in months of arguments on Wikipedia:Spoiler, several Requests for comment, and a requested arbitration case.- 

I think, plot details shouldn't be revealed before the book is officialy released. Wikipedia shouldn't spread illegaly gotten information.  

Considering that some people have quite legally obtained the book before its """"official"""" release, not all the """"spoilers"""" are """"illegally gotten infomation"""".  Perhaps you should put a bit more thought into your comments before you make a blanket statment implying that a large amount of your fellow Wiki editors are criminals.   

No one is advocating that.  T/C 

This might be an idea you could pursue as a broader guideline if you really felt strongly about it but I don't think it should be used in this setting because all of the other Harry Potter book articles simply have a first section titled """"Plot overview"""".

The misunderstanding was based on a believed piece of policy in my head which was that editors do not generally remove CSD tags (especially when they had been tagged by an admin) but clicked on the """"contest this speedy deletion"""" button. Now I admit fully I was wrong, and don't know where I even got the initial conception from. I then added the template to Wily's user page (and as you mentioned I changed the default text). You said that I did not consider the possibility that I was mistaken, when I did (why else would I have asked another experienced editor for advice?) and then promptly realised my mistake and set about fixing the problem. I do believe that this was an isolated incident, based on a single misconception in my mind that led to one or two other non-brilliant outcomes. However, I would ask that you reconsider your decline, especially as I made a good number of reverts over the last day or so, and I believe that I am getting it right a good deal more often than not. I understand if you decline, as it was not an attractive mistake to make, but I do ask that you reconsider, as I believe that it was more or less a one-off with no other related incidents in the near past (that I can see).

 Milton Friedman etc. 

I really don't know what I've done or said to produce the attitude you're taking. You can disagree with what I say, although I personally fail to see how any argument can in the end prevent Klein's inclusion in the Friedman article, and I can be mistaken, as I was in my first reading of the Norberg link, but I don't see how you can take things much beyond that. Nothing in my behaviour has necessitated the kind of personal, unprovoked insults with which you've decided to base this discourse. You do know, I'm sure, that personal attacks are entirely against wikipedia policy, and their especially bad form when done repetively and without just cause. You seem to take things fair to literally, or at least bizarrely you have decided to take that approach. I don't mean literally that people regard Friedman as a god, and having to explain that feels rather odd but I've decided to assume good faith as opposed to the more likely probability that you decided just to be awkward and provocative in your discourse. It is simply that a large number of economists and right-wingers regard Friedman as something similiar to god, infallible and above normal human standards. If its not Friedman, than its classical economics as a whole, which is apparently beyond any external critique. That, I believe, explains much of the absense of any proper criticism of Friedman on what in other respects is a fairly extensive article.

Regarding Klein, you simply don't have a point here, its as basic as that. It it not the place of Wikipedia to judge what is """"right"""" in any particular set of affairs, but to record those opinions which are notable. Klein is a best-selling and well-regarded writer with a reputation for fairly good research, her book was generally fairly widely praised and her criticism of Friedman is one of the most well-known in the contemporary world. It also covers far, far more than Chile. That cannot be dismissed because just because Friedman's supports or, for example, a paper by an institute that is itself the target of criticism from her book. As such, the rights and wrongs of Norberg's critique are fairly irrelevent. Although it could of course be included as a counter to Klein's criticism within the Friedman article, there is no case for using it to justify the actual exclusion of Klein's views. Now I know that a lot of Friedmanite/Friedmanesque etc. economists like to believe that there """"laws"""" of economics are a watertight and natural science and as such they are immune to any criticism that isn't likewise """"scientificic"""", and that presumably hold the same assumptions, but most people disagree.

Just to keep you happy, I'll discuss it briefly here. It has some very good points; for example Norberg convincingly shows there was a free-market trend towards the end of the century that goes beyond Klein's explanations (although the actual area of discussionof Klein's book were the far rarer, radical, fundamentalist reforms of the period, but more on that in a minute), he convincingly argues against Klein's account of events in Argentina and (mea culpa) China, his ridicule of Klein's """"Shock!Shock!Shock!"""" metaphor which I myself found unconvincing (as opposed to most her narrative and arguments) is fairly accurate and he makes a strong defence, in many cases, of Friedman. But his 20-page article is itselfcontains so many of of its semi-accuracies, disingenuous argument and near-falsehoods as to make any suggestion that it """"proves"""" Klein wrong, or even significantly weakens much of her basic arguments, completely ludicrous. I'll just list in no propersome of them since I don't have the time to do anything much else. 
He says she portrays the Chicago School as a place that brainwashed its students, as opposed to it actually being famously open to discussion, whereas actually she gives quite a significant account of its openness to disussion. 
This one's just basic commone sense; he says Klein's Friedman crisis quote isn't from any important paper but a preface to Capitalism and Freedom; the preface to the guysmost important book, he defining manifesto, isn't significant? Tell that to Friedrich Engels. 
He says that Friedman gave the same advice to the Soviet Union, China and Yugoslavia, """"yet nobody would claim he was a communist"""", well Klein mentioned this herself, not claiming he was a communist, but using it as an additional example of his somewhat undemocratic outlook.
His suggestion that the military was in control of the economy at the beginnning and the Chicago Boys didn't have control  until later on is simply false. While Pinochet accelerating his reforms as things went along, while the military held ministerial positions and while some statist tendencies naturally held on some level as they always will; Norberg is really here just selecting any facts he can that might appear disprove Klein's accoun",0,0,0,0,0,0

OK, I'll try to sort through your latest post here. Let me know if I misinterpret something.
First, you specify a theory (axiomatic system), namely ZFC-P+""""P(P(omega)) exists"""". Let's call that T0 for easy reference.
Now you argue that T0 proves the existence of a model (let's call it M1  the 1 because it's not a model of T0, but of a new theory), such that:
M1 satisfies ZFC-P
P(omega) is in M1. Now, do you mean the real P(omega), or do you mean that M1 satisfies """"P(omega) exists""""  that is, that there's an element of M1 that M1 thinks is P(omega)?  I'm guessing the latter  that M1 satisfies """"P(omega) exists"""".
You say """"aleph2 is in the model and is less than or equal to [the cardinality of] P(omega)"""". Again I'm guessing you mean that this is in the model's opinion; that is, M1 satisfies the statement """" exists and |"""".
OK, so going with my guesses thus far, I agree that T0 proves the existence of such an M1. M1 might be, for example, M0[G], where M0 equals  (which is a model for T0), and G is M0-generic for the partial order to add  Cohen reals.

Wikipedia:WikiProject_Drugs
I need to start a project that automates factual changes/insertions (like rambot).  A lot of incorrect information exists in or basic factual information is missing from drug related articles.  This is stuff that can be easily looked up online and are basic scientific facts for which there is no argument over.  The information can be found from several online drug databases including rxlist.com, medlineplus.gov, the official websites of drug manufacturers (they have free, detailed information sheets) and other various websites.

I plan on writing a bot which can automatically 'rip' factual information (which is non-copyrightable due to its factual nature) and create an off-site database.  I will offer this database for free for people to download, so both they and I can work on bots that can integrate the information in articles.

This would require considerable collaboration with the drugs wikiproject people to provide a standard format for all drugs articles beyond the simplistic efforts taken so far so that I can ensure the bot will behave properly and insert information only in a correct manner.

For clarity, this is information regarding side effects, [bio]chemistry, routes of administration, drug names (brand name and genericmy bot will autmoatically look up International Nonproprietary Name, USAN, BAN and other names) as well as other clearly factual things.

A question needs to be raised regarding drug pages, how should they be organized?  The full information sheets on drugs are very large and rather complicated from a lay person's perspective, perhaps it would make sense to integrate full infomration (including the results of studies on it) on a separate """"full information"""" page while keeping the main page a summary?

Wikipedia requires that user-created images be under a free license: one that permits unrestricted reproduction and modification.  However, there is a way around this.

If you want to restrict who can use your images, your best bet is to license them under the GFDL, with an offer to let people use them under other license terms if they ask.

The GFDL is a very awkward license for images.  It was designed around the needs of the emacs user manual, and requires that the full text of the license be included anywhere that material under the license is published, and that any work containing GFDL material be licensed under the GFDL.  This isn't a problem for things as large as websites and books, but it's not practical for smaller things such as posters and magazine articles, and for-profit companies usually don't want to publish their work under anything but simple copyright.

So, by licensing under the GFDL, you let the images be used on Wikipedia and related projects (such as Wikibooks or Wikipedia Commons), on Wikipedia re-users such as Answers.com, and on other GFDL-licensed websites.  At the same time, you make it difficult to use the image in printed works and in commercial projects, giving you some control over who re-uses your images.

Suggested wording for your template:

Excerpt from the book by Grateful Dead Bass Player Phil Lesh:

The unique organicity of our music reflects the fact that each of us consciously personalized his playing: to fit with what others were playing and to fit with who each man was as an individual, allowing us to meld our consciousnesses together in the unity of a group mind.

For us, the philosophical basis of this concept was articulated by the science-fiction writer Theodore Sturgeon in his novel More Than Human, wherein the protagonists each have a single paranormal talent – telepathy, psychokinesis, teleportation – and are joined by a quadruple paraplegic who acts as a central processing unit. The process by which they become one is called bleshing, from a combination of mesh and blend. (Today’s archetype would be the X-Men.)

Now I'm going to put the page back the way it was.  And I'll add this reference to it.

 Well, since we're making a list, individual bootlegs don't need to be notable themselves, but I know what you mean, we need some standards for inclusion. As with the sketchy nature of bootlegs themselves, we need to make sure we included only actual bootlegs (I mean """"bootleg"""" in the traditional sense of the word). Generally, I would say if we can find enough information to write a short paragraph or so on it, then let's include it. Most of the sources for this information is going to be found on personal sites of collectors and not really verifiable, so I would say for every inclusion we should have at least two independent sources.

I'm not sure if you have another account, but user pages are supposed to be a little blurb about yourself to identify you with Wikipedia.  They're not supposed to be for holding articles about people.

Wikipedia has a couple policies that prohibit what you're doing:
Wikipedia is not a free host or webspace provider, and it should not store personal homepages.
Articles on people must be notable, or risk deletion

If you wish to store personal stuff, then you shouldn't use Wikipedia for it, since Wikipedia is an online encyclopedia.

If you want to make a wiki site for a club, you might want to use wikicities instead. -|✍ 23:42, 24 Apr 2005 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0

They lie about EVERYTHING! EVERYTHING! And they always get away with it.
For example, my sister threw a shoe at me, it slammed into my face and she claimed it hit me in the stomach. How the crap would she know? She wasn't the one that got hit.
Anyways, when they lie they do get away with it. Which is why I'm going to answer this question now. 

Girls lie so they don't have to get in trouble, girls hate getting in trouble and then they rebel when they get grounded and a lot of fighting goes on. Also they'd always rather have their friend or another person in trouble but them. So take this for example, Tashya (made up the name) does something bad. And she knows she'll get in trouble for it. So when her mom or dad finds out she blames it on her brother. And her brother gets yelled at and grounded for her fault. Girls also love it when other people get in trouble.

Responding here to SlimVirgin's point about purging of the archives. That stops people gaining accessed to WMF-held archives of the list, but it does nothing about personal copies of mailing list correspondence kept by individual arbitrators. There are some arbitrators who have been on the committee for years (much longer than I was), and if archives are purged then any personal archives they may hold would be the next logical target. There are ways to make that attack vector less vulnerable, though, and purging the archives would ensure that new arbitrators only have access to what they get while on the committee. So on balance, I think purging of the archives is something that should, and likely will, be done. Trouble is, it looks like it is a bit late now, and it also raises the problem of verifying the leaks. How can you verify that a """"leak"""" is genuine if the mastercopy has been destroyed?

 I think the harcourt article is excellent, both because it provides additional context (particular in regards to the '19 and '28 weimar law), and in fact directly agrees to the basic premise of the argument.  It is widely accepted (harcourt, library of congress) that the early laws were targeted directly against the Nazis, and other paramilitary groups that were threatening, and attempting to overthrow the weimar republic. (The government having effectively disarmed by the surrender terms of wwI was unable to control the armed groups engaging in what we today would probably term gang warfare). As late as '32 Heinrich Bruening attempted to ban the SA and SS (see rise and fall of the 3rd reich) (Ironically setting up the situation that enabled the Nazis to legally take control). The subsequent laws enacted by Hitler were to a) rearm the nazis, in particular the private army SAs. 2) ensure familiarazation of  the about to be conscripted public with firearms usage. 3)ensure the  disarm all political opponents, specifically calling out jews.  Harcourt repeatedly and explicitly gives up the game - sure he disagrees with the NRAs use of nazi imagery in modern debate. Yes he says """"the nazi's were not in general pro gun control"""".  Both of those prior arguments are straw men, which do not in any way disprove the core history being argued - the core history which Harcourt specifically and explicitly admits to """"Hitler imposed regulations prohibiting Jewish persons from possessing any dangerous weaponsincluding firearms. The Nazi regime implemented this prohibition by confiscating weapons, including guns, from Jewish persons, and subsequently engaged in genocide of

No (translator machine), but Ok lets try one piece at time. 
I would appreciate if you could show me what can be done in each of paragraphs:

1st paragraph:
Having been the early Brazilian republican period, nothing more than a Army dictatorship, already in 1891 from the unfoldings of the bubble of encilhamento and the 1st naval revolt, the country entered in a prolonged cycle of general instability marked by several rebellions, both civilian as military, which little by little undermined the regime in a such extent that by 1930, in the wake of the murder of his running mate, it was possible for the defeated opposition presidential candidate Getúlio Vargas, supported by most military, lead a revolt.

2nd:
Vargas and the military, who were supposed to assume the government temporarily to implement democratic reforms related to 1891's Constitution, closed the Congress and ruled with emergency powers, replacing the states' governors with their supporters. Under the Claiming of the broken promises of changing, in 1932 the oligarchy of São Paulo tried to regain the power and in 1935 the Communists rebelled, having both been defeated. Using the communist threat as an excuse, Vargas and military preclude elections launching a coup d'état in 1937, formalizing the then dictatorship. In May 1938, there was another failed attempt to take over the power by local fascists.

3rd:
In foreign policy, the success in resolving border disputes with neighboring countries in the early years of this period, was followed by a failed attempt to permanently exert a prominent role in the League of Nations, after its involvement in World War I. In World War II Brazil remained neutral until August of 1942, when the country entered in that war on the allied side after suffer retaliations undertaken by Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy, due the country have severed diplomatic relations with them in the wake of Pan-American Conference. With the allied victory in 1945 and the end of the Nazi-fascist regimes in Europe, Vargas's position became unsustainable and he was swiftly overthrown in another military coup, being the Democracy """"reinstated"""" by the same army that had discontinued it 15 years before. Having returned to power democratically elected at the end of 1950, Vargas committed suicide in August 1954 amid a political crisis.

Binksternet it seems that you completely missed my point. This isn't about """"image philosophy"""" or details, or anything like that. You seem to be confused as well with the notion that articles are also supposed to serve as photo galleries, to which they are not. Its an encyclopedia article. Again, if they want to look at pretty pictures, there are plenty of other places online where they can view them. San Francisco's skyline has undergone many changes in the last 5 years and its dishonest, changes that have been mentioned in other wikipedia article, and not to show that to people looking up information on the city and show them a instead 8 year old photo just because it """"looks prettier"""".
As i'm mentioning yet again, I don't see why we can just settle for now until someone goes and takes a different picture. If any of you lives in SF, or the Bay Area, can't you just take some time out to go up to Twin Peaks and take a photo if it is bothering you so much? The weather is perfect for it.

 Smile! 


Smile a little, smile a little, all along the road;
Every life must have its burden, every heart its load.
Why sit down in gloom and darkness with your grief to sup?
As you drink Fate's bitter tonic, smile across the cup.

Smile upon the troubled pilgrims whom you pass and meet;
Frowns are thorns, and smiles are blossoms, oft for weary feet.
Do not make the way seem harder by a sullen face;
Smile a little, smile a little, brighten up the place.

Smile upon your undone labour; not for one who grieves
O'er his task waits wealth or glory; he who smiles achieves.
Though you meet with loss and sorrow in the passing years,
Smile a little, smile a little... even through your tears!

Quoting Hoppe first; Detailing Kinsella's important points
At this diff I put in the """"Democracy"""" section Hoppe's earlier comment first and followed with more about what Kinsella said, i.e.,:
Stephan Kinsella writes that Hoppe's critics have accused Hoppe of """"homophobia, bigotry, and the like"""" based on these passages. Kinsella wrote that that Hoppe's discussion of """"physically removing"""" homosexuals and other groups only applied to """"private, covenant-based communities"""" centered around traditional values. He shared a letter Hope wrote to him saying """"the gay couple down the street who mind their own business would not be expelled, but only those who are openly hostile to the basic heterosexual or private property basis of society.""""

None: Beefart replies

Thanks for you comments. Few take the time to discuss grammar on Wikipedia and it shows in many articles. I disagree with you about 'none'. The word comes from the Old Norse ne an, which means, literally """"no one"""". In my view, to get the sense of any usage of 'none' we must expand it in our minds to """"no one"""". It is impossible to say """"no one are dinosaurs"""". It has to be """"no one is a dinosaur"""". Here are two examples from the OED: (E.J. Howard): Except for her eyes, none of her features was remarkable. (P. Rose): People sought her... but none was a companion. HOWEVER, the plot thickens, because the OED also gives this example from Graham Greene, who is highly regarded as a writer: None of our wives are invited. This flies in the face of the first two examples and suggests that the OED has given up the fight. Maybe I ought to as well ) ). There are of course some situations where expanding """"none"""" to """"no one"""" does not make any sense as either a singular or a plural. (e.g. None of the increase is due to...). Here the best we can hope for is to propose that """"none"""" is a synonym for """"nothing"""".

 0-by-0 matrix 

(I'm starting a new subsection to distinguish my comments from the previous unsigned section.)

Because of the connection with linear transformations, it is important to allow 0-by-n and n-by-0 matrices.

In response to MattTait, the determinant of the unique 0-by-0 matrix is not 0, but 1.  There are several ways to see this:
If one defines the determinant as a sum over permutations of products of entries, there is one permutation of the empty set, and the corresponding product is the empty product, which is 1.
If one wants the computation of determinants by expansion by minors to work on nonzero 1-by-1 matrices, the determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix must be 1.
One can also compute how the corresponding linear transformation multiplies 0-dimensional volume.
The determinant of a block matrix 
A 0
0 B
is the product of det(A) and det(B).  For this to hold when A is 0-by-0 and B is a nonsingular matrix, one must define det(A)=1.   

 Order of a matrix 

I don't think this use of """"order"""" is common in current mathematical literature.  To me, a matrix of order 3 would more likely be a matrix M such that M^3 = I.  I think it is better to stick with the standard terminology """"dimensions"""".   

 F^{n x m} 

I think it is more common to write , not , for the space of m-by-n matrices with entries in F.  (I do understand that it is in bijection with linear maps from  to .)   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

In my opinion, the deeds (kamma)and its effect of an individual, being completely irreversible, are stored in the collective memories of others. They pass on to others and future generations through social and biological mechanisms ( books, heridity, stories, fables etc). For e.g. Hindus and Muslims are still warring because of bad deeds of Muslims committed 1000 years ago. Thus there is no need for any etheral means for transfer of kamma from one generation to another. the rebirth concept is not necessary for the transfer of kamma. Anyways atleast one thing is certain that the same person never takes re-birth again. Kamma may recoil on the doer ( if i kill, i may get killed through revenge) or it may have an impact on others ( if i take a bribe, my children will have to suffer social stigma) or it can have effect on the future generations ( if i harm the environment mindlessly, future generations will not get clean water/air). It is not necessary that in all cases the deed kamma bounces back to the doer. Still the Law of Kamma is sufficient for maintaining the moral order as the key learning is that all actions will leave an impact which is irreversible.

 Notability Criteria - Clubs affiliated to Västerbottens Fotbollförbund 

Clubs playing in Division 4 and below may not meet Wikipedia's notability criteria.  If you wish to produce a Wikipedia page for your club I suggest that you ensure that you take appropriate measures to emphasise that your club is notable.  This may be achieved by including details of at least one of the following:

1. - club achievements in particular competing in the higher levels of the Swedish football league system (Division 3 and above 1987 onwards / Division 4 and above pre 1987); 
2. - a notable player(s) who has played for the club;
3. - widening the description of the club to include details of other sections of the club (some of whom may have made a notable contribution to their sport);
4. - significant club infrastructure that has been provided or is managed by the club such as an indoor sports hall and all weather pitches;
5. - special contribution to the local community such as clubs serving the needs of ethnic communities;
6. - unique features such as an island location or historic stadium.

Failure to meet notability criteria could result in your page being recommended for deletion.

 Harper's Island

Surviving in Frankenwiki
Okay, I'm back from my latest 24-hour persecution, and I realize how the mediation request merely subjected the article to more """"Thought police"""" rather than encouraging civilized solutions to problems.  My mind is spinning in 100 directions. I really dread any continued judgment by a """"jury of sneers"""" so I doubt I would participate in any forums of that type. Some articles become hopeless chaos, when the masses descend and start hacking with no concept of the topic (""""Harry Potter what?""""). One of the worst hatchet jobs, to any article, was with """"Search engine"""" where the technical details conflicted with the general concept of searching for """"stuff"""" and people kept deleting those excessive technical parts about ranking pages (not unlike avoiding text about Low copy number DNA, fingerprints, or luminol of Italian fruit juice). It was another case of """"too many kooks spoil the broth"""" and hence, that implies a long-term issue: articles need a limited """"roster of active editors"""" to limit meddling, perhaps have an active count, and when a editor abandons an article, then space opens for another editor to join the roster. The current myth that 500 people can be allowed (to """"adjust"""" an article) is what led to the """"Search engine"""" article becoming a wasteland of chaotic text. Again, it boils down to how should a person choose which articles to develop, versus when they are wasting their expertise in mud-pit articles. It might be much better to develop 100 rarely-trampled articles, rather than fight a POV-stampede within a single article.

So what's the next article you want to work up to GA status? I actually LIKE writing footnotes, and finding sources for stuff. I enjoyed finding citations and sources for the stuff in the Horse article last night. Might as well add my services to whatever you're working on next...  | Talk 

Well, given your area of interest, why not American Quarter Horse?  Dlh-Stablelignts has been doing some tremendously good work on Gelding also, and so while the veterinary sections are pretty good, the rest of it could benefit from some additional sourcing, though I did a lot of updating and fixing of what was there originally.  That might be another possibility.  Morgan horse could get there with some SERIOUS work.  Have you looked over the criteria yet?   

 Briefly, I looked them over. I recall that they need lots of citations, in depth and with enough pictures/diagrams to make things easy to understand for the non-initiate. I'm sure there is a lot more. I've got books on the vet or training side of things, but not as many as on horse bloodlines and breed history. You've obviously been working hard on things with the horses, and I figured I'd rather work with you, than have everyone sorta scattered all over working on sixteen different articles. Concentrating on a couple would probably make the work easier and quicker, I would think. Of course, I'm still new at this, but I know my editing is helped when someone else checks over it. Quarter horse might be a bit TOO much, honestly. I'd have to fight hard to not put in all sorts of tidbits on the older horses from before the registry formed... and the history of the controversies behind the registry, and .. well you get the idea. Oddly enough, given my Quarter horse interests, I own Arabians (grins) so I'd love to see the Arabian article make Featured.... but I'm scared to ask how much work that would take! Anyway, now that I've babbled, I'm more than happy to watch you work and help however I can. Certainly don't want to work at cross-purposes.  | Talk 

The internet is my friend on a lot of breed stuff, most """"generic"""" horse books actually are quite poor sources with huge inaccuracies.  The breed registry web sites are often much better (though they aren't above POV, at least four different breeds claim to be the descendants of Bucephalus, which is a wholly unverifiable claim! .  You want an easy job, go to List of horse breeds and take a red link to make a new article.  Most in there are stubs, and need expansion, some are red links that aren't even real breeds (For example, you don't want to see the can of whoopa I open when people start claiming that the """"Egyptian Arabian"""" is a different breed, BTW(grin)) so checking the horse stubs is always a way to find new mischief.  (Somehow I got drug into editing on Marwari horse, don't ask me how.)  I got [{Arabian horse]] pretty much to GA status singlehandedly, but it took awhile, editing it from a disaster of anti-Arabian POV to GA status over a period of several months, learning all the way.  My panic about putting it up for FA (I actually think it's almost there) is more the vandalism patrolling it will entail and the things that the wider world of wiki editors might take issue with (for example, the controversies section, almost all parts of it were inserted to settle some kind of edit war or POV discussion.  It's needed.).  I'm not sure I am ready to put  the energy into watchdogging it so that some idiot doesn't totally screw it up or, worse yet, restart battles that were settled a long time ago.  Equine nutrition is one I started from scratch, and after an initial panic when an admin felt I overdid the copy and paste and slapped a copyviol on it without warning (which gave me a really bad couple of days scrambling to get it finished), I basically had it ready for GA in about a week, with a few contributions from some other editors like

 Naji al-Ali 

Hi Ian,

I noticed you changed the date of birth cited on this page to 1938. What is your source for that? I'm wondering because the Arabic wikipedia article, which this page started as a translation from, cites his year of birth as 1937, while a book I have about him - the one referenced in the article - cites it as 1936. What the book says in a footnote on the subject is """"Sulaiman al-Shaikh - """"The caricature artist Naji al-Ali"""" - in the Kuwaiti magazine al-`Arabi, no. 297, August 1983. Naji al-`Ali saw this date and did not raise any objection."""" While the book is certainly not academic, it's also worth noting that amongst those thanked by the author is Khalid al-`Ali, the artist's son.

On the other hand, on this page Naji al`Ali himself is quoted as saying """"I was born where Christ was born: between Tiberias and Nazareth in the village of al-Shahra in the northern Galilee, and I was expelled from there ten years later in 1948 to `Ain al-Hilwe camp in Lebanon.""""

However, the same site also bases its short biography of Naji al-`Ali on the book I used, and gives the year 1936 for his birth accordingly.

Unless you have a solid source, I think we may have to leave it as unknown.

By the way, that site also shows a pretty cool PFLP poster about his assassination, I wonder could we get permission to use it...

 Lying comes too easily to you Mr.Kannambadi 

Mr.Kannambadi, 

Do you know that your attitude is also an equal put off to those who wish to contribute genuinely to wikipedia, engage in healthy discussions and arguments?  It is obvious that trusting you to be sincere in your approach and thinking you to be respectful of fellow contributors, I come up with explanation, sometimes or many a times in detail about historical events. Mind you the expression detailed in victory and silent about defeats was the one given not by me but by you to Nishkid. 

Also, do not resort to blatant lying on these pages (which you are clearly doing, first by saying that I have no sources - be realized that others can also read and write - and second, you are deliberately with malafide intentions creating a misimpression in wikipedia that I was banned for abusing and lack of sources. Be informed that it was neither of those reasons, because the first time I was blocked by Blinguen, it was completely and absolutely without any reason and the second time Blinguen came into my page, he did not express any objections to my contributions or changes to the Chola page, but first he commented that he is blocking me for he thought my contributions were my personal opinions and because he blocked me, he first of all did not engage in any discussions with me or try to explain as to how to make postings in the right manner (though I had indeed sourced the material properly but had not referenced the same) with the result that I got blocked before getting to discuss or even adding the necessary references or citations.  But it is good, this way you are only exposing yourself displaying your lack of spirit of accommodation.

I think I have put it as succinctly as one can, but what can you do, you will go on yapping I am writing detailed messages and creating confusion and what not?  Do you remember the manner in which you so very contemptuously retorted upon my providing even the weblinks like visitchitradurga.com, unnecessarily resorting to instructing about keeping one’s patriotism under control…. That is the problem with people like you, when people give reasons you come up with such unhealthy excuses, when people want to discuss history instead of talking about sources and citations, you tell them to keep their patriotism under control or start alleging that what we try to contribute are devoid of sources or are straightaway our personal opinions. How wrong can you be?  Well, that’s how some people like you are in this world!!!

So your way is pretty clear; either avoid any discussion, remove postings and contributions or cry and complain behind the back, get people blocked and start blaming them by speaking and spreading all sorts of lies.

The next time you want to speak about somone abusing, pl. recall with all vigour in what manner you retorted to Mahawiki - you told him first not to """"soil"""" your talk page (what language and choice of words!!! and then you told him to go get the book by S.Kamat from a good library because you said such a library exists near your home..... if those are not insults, abusive manner of speaking, then what is.... but poor you, when I asked you to go and read Ancient India by either Roychowdhury or Sastri, you start looking out of the balcony!!!!!!

tsk tsk..

  

 Who is a vandal, Mr.Dinesh Kannambadi 

Do not accuse others of being vandals.  Because Ninlil's intervention did not seem partial to you, you have resorted to getting the page 'blocked from edits in the garb of it being an FA category (howsoever inaccurate' by Yellowmonkey.

Now whom should the question be asked: whether it is appropriate to mention the demise of the Cholas along with the demise of the Chalukyas, when it is clearly known to everyone that the Chalukyas first remained without a capital for over 30 years up to 1160/65 and finally demised in 1189/1192 AD with the Cholas lasting another 9 decades before being routed and finally eclipsed by the Pandiyans in 1279 AD?. This is simply because there is no relationship between the demise of the two kingdoms, the Cholas did not cause extinction of the Chalukyas or vice versa. The demise of the Chalukyas does not deserve mention in the Chola page because even though the Cholas existed, but mainly because the Chalukyas were consumed and finally eclipsed by their local rivals in Kannada country as well as by the Kakatiyas.  Then what could be the reason for mentioning the demise of the Cholas, when it was the Chalukyas who demised many, many years before them? Is it some sort of a new version of history that is being sought to be told and spread to unsuspecting visitors to these pages?

Mmmm, this is a tricky issue. The debate as I see it is between providing a useful article for readers desiring information not otherwise contained in Wikipedia, and providing something basically inaccurate. For example, Brooklyn Beckham (the son of footballer David Beckham) was deemed not notable enough to merit his own Wikipedia article. Hence the link from Brooklyn Beckham redirects to the """"Personal life"""" section of his dad's article. Not strictly accurate, but probably the most useful link for people who want to know about Brooklyn. In the absence of an article about Gadara (Umm Qais), if there was no other article related to Gadara, the same might apply to the redirect to Legion (demon).

I am new to Wikipedia but seek to make sure the informamtion is correct.  According to BPL (SIC?) rules any information that is unsourced or of a dubious source is to be removed.  In the article Jung Myong Seok I take issue with citations 11, 12, and  13.

11 Is attributed to a French sociologist Ms Nathalie Luca.  Problem is the citiation page does not support the claim that JMS was a member of the Unification Church. Additionally there is an out of place British flag on the top of the citation page which does not fit CNRS country of orgin- France. Therefore,  I do not only doubt the authenticity of the citation but it does nothing to support the claim made in the body of the article.

12 Citation leads to a link titled Radio Australia with 5 poorly written sentences that describe a supposed historical timeline.  The article has no reference to primary sources AND does not even have a listed author.  It gives me the impression that someone robbed a page from Radio Australia and wrote whatever suited their needs. Furthermore, the information contradicts what was written in paragraph 3 of the JMS article.  Mr Jung was not fleeing justice but was carrying out missionary trips.  The sentence associated with this citation clearly portrays Mr Jung as a criminal on the run.   This is a shameful act of intellectual dishonesty and it is travesty to leave this libelous information posted with an inadequate citation.

13  The citation link is no longer available and can not be used to verify the statement in the body of the article. What accusations reached other countries and why was he investigated by Taiwanese authorities?  The answer is not stated in the wikipedia article but the implication is that he committed sexual assault or some similar crime in other countries.  These 3 sentences( associated with citation 12 and 13) flow with the clear intent to slander Mr Jung without 1 single  properly referenced source. 

Please remove this slander and libel from Wikipedia that the truth may be known.

Machida returned to his native Brazil to face Phil Davis on August 3, 2013 at UFC 163.[44][45] In a unanimous result, Davis defeated Machida via decision.[46][47] 13 of 13 ufc media outlets scored the bout in favor of Machida.[47] Davis had takedowns near the end of rounds one and two, after neither fighter was able to mount any significant offense. Davis mounted significant offense, as it won him the fight. ESPN scored for Davis. Many UFC shills with hall passes that could be taken away and votes on the ufc rankings, but zero in the way of journalistic credentials of any discernible pedigree in journalism scored the fight 30-27 in favor of Machida.[48] UFC promoter, sport hater, and just bleed advocate, Dana White stated shortly after the fight that he had Machida winning all three rounds,[49] and later told Yahoo! Sports that """"Machida definitely won"""" and """"MMA judging sucks"""".[50] Fightmetric Analysis supports this, showing that Machida outstruck Phil Davis, and neutralized 80% of Davis' takedown attempts, with a significantly higher efficiency rating through all three rounds.[51] ESPN released a similar analysis tracking each fighter's activity in each category, and reporting the 29-28 victory for davis.

 Josef Rosch Image deletion 

Hi,
I uploaded File:Josef Rösch.jpg for an article on Josef Rosch. It was tagged for speedy deletion because of some sort of """"copyright infringement."""" However, I replied that not only do I have permission from the copyright owner (Dotter Institute) but that I can provide it if necessary. So, why was the file deleted and how can I avoid getting it deleted in the future?

My plan is actually to use a different, higher quality photo. I also will have copyright authority for this image. What sort of documentation do you want to prevent a deletion? Thanks for your time. 
 You had put an absolute minimum of effort into preparing the image description:
 {{Information |Description = Photo of Josef Rösch |Source = Available online |Author = Dotter Institute |Permission = Evidence: Will be provided on request. }} ==Licensing== Free use for wikipedia.
 Description - could have linked to the article about the guy. """"Available online"""" - disgusting - provide a link to it! """"Will be provided on request"""" - no! - evidence must be provided at the time of upload. """"Free use for wikipedia"""" - hopelessly vague - we need a proper Creative Commons licence. And we definitely want a decent size article instead of the thumbnail you supplied. If the new image is available online and has an appropriate CC licence attached, simply upload it here, point out that the source has a CC licence and reproduce that licence here. Failing that, read this. —  (talk · contribs)

Hi Roger,
I'm contacting you to enquire about the speedy deletion of the article Louis-Modeste Zoubabela Ngabanka II. 
Actually the article is meant to be a biography. Thus, I found relevant to attach references as evidence of actions performed by a person who has quite few followers. 
However, with all due respect to the Wikipedia policy, once any inappropriate content is clearly labelled, I believe your valuable feedback will help improve the article. 
Thank you for your time.
Regards,
Ngabanka II  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

 It is considered the height of vanity to write about oneself. Kindly have the decency to wait until someone with no COI thinks you are notable and writes about you. Another small matter was that the article was in French and this is the English Wikipedia. If you really insist on submitting the article, please do so at fr:Louis-Modeste Zoubabela Ngabanka II - with the © symbol omitted. —  (talk · contribs)

This instrument,   that cost to you and me and to all  taxpayers  2 Billions of dollars is supposed to look for antimatter created in the Big Band . This project was proposed by nobel Prize  physicist  Samuel Ting many years ago, it was controversial and several time Congress tried to cancel the program but could not overcome the lobbying by all the scientists  involved in the project. In the same piece NPR interviewed Professor Gregory Tarle , a physics professor who  said  'This project was a tremendous expenditure of money that was not justified....while the AMS was originally planned to search for primordial  antimatter, recent research show that that there is no way that it will find any"""".         
This physicist is from the University of   Michigan    and I am sure, people working with  Ting or other scientists  who were on the salary to built the machine , considered this man a kook, a subversive and tried to discredit him in any way. Do you think that if he now goes to the lab where the machine is built he is going  to get a job? Do you think that when you go to a professor who is the recipient of  a grant on a specfic subject and you tell  him that the subject he is studying has some alternatives and that he is basically studying an old theory and there are alternative ones, that professor will just tell you that you are great and that   you deserve a piece of the pie? Don't  you admit the possibility  that  he  is going to discredit you and send your work to a friend who is going to write a report....and do you think that that report is going to be  in support of the new alternative so his friend loses his grant? 
I am not sourcing this since it is a discussion on a different subject and it is very easy to find on the NPR site , however it is very pertinent to the discussion about Santilli saying that he was opposed....that is a normal event and if Santilli talked about this opposition is he  a kook and a fringe and should he  publicly disparaged???

89d81c929bdc173a,"Cornea Transplant Surgery

An eye is considered to be one of the most important part of the human body. Eyes are organs that perceive light and forms a communication with the brain providing all the necessary data. The brain then processes the raw data and acts accordingly. An eye is a complex component of the human body comprising of various and sensitive minute parts. A transparent front part of the eye that acts a protection shield for the iris and pupil is cornea. Sensitivity, transparency and presence of immune cells make cornea a very special tissue. Cornea transplant surgery is an operational method in which a damaged cornea is replaced by donated corneal tissue. It is very much admissible to consult a trained cornea surgeon in India and expert for successful cornea transplant surgeries. 

Corneal Transplantation

Corneal transplantation surgery, a process in which damaged corneal tissues are replaced, is also referred to as corneal transplant. It is one of the most successful organ transplantation surgeries in the world. Replacement of cornea can restore completely or partially lost vision, reduce pain and improve the efficiency of cornea. Also known as keratoplasty, the transplantation surgery is considered as successful sight saving operation for improves the optical quality of cornea. Some of the conditions that might require cornea transplantation include malfunctioning of cornea’s inner layers, keratoconus (bulging or change in shape of cornea), swelling in cornea and tissue growth in cornea. Occasionally corneal transplantation surgery is combined with various refractive surgeries, cataract surgeries and many such surgeries. Owing to technological developments and medical advancements, the number of corneal transplantation surgeries in India has increased subsequently providing sustained protection from cornea diseases.        

Donor Corneal Tissue

Corneal transplantation includes replacement of damaged or diseased cornea by donor corneal tissue. A thorough evaluation of donor cornea is essential for the success of corneal transplantation surgery. Due to latest inventions in the field of medical science, today a single donor cornea is divided into 3 parts and is used in different patients for improving visual acuity. Detailed screening of human donor cornea during transplantation of cornea ensures successful transplantation surgery. However there are many risks involved in the surgery. These risks are relatively very small but they can cause hazardous effects if the surgery is not done under proper care. Some complications that could occur are bleeding, eye infection, increased sensitivity to light, rejection of new cornea, increased redness of the eye and many such dangerous complications. Hence it is always advisable to consult a cornea disease treatment specialist for successful treatment of cornea disorders.
        
Recognized eye bank in India and renowned centre of cornea disorder treatment offers keratoplasty, keratoconus, corneal edema and cornea transplantation surgery in India.

Contact specialist cornea surgeon for treatment of various corneal disorders through advanced methods.

Since Hkelkar won't stop reverting my edits, why does this page insist on going by the loaded terms of the past and writing """"Islamic terrorism"""" and """"Islamic militancy""""? Any educated person should know that Islam is a religion, and the militants fighting in these two countries are both fighting for nationalist causes. Think of Kashmir in 1900: There were Hindus and Muslims living with one another. There were no wars being fought. Then, after the partion, which created nations, there suddenly was a militancy problem. Same exact scenario in Israel. Thus, these insurgencies or resistances or whatever you want to call them can not be claimed to be Islamic, when these two regions clearly had Islamic culture and Muslims from hundreds of years prior without terrorists.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 CSP is server-side (has to be configured at each server, sends reports to the server), while ABE is client-side (configured in browser, logs results in error console).
 CSP just allows or blocks content, whereas ABE can take other actions like stripping authentication.
 CSP was primarily designed to stop cross-site scripting and other injections, while ABE was primarily designed to stop cross-site request forgery (but can defeat XSS/injections too).
 CSP allows wildcards, ABE allows either wildcards or regular expressions.
 CSP specifies only hostnames, ABE can specify full addresses including protocol and path.
 ABE knows about intranet vs internet addresses and can control traffic between them (in fact, it does this by default).
 CSP doesn't try to control requests originating from privileged code eg browser extensions. ABE can, although it is always possible for privileged code to defeat this, so it cannot be relied on to protect against malicious addons.
 ABE can distinguish between different types of object inclusions and different HTTP methods.
 They can work independently; if either blocks something, it will be blocked.
 I don't know of any metrics on how widely CSP is deployed, nor do I have any idea how many NoScript users take the time to configure ABE (which doesn't do very much out-of-the-box).",0,0,0,0,0,0

Well, upon reviewing my original post I would like to moderate my original statements because I understand the confusion between the term """"Christmas"""" and the related practices.  It is my belief that we must clarify in the minds of laypeople(and people of other cultures) that Christmas is a commonly used term, often commercial, sometimes secular and used to apply to all seasonal celebrations, i.e. """"state Christmas tree"""", when in fact the united states government is not affiliated with any particular religion.

I would like to insist that the opening paragraph is highly bias and simply incorrect as it stands now:

1) Defines the Christian history of a celebration
2) Brief history
3) Anecdote
4) Note on the fallacy of placement of the celebration
5) Secular statement, as though the """"Christmas tree"""" and """"Santa Claus"""" are secular in origin, which they are not.

The way to fix this is to separate the term Christmas from the seasonal celebrations in the minds of readers.  Christmas is a commonly used religious and secular term first.  Second, it is a Christian celebration of a Jewish man's birth. 

Revised suggestion:
1) Define Christmas as a commonly used term
2) Christian definition of the celebration
3) Brief history of celebrations 
4) Note on the Christian placement of the holiday
5) Accurate attribution of Christmas, brief origins of 

Proposed pp:
Christmas is a """"[Christianized] term"""" for a traditional holiday practiced by many cultures throughout the world; the term is often used in a secular and commercial capacity. Christmas (literally, the Mass of Christ) is a holiday in the Christian calendar, usually observed on December 25, which celebrates the birth of the man, Jesus Christ.  The first Christmas celebration took place in Rome about the middle of the fourth century. The exact date of the nativity is not known, but the period from December 25 to January 6 — now known as """"The Twelve Days of Christmas"""", is traditionally a time of celebration for many cultures throughout the world.

Additionally:
I would like to ask that all references in the article precisely identify that """"Jesus"""" is Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ.  My Christian friends should also support this request, as my Mexican gardener is also named Jesus and I am left wondering which Jesus you are celebrating, lol.

Attachment theory
Hello, I've noticed the general subject are of your edits and wondered if you might want to look at my new article Attachment theory and give it your touch - don't know if it is something you know about.

Also, as I happened to look at your contribs I saw you had done some work on brain imaging.  I've been wondering recently about why it is that we routinely X-ray people for internal physical problems but rarely brain scan people with behavioural difficulties or mental illness.  Am I right in assuming it's largely a matter of cost?  

As a sufferer of mental illness (clinical depression and with a bipolar family member) it would almost be a relief to me to be able to see something on a picture and go """"there, that's why I'm different"""".  Of course, I realise little is understood - but that would improve if imaging of ill people were widespread.

False. You have not given even ONE valid example of that. I doubt you would be able to understand what the physics is about anyway.
You cannot produce even ONE objective valid refutation of any of my physics ideas by anyone. CH saying """"it's nonsense"""" is not objective. It's not valid. It is not rationally argued. No reasons are given. Also I retracted my FTL Communication Idea 15 years ago. Furthermore, making a mistake in physics does not make one into a crackpot! Also, you have suppressed the fact that I predicted the SUPERSOLID decades before it was discovered and before Tony Leggett, who gets the credit published his paper. George Chapline and David Finkelstein confirm that in writing and you have consistently deleted that important factual information from the article. That is hardly fair is it?

2) """"It is also a fact that Usenet is not the usual venue for publishing even highly unconventional ideas in physics.""""

Sez who? That is exactly what Usenet SHOULD be for! INSTANT WORLD WIDE COMMUNICATION OF IMPORTANT IDEAS NOT THE CRAP THAT MOST IDIOTS PUT ON IT. Peer review is a joke in physics today. Everyone in the field knows it. The free market place of ideas is supposed to be the Wiki idea, or am I wrong? Mainstream journals DO NOT PUBLISH UNCONVENTIONAL IDEAS! What planet are you on?

3) Sarfatti has been considered negatively by many since his involvment with paraphysics dating back to ths 1970s, long before the existince of Usenet, for which I have proveided reputable sources (and can provide more). 

STOP RIGHT THERE! You just committed a HATE CRIME! Are you ABOVE THE LAW? So working on paranormal stuff automatically makes one a crackpot? Is that your position? That's like saying it's OK to lynch niggers because they are less than human. Same idea. Think about it. Sarfatti thinking outside the box means he is not entitled to the same respect as someone taking the safe boring path through life. Who are your reputable sources? Show them. Martin Gardner? Show where his exact text justifies your false extrapolation. Also, I do not in 2005 hold to the same ideas I did in 1975! Why focus on 1975 and exclude 2005? 

4) It is also a fact that were it not for his provocative statements and the largely negative reaction to them, Sarfatti would not be in any way notable.

False. I would be notable for several ideas in physics. The quotations by David Finkelstein, Lenny Susskind, George Chapline and Tony Smith prove that. It's OK to say """"negative reaction"""", but it's not OK to LYNCH ME and DEFAME ME with putting """"crank"""" and """"crackpot"""" on a very scant article in such a way that that is the KEY MESSAGE the casual reader will go away from. Now ANY LAWYER will tell you you are treading on shaky ground if you do that and cannot prove your case should it ever go to court. This is NOT a threat. I am on several TV shows and I am in Paramount Pictures Star Trek. That does not make me notable. I am cited in several popular books. That also makes me notable. For example, Herbert Gold's book Bohemia, not to mention The Dancing Wu Li Master that I ghost wrote most of  for Gary Zukavand that sold a jillion copies and is still selling after 25 years. My original Space-Time and Beyond sold fairly well also. So look David E. Siegel from Two Independence Way Suite 100, Princeton NJ 08540, your research on me is pure shlock. It's fragmentary and it gives a completely distorted image of who I really am and what I really think and WHY I AM NOTABLE!

5)"""" Now, none of that means that his critics are correct. It is true that many well-known people are strogly attacked, and it is also true that many eventually widely acccepted scientific ideas are considered absurd and crankish early in their history.  (Continental drift comes to mind and there are many other examples.) It is possible (although I belive unlikely) that Sarfatti's ideas will be similarly respected in the future. (Of course that fact that many respected theories were once thought crankish does not alter the fact that most ideas thought crankish are always so regarded  the crank thory that proves correct is a rare beast.)""""

I assign most of the blame to the current US media obsession with targeting the lowest-common denominator of intelligence in entertainment and news programming. I haven't wathced Amercin network news programs intentionally in over 20 years, as they spend 22 minutes on expanded """"personal"""" stories, with litte har """"American"""" news coverage, much less anything else from the rest of the world! I grew up where you could turn on the radio at 3pm, and listen to an hour of BBC World Radio news coverage - now THAT was comprehensive. Don't know if they're still that way or not. Also, US government-run schools are atrocious, and spend little time on world events outside of America's di
direct interaction, and currently most of that is in a purely negative light. So not only do they no nothing of the rest of the world, they think all the rest of the world's problems are our fault! I guess the fall of the various Eqyptian Empires was our fault since the US wasn't there to make it worse! -   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

This block is even more outrageous and illegitimate than the first. You didn't even allow me to say anything; that alone makes this charade illegitimate and unacceptable. The whole essence of Dougweller's argument over the last few weeks has been that article talk pages can and should be viewed in isolation when addressing a dispute. Bbb23 and JamesBWatson agreed with him in this regard and that was the main basis for punishing me for the recent conflict that was started by Mzilikazi1939. Therefore my actions of yesterday constitute complete compliance with the rules and the comments from these two administrators. As was made crystal clear on Talk:Aesop yesterday, Mzilikazi and his friends never complied with the rules set out in WP:ERA in their latest attempt to change the article Aesop. I already tried merely correcting their illegal actions and explaining it in edit summaries and personal talk pages but they continued ramming through their illegal changes, so yesterday, even though corrections of rule breaches should not require discussion, I made the peace-making effort of explaining the matter on the talk page Talk:Aesop.

I went above and beyond what was required in order to see a peaceful resolution to Mzilikazi's edit war and I fully complied with both the Wikipedia rules and the wishes of the two administrators who had judged on the issue. If I broke the rules by obeying those administrators then the first block was obviously not valid and therefore an indefinite block now is not allowed. In fact, any punishment now would not be allowed because the alleged rule breach was entirely due to the directions given by Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, i.e. that article talk pages, as asserted by Dougweller, are meant to be viewed in isolation from other talk pages. My peace-making efforts yesterday were most certainly not a """"diatribe""""; it was a clearly and thoughtfully written explanation of what the issue was, how Mzilikazi's actions breached the rules and even how to resolve the matter. Unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi and Dougweller consistently, I included no personal attacks in my efforts of yesterday. Bb23 made the dubious accusation that I had used personal attacks in recent weeks but I reject that entirely; I never called anyone names and I never tried to rely on ad hominem arguments to """"justify"""" my position, unlike what we've seen from Mzilikazi in particular. Yesterday's edit was completely free from personal attacks; that's undisputable.

The very fact that Bbb23 would describe yesterday's tactful, eloquent, peace-making effort as """"diatribe"""", an extremely strong word, is more than enough proof that he has strong feelings about the issue and, as per WP:INVOLVED is therefore ineligible to participate in an administrative capacity here. This is a breach of the same policy that User:EncycloPetey broke when he banned me years ago, causing him to be stripped of his administrator status. I was already wondering how Bbb23 could block me the first time with that non-sensical, contradictory excuse for an explanation.

If article talk pages aren't meant to be viewed in isolation then both Aesop's Fables and Aesop are meant to be using the standard English style of dates. That is what I originally insisted but for that I was blocked by Bbb23. However, if, as asserted by Dougweller and agreed to in the rulings of Bbb23 and JamesBWatson, article talk pages are meant to be viewed in isolation then Aesop's Fables is a lost cause and Mzilikazi has got away with his change there but Aesop is still meant to remain in the BC/AD state. Yesterday's edit is in complete compliance with that ruling and I even made the additional effort of explaining it on the talk page to ensure that I could not be successfully accused of making trouble. For anyone who reads what I wrote at Talk:Aesop yesterday, there can be no doubt that not only did I comply with the rules yesterday, but I even went out of my way to work towards ending Mzilikazi's conflict peacefully and in accordance with the proper procedures.(  )""",0,0,0,0,0,0

As I've noted previously, the citations given for rap metal repeat links sourced later in the article. The reason that punk rock had been given as a genre was because it was the most commonly used term given in articles about the band, rather than rap rock, a term that is not used by the band. While it has been argued that Rolling Stone is a stronger source than some of the others, it should be noted that these reviews were written, as previously noted, during the period in which the band was signed to a major label, when the band received more coverage than it has while recording and releasing albums independently, and sources agree that the majority of the band's works (its debut EP, debut album, and all independent releases) reflect a punk influence, rather than a metal influence, and most certainly the band's most recent work is considered to be punk-influenced. Thus, taking into consideration that the majority and most recent of the band's works is considered to be punk rock, I feel that this is the genre that should  be given in the lead.

I can certainly handle that ) I was thinking of your """"stress"""" talk/post from a while back, I also pretty much quit editing after some highly fatiguing moments last year (in which I eventually prevailed through arbitration); on pages where you'd never have expected arguments! I am bilingual and binational in Canada, which makes my cultural sensitivities and awareness a little over the top. Add arrogant Frenchmen into the mix and it makes editing French pages extremely litigious and the same vein as certain brit/american/auz litigations on language use. Some days I think that each language wikipedia needs to invent a country/region specific tool because endless regionalisms in a single intro is heavy. Another source of litigation is overuse of internet references, often these pop culture science sites are rife with distorted or misinformation, for internet references I like to limit it to webpages which are themselves well referenced or science organizations vs virtual non contactable entities (of course, as an overeducated scientist, mostly I mean in context of scientific notions) or media pages (I distrust these most).

If an Ori ship is piloted via a control chair like Ancient tech is does that mean that priors have the Ancient gene, meaning that O'Neill or someone else with the gene could fly it or is it only pilotable by people with powers of a prior?

 

There are many genes to choose from, and it is highly unlikely that the Ori chose the same one as (or one directly compatible with) the Alterans. The priors are tampered with so much, and they have telekinetic and other mental abilities, and piloting probably requires a number of those powers.

I improved the article by changing the name, which no one seemed to like. Obviously, one should then change the name of the AFD to correspond to the article. For you to call that disruptive demonstrates a profound misunderstanding of the process.  If I had changed it to something silly, that would be different, but I doubt there's an editor here who disputes that was an improvement.
Second, I did not attack Aaron in it, I described his actions. I factually said he did not do a, b, & c. I also described it as a preposterous attempt to circumvent standard procedure. It was. Honestly, I've been around for years, and I've never seen anything remotely like that nomination. Now, I don't think he's trying to make a point, I think he's dead serious and that's the scary thing. I also don't think the others are trying to make a point; I think they're abusing process. Morton is handing out freaking barnstars to the little coterie that votes with him. How is _that_ less offensive than me making links to contributions. The fact is that everyone here does look at contributions by certain people, and I'm just not so fake as to hide it.

I do have an intention of participating with well-reasoned commentary on the same AFD's based on the same sources they use.
Third, I did not _evade_ the block in any substantive way. I simply left a message on your page. Did I go mess with Scribner? Did I go edit? No I did not. I simply asked you to explain your absurd comment that _I_ had disrupted AFD.

Greetings & question
Hi, Oda Mari. Long time no see. I hope all is well with you and that you're having fun editing. I've stopped editing here and moved over to a Japanese film-specific wiki. (There are several reasons for my departure. The main one is that I believe, Wikipedia's """"notability"""" criteria makes all non-English, non-mainstream film articles easy targets for deletion, unless they have been extensively written about in English.) Unfortunately, so far, the editors only consist of a native English-speaker (myself), and (I believe) a native Czech-speaker. So, with no native Japanese-speaker, we sometimes have to wrestle with the Japanese language a bit ;-) A question has come up at:

 Hi there 

My block expired a few hours ago and I wanted to ask you if you had the chance to review the case. As I understand it I was blocked for WP:NPA after stating several times the editor Wee Curry Monster was making """"untrue statements"""" purposely misrepresenting my comments. Prior to that I addressed them as """"lies"""" but after I was advised not to do so (in the last ANI) I stopped. I see now that """"untrue statements"""" isn't acceptable either. Fair enough I shall not use the word """"lies"""" or """"untrue statements"""" again. Now this raises the obvious question: what should I do when this editor purposely makes a misrepresentation of comments/facts in a discussion? I can present the evidence for this editor doing so quite a number of times (I actually did at the last ANI). I'd have no problem in assuming good faith if it weren't for the fact that he never once either apologized or acknowledged having done so. What should I do as an editor when another editor behaves like this over and over again?
Also, if you have the time could you please drop by the talk page Talk:Falkland_Islands_sovereignty_dispute and the ANI report and tell me if you believe editors Wee and Kahastok are properly interpreting the discussion as to give them consensus to delete the whole section from the article?

 Regarding References Cited 

Thanks for the heads up.  The reason I changed all those headings was because of the following message left after some of my work:
""""This article includes a list of references, related reading or external links, but its sources remain unclear because it lacks inline citations. Please improve this article by introducing more precise citations where appropriate.""""
This implies since I did not do in-line citations that the source material remains unclear and uncited, which is not true, though I understand Wikipedia's policy for standardization.
I do politely disagree that the word """"reference"""" by itself implies internal citation.  It does not.  Many professional journals' ending sections say """"References Cited"""", because """"References"""" by itself could mean simply works used but not cited anywhere.  That is, it is a """"referral"""" to the actual work.  Thus I did not see it as vandalism, but rather, as clarification.

How did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? 

Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant """"to knock, as on a door"""" up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like """"you're"""" and """"your"""", for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier """"gay"""", just as there is no need to call men having anal sex """"gay anal sex"""", but that's really irrelevent. 

I think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. Even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake, """"splash"""", from Japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything, but specifically semen and specifically onto a person's face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it, but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it.

 Timeshifter's dishonesty 

Timeshifter, your story above is text-book projection, first rate water-muddying, I grant you, but deceit nonetheless. But this follows the pattern of your edits. Your POV is clear throughout. It's pretty simple: you believe this recent Lancet study is the Truth, and, therefore you have to believe that virtually all other sources are way off. IraqBodyCount is a wild underestimate, ILCS is not """"legitimate"""" etc. Basically every edit you've made on all these pages is carefully orchestrated and loaded to lead everyone toward these beliefs. Now you're pissed that I've ever so slightly gotten in the way of your prolific POV-pushing by deleting a miniscule fraction of it, and now you're playing the victim. 

Let's put that act aside and look at what I've actually deleted. I've reverted basically three things here: 

1. Lancet page - claims about a supposed """"ILCS baseline 2002 mortality rate"""". Fabrications do not belong on wiki pages. I deleted that fabrication. The only """"sourced material"""" I deleted was stuff about Lancet baseline rates that were cited accurately enough, but only had any relevance to this section because they were being related to the fabrication I was removing. Once the fabricated """"ILCS baseline rate"""" is removed, the surrounding """"sourced material"""" from Lancet that I deleted no longer has any relevance to the section. It is entirely out of context and so properly removed along with the fabrication. The """"sourced material"""" that was there makes no sense being there unless the fabrication is there, so I removed it along with the fabrication. 

2. IBC page - I deleted an inaccurate and out of context claim authored by Timeshifter. I added a statement which says IBC showed an example of something, and provided a citation for this. Timeshifter then adds that Lancet authors dispute this claim from IBC, and he puts a footnote onto this, but the footnote leads to quotes by Lancet authors that address something else entirely. Thus, this claim of Timeshifter's is properly removed as it is falsely described as one thing when it is something else, and the citation leads to something that is different than how it's described. 

So the first two are just simple falsehoods and fabrications. Apparently it's """"against the rules"""" and """"POV-favoring"""" to delete POV-pushing falsehoods and fabrications.

3. IBC page - Guatemala study. I've questioned the relevance of this to IBC, and the accuracy of the description, and discussed this on the talk page. This one is at least more debatable than the others, as it is just tangential cherry-picking for a POV, rather than just fabrications and falsehoods for a POV.

Deleting these three things has been my great crime, causing poor Timeshifter so much pain and anguish, yeah right. As I've already said, I can't keep up with Timeshifter's proselytizing for the Lancet study on all these various pages. He's very commited to the cause, as proselytizers tend to be.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

But there are myriad abuses and problems that never make it to mediation, let alone arbitration. A few of the project's participants can be, not to put a nice word on it, pretty nasty. And this is tolerated. So, for any person who can and wants to work politely with well-meaning, rational, reasonably well-informed peoplewhich is to say, to be sure, most people working on Wikipediathe constant fighting can be so off-putting as to drive them away from the project. This explains why I am gone; it also explains why many others, including some extremely knowledgeable and helpful people, have left the project. 

The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problemor I, at least, regard it as a problemwhich explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist (which would, in this context, mean excluding the unwashed masses), it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts. (Those who were there will, I hope, remember that I tried very hard.) 

I need not recount the history of how this nascent policy eventually withered and died. Ultimately, it became very clear that the most active and influential members of the projectbeginning with Jimmy Wales, who hired me to start a free encyclopedia project and who now manages Wikipedia and Wikimediawere decidedly anti-elitist in the above-described sense. 

Consequently, nearly everyone with much expertise but little patience will avoid editing Wikipedia, because they willat least if they are editing articles on articles that are subject to any sort of controversybe forced to defend their edits on article discussion pages against attacks by nonexperts. This is not perhaps so bad in itself. But if the expert should have the gall to complain to the community about the problem, he or she will be shouted down (at worst) or politely asked to """"work with"""" persons who have proven themselves to be unreasonable (at best). 

This lack of respect for expertise explains the first problem, because if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, they would have long since invited a board of academics and researchers to manage a culled version of Wikipedia (one that, I think, would not directly affect the way the main project is run). But because project participants have such a horror of the traditional deference to expertise, this sort of proposal has never been taken very seriously by most Wikipedians leading the project now. And so much the worse for Wikipedia and its reputation. 

This lack of respect for expertise and authority also explains the second problem, because again if the project participants had greater respect for expertise, there would necessarily be very little patience for those who deliberately disrupt the project. This is perhaps not obvious, so let me explain. To attact and retain the participation of experts, there would have to be little patience for those who do not understand or agree with Wikipedia's mission, or even for those pretentious mediocrities who are not able to work with others constructively and recognize when there are holes in their knowledge (collectively, probably the most disruptive group of all). A less tolerant attitude toward disruption would make the project more polite, welcoming, and indeed open to the vast majority of intelligent, well-meaning people on the Internet. As it is, there are far fewer genuine experts involved in the project (though there are some, of course) than there could and should be. 

It will probably be objected by some that, since I am not 100% committed to the most radical sort of openness, I do not understand why the project that I founded works: it works, I will be told, precisely because it is radically openeven anarchical. 

I know, of course, that Wikipedia works because it is radically open. I recognized that as soon as anyone; indeed, it was part of the original plan. But I firmly disagree with the notion that that Wikipedia-fert",0,0,0,0,0,0
483ea60e739f5539,"""::::You're assuming far more about my views than I've actually said. I have two related points. First, that the topic in question is not necessarily bound to an adherence to the concept of self-reported identity, and that to do so is unencyclopaedic. Second, that it is absurd to assert the logical invalidity of all other definitions of the word """"man"""" but that based on self-reported identity.

I agree that the example is conceptually difficult. My view is that a range of interally consistent interpretations of that situation are possible, such that the choice betweeen these arguments cannot be made on a strictly logical basis. The arguments must admit of some strictly non-deductive premises (adductive, inductive etc.) It should be clear then that I'm certainly not advocating a """"definitive, binary and absolute"""" definition of """"man"""". And my reference to Wittgenstein is based upon his fundamental recognition that any word is a """"social construct""""; indeed it is precisely because of this that Wittgenstein argues that nothing that is exclusively self-defined (such as his example of the 'beetle' in the box) can have meaning.

 To conclude, whilst there legitimate arguments for doing so, we don't have to """"wade into the mud"""" of self-identity, and basic encylopaedic principles demand that.

 Corm Capital SPEEDY Deletion 

Dear Darkwind (!),

This page is not unambiguously promotional and definitely does not deserve deletion! The page was NOT created by Corm Capital! That said, reading it and now that it has been created, its purpose is not about promoting Corm Capital but giving a different perspective on the company. Corm Capital is a company with over 1 billion USD in private funds and extremely well established in the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA). Furthermore, S&P;/Bloomberg conducted in-depth research on the company, its subsidiaries and senior management before including it in its ultra-selective S&P; Capital IQ database (public link available at http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapid=238637949). And the list goes on and on...

Bottom line: Corm Capital is a company founded in 1998 with private funds over 1 billion USD and extremely well established in MENA. Having not created this page but having stumbled upon this deletion message, I strongly contest the deletion of this article on the grounds that Corm Capital DESERVES to have a Wikipedia page on it like so many other smaller, less interesting and less established companies that have one. If the content is the problem (I noticed that the description was a taken from our website), PLEASE allow my team some time to arrange it according to Wikipedia's guiding principles.

Also, please note that my grandfather's Wikipedia page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Corm) has been online for years and has been visited by thousands if not millions of people (my grandfather is in most offline encyclopedias). I personally guard his page when """"incorrect"""" material is inserted in his Wikipedia page so I am well aware of Wikipedia's SPIRIT and GOVERNING PRINCIPLES.

Please trust my sincerity with regards to this deletion matter and please feel free to suggest steps you recommend I/Corm Capital take in order to avoid such an undeserved action (your warning page is impossible to understand!).

I have been a staunch supporter and promoter of Wikipedia for the last 10 years.

Once again, I urge you to remove your deletion of the Corm Capital page to give time to my team to write a """"Wikepdia friendly"""" page.

 Texas Tech seal images 

I note that you reverted my replacement of Image:TTU Seal.svg, Image:TTUS Seal.svg and Image:TTUHSC Seal.svg with Image:Texas Tech CoA.png in their respective articles.  The reason I replaced them was twofold:

First of all, it simply seems to me that, at least for the TTU and TTUHSC articles (not so sure about TTUS) the Coat of Arms would more accurately reflect the overall visual identity of the institutions in question; according to the visual identity guidelines at , """"[t]he Official Seal and Signature are [...] reserved for use by the Office of the President of Texas Tech University and are used to represent the official business of the university"""", whereas the academic Coat of Arms is intended as a """"unified identity for all academic entities within the Texas Tech University System"""".  Using the Coat of Arms instead of the seals in our articles would also seem to reduce the (admittedly small) chance of them being mistaken for official documents of the university, and complies with the advice (which, while we are not bound by it under fair use, it would seem courteous for use to follow) that """"[t]he Official Seal and Official Signature may be used only for documents and publications that represent official business of Texas Tech University"""" and that """"[d]ocuments that are not official and formal should use the appropriate Academic Signature"""" (i.e. the Coat of Arms).  It also allows us to use a single image for all the articles, not to mention, in my opinion at least, showing the interesting part of the logo more clearly without the distracting border and text around it.

The second, and more significant, reason for the replacement, however, was that, while I'd originally uploaded those SVG seal images in good faith, believing them to be acceptable with U.S. fair use law as well as our policies, upon further reflection I'm not longer as convinced of this as I was.  In particular, while there are reasons for arguing that the SVG versions are not too detailed to pass criterion 3(b), especially given that they're freely available from the TTU web site anyway, I now feel that, regardless of the acceptability of their absolute level of detail, they are nonetheless replaceable by less detailed bitmap images, and therefore fail the non-free content criterion 3(a).

Thus, I no longer believe those images are appropriate for Wikipedia, and do not want myself to be associated with them.  As their uploader, I have the right to delete them; the reason I chose to tag them as orphan instead of deleting them directly is that I wanted to keep them around for a while, in case someone did object to the change, and did not want others to end up tagging them (and warning me about it) while they were there.  That said, I still don't want them to stay around forever with my name in the upload log; if you want to, despite the issues I outlined above, you're free to reupload them (or bitmap versions of them) under a different title, thereby assuming the responsibility of asserting their compliance under our policies and U.S. law.  I no longer want that responsibility.

Oh, and regarding the use of the TTUHSC seal at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso Campus, I'm pretty sure that blatantly violates our non-free content criterion 8.  It's not like that article really needs (either of) the images, anyway.  —  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

___________________________

JanetteDoe, You are right that the referenced article in National Review is about not changing the fundamental principles of democracy, not a """"constitution"""". And this is why I have a BIG problem with Lone boatman and the three other """"editors"""" who suddenly showed up for the first timee and agreed with Lone boatman. Lone boatman does not want the word """"democracy"""". After I accused him of synthesizing he then took revenge by changing the entire article into a catch all international page in which he redefines 'eternity clause' as a """"term"""" used internationally instead of the colloquial description specific to Article 79 paragraph (3) of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. This page was part of the German law page specific to Germany, not an international one which is already covered under a Wikipedia article entitled """"entrenched clause"""". Lone boatman added the additional international data at the top of the page only to cover up the 'eternity clause' article. And again he focused on the word """"constitution"""" at the top of his change. And when I told him he had wrongfully duplicated the """"entrenched clause"""" to pursue his use of the word """"constitution"""" (which I had previously told him Germany does not have), he then added """"Basic Law"""" to his change to make it appear that he is not politically motivated with his changes. Then several editors suddently showed up for the first time and one of them deleted the entire 'eternity clause' article, leaving only what Lone boatman had put in at the top. Wikipedia is apparently no place to safeguard an article, even a properly referenced article, which the article was. And it was not a personal essay on a statute, as I have been accused of. It is an important historic prohibition placed in the Germany's Basic Law regarding the protection of Germany's new democracy.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thank you for your message and kind words; they're very much appreciated!   
Thank you also for the correction you're suggesting. I will look into the sources I used for the Planxty reunion dates and locations, and then update this section later on. Normally, I would do this straight away but I am quite busy at the moment and will be for the next few days. However, please know that I will definitely aim to fix this if I can, as I am always striving to ensure there is a third-party source for everything I contribute to the encyclopaedia. Of course, if some of these 3rd-party sources are wrong, then it's going to be tricky!
I also notice that you are a brand new user, who has made your first edit today, and to my user page! So, a very warm welcome to you and I hope you will enjoy your time here, either as a reader or maybe also as a contributing editor. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if your user and/or talk pages get supdated very soon with a 'Welcome' message from editors who like to take 'newbies' (= newcomers) under their wings.  
But if you look at my user page, you will see that I collected a lot of links to Wikipedia articles that provide details about editorial guidelines, such as the 'Manual Of Style' (Wiki:MOS). May I also suggest that, if you want some help in getting started as an editor, you can ask me and I will edit a few pointers in your own user- and talk-pages. You don't *have* to do any of these things, but if you're interested and have the time, then I'l be happy to help you in your first steps. So, just let me know, OK?
Finally, although I made quite a few changes to the 'Planxty' article (and especially to the 'Andy Irvine (musician)' article), one of the essential principles of our encyclopaedia is that these articles do not 'belong' to any one editor: we all contribute what we can without any article ever becoming 'mine'. In my case, I just happen to have been a Planxty (and Irvine) fan  for a long time and had kept a lot of reference material (mainly my collection of folk music magazines) that proved very useful to update the articles. I am still working on the Irvine article and the next tasks will be to create related articles for some of the albums.

 Lets start with the opening three paragraphs 

I think we put this version on the discussion page, FunkyFly had few concerns, we addressed them, and we should start with this version:

Macedonism (Bulgarian: Македонизъм, Macedonian and Serbian: Македонизам) is a term mostly used in Bulgaria, and to some extent Greece (Kofos) to describe the perceived negative aspects of Macedonian Nationalal Movement. In Bulgaria this term is used primarily by the nationalists to describe the Macedonian National Movement as a political ideology, or a regional linguistic separatist movement. In Greece this term is used almost exclusively by Kofos in the context of United Macedonia related subjects. In an extreme context, the word itself means that there is no authentic, but only an artificial Macedonian nationhood, an ideological mindset imposed by Yugoslav socialism (Macedonians = Bulgarian Macedonists) .

The term is chiefly a Balkan regionalism, rarely used in the English historiography. It is not found neither in Enciclopedia Britanica nor in the Oxford English Dictionary.

In the article The Macedonian Question published on 18th January 1871 in the """"Macedonia"""" newspaper in Constaninople by Petko Rachev Slaveikov, Makedonism was defined and critized, his adherants were named Macedonists, and this may be one of the earliest surviving references to it.

Please don't alter it without a previous discussion.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Iranian Villagers
Halstead et al. reported that some Iranian villagers with very little animal product intake (dairy once a week, meat once a month) had normal B12 levels. None had megaloblastic anemia. Their average B12 level was 411 pg/ml which was quite high considering their diet. The authors speculated this could be because their diets, which were very low in protein, allowed for B12-producing bacteria to ascend into the ileum where the B12 could be absorbed. They also speculated that because they lived among their farm animals and their living areas were littered with feces, they picked up enough B12 through contamination.

Halstead et al.'s 1960 report was in contrast to Wokes et al.'s 1955 report  in which numerous British vegans were found to have neurological symptoms of B12 deficiency.

Conclusion
B12 production by bacteria in the small intestine is possible. Some vegans can ward of overt vitamin B12 deficiency, and even mild B12 deficiency by remaining cautious. Now people like mihaiam may choose to doubt all these scientific findings hinging on their favourite anti-vegan blogs.

I agree fully.  There's nothing inherently pejorative about the term.  """"Redskin"""" and """"Pale Face"""" even enjoy a certain amount use as terms of affection between the two races.  I imagine that there are some Native Americans who dislike the term (just as some, maybe even more understandably, hate the word """"Indian""""), just as there are some who find the terms white, black, and yellow offensive.  (Though """"yellow"""" is probably a special case, since it is sometimes associated with cowardice, there are still some contexts in which few if any people would be offended by it, such as in """"all people, whether White, Black, Red, or Yellow, should be treated equally"""", in which the usage is very explicitly non-derogatory.)

Although, this may depend on the area or the individuals involved.  For example, a Native American would probably not be offended by being called a  """"Redskin"""" by a White friend who he knows to be anything but a racist, but might strongly object to being called a """"Redskin"""" by a member of the KKK.  Likewise, in areas where Native Americans are the largest racial """"minority"""", there has probably already been a long history of mutual cooperation and friendship between the Whites and """"Redskins"""" of the area (and many Whites who very proudly boast a Native herritage), who would not immediately think any word was intended pejoratively unless given good reason to do so.  I know in my area, where racism against Mexicans and Asians is somewhat common (and sadly, even expected), the idea of racism against Natives is strange and alien, since the Whites and the Redskins here have such a long history together and such a strong respect for one another.  Although that might also have to do with the fact that most of the cities in my area were founded by Scottish and Irish immigrants who were treated as outcasts in the rest of the U.S., so the Whites who settled here in the early years knew first-hand how hurtful prejudices and stereotypes could be.

In any event, it's not really accurate (and more than a little ignorant) to say that the word """"Redskin"""" is a pejorative, when it is clearly not an offensive word in all contexts, and may even be, as mentioned above, a term of as a term of affection.  00:01, August 16, 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Pope Francis article: quote from Jerusalem Post editorial 

Hi, Herzen!  Wanted to make sure you saw that I reverted an edit you made on the Pope Francis article, asking that the issue be discussed on the talk page. I did change the sentence you had deleted to reflect the fact that it came from an editorial (not an """"article"""") in the Jerusalem Post. Sorry for my mistake!!! (Guess it was my sloppy thinking, just categorizing """"editorials"""" and """"news articles"""" as different types of """"articles"""".)  However, I think it's a really wonderful quote, only positive. The Jerusalem Post is a highly respected paper representing the views of an important segment of the Jewish community: those who live in Israel.  If we talk about relations between this pope and the Jewish community, I think it's great to have a quote from a paper like that, basically saying that this pope has been in a place that gave him a chance to have a rich relationship with the Jewish community  perhaps richer than any previous pope. Anyway, I think it's a very good quote in a section that addresses the pope's prior relationship with the Jewish community. I hope you'll reconsider your objection.  In the meantime, I have asked for the opinion of other editors.  Hope we can all agree! Best wishes, and thanks for all your good work on this article.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

It is not your job to police Wikipedia. You technically have no job here. But if you want to better the readers' experience, maybe better the article so that it follows the website's guidelines?

I don't know. I never really thought laziness was an admirable trait of a moderator. Please reconsider.

Teh Point.

Zarove, I don't have yahoo, and I see no reason why you feel the need to discuss this with me privately. Everything you've brought up below can be discussed on the talk page. As I've said, I may drop by the Christian Forum once this is resolved. 

SHorter vewrsion.

1: After this si resolved whats the point? No one theireven knows of this fiasco.

2: You used my administration their ito show Im biased. I am a Zealoted Christain. This was a shameful tactic. Its absicllay """"Guilt by association."""" It sbad enough Im labled one of Holdigns followers.Yopu even tried ot prove I was a fidny by linkign me with creationism.

At the same tiem you decree any attmeot to examine Dorothy as """" Smearing her."""" I didnt msmear her to dicredit her. But you smear me to discredit me.

Nothign in my own past reveals any bias, and Im toelrnt of all views, but nto all condict.

3: As you refuse to bother to listen to reason, I want ot see if I can one on one discuss the matte with you.

Sorry, not interested. I don't see what the point would be.  

No rellay working.

The difficulty onthe talk page is yor blatant willignness to decieve others abotu me usign the same tactic you claim I use againt Acharya. You claim that I am a covert Zelous Christain wantign to defame her, and you merley wish to defend the truth. We both know this isnt true James. You want peopel to beelive her ideas and are willignto do anyhtign to make her seem as imprsive as possibl an rmeove all oposiiton to her vies.

My Chrisytaintiy is sued asa blundgeoon. You make it osund as if I oppose Acharya base don my faiht, hate her, and vehemntly opose her, and htus want ot attakc her. You then claim the aritlce is written in sch a way that it attakcs her. No spacific exampels of attakc are shown gowever.

I can assure you, nothign ithe article that is the current ocncensus among the general posters ( As oppsoed ot the Acharyans) is derogatory towards her.

But yo wish to rmeove the links ot CHrisyain rebuttals and all critisms.

If Dorothy wants to attack Chrisgaunity, why has she then no supply of courage to stand up to their rebuttals?

Midn you, Im not th eon makign suh a rebuttal. THis is WIkipedia, and I am ever midnful fo the need tobe Unbiased. Thoughyou will nto accept hat form me.

On the one hand not only the basic mechanisms of evolution (variation by mutation, natural selection...), but also the whole mechanism of evolution can be observed. Not nearly as easily as gravity, but it can be observed. (Maybe here the example of antibiotic resistance would be a better, more verifiable example than the fruit flies) Still the mechanism of evolution is only a theory explaining observations which were intuitively called 'evolution'. Those observations are facts (here you got evolution as a fact). The explanation by the mechanisms of evolution is not. It is a theory by definition. On the other hand the theory of historical evolution explaining the variety of species can't be observed, because it is supposed to have happened in the past. You can only observe Fossils and the current flora and fauna. Then you can try to explain how all this came into being; for example by assuming a random abiogenesis of a single cell and then applying the mechanism of evolution. This random abiogenesis and the following evolution over millions of years is what a layman thinks of as 'evolution'. This certainly is 'only' a theory. It isn't and never will be a fact. It is very importent to clearly differentiate these things. Strictly speaking even the assumption that everything always falls downwards cannot be considered a fact. How can you know that there will never be a stone being observed falling upwards?? This may seem a bit like I'm splitting hairs, but if you don't strictly apply well defined terms of 'fact' and 'theory' you will end where we where a few centuries ago considering it a fact that we live on a flat earth.

The article is pretty dry given the colourful period; and there's no such thing as a stable majority in this period, no matter what it looks like on election day; there were no parties, perosonal alalliances shifted with the bar tab; There's a whole passage that's basically about the Carnarvon Terms but I've kind of gone into that previously aabove, also the public works i nteh '70s being the Lillooet Cattle Trail fiasco; this article like that of othe early Premires in B C needs a lot more juice, a lot more dirt; the source here is the Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online, which is pretty dry to start with and condenses BC history in strange (to me) ways, among them this terseness and the oblique references to what were actually specific and major items in the provincial polity/political culture.  I don't have BC history books handy, but there's some good stuff on Walkem around...Mark S. Wade's The Cariboo Road'' had some doo-doo on Cariboo politics re Walkem's elections there for instance....I hope maybe one day some other wikipedian slogs through all this and takes on the task of enriching the early Premiers articles; there's so much more intereesting than just the straight bio here.....and on others.....ditto with the Governors of course...and not a few L-G's.

 Ramdasia section: Reverts by you 

I would like to know why you have reverted the Ramdasia page?
I have constantly provided valid links and proofs but the user Ravinder121 is deleting them without providing any information why and is not engaging in any kind of discussion regarding this.

My argument is that Ramdasia is a subcaste of Chamars but because Chamar are a traditionally a """"lower caste"""" this seems to have offended Ravinder121. Any proof or links that I provide backing up my claim are very quickly deleted by him, while he himself provides none or links that just offer vague associations.

Here are my links that prove my points:
Castes and Tribes of Punjab by G.W Briggs written in 18th century lists Ramdasia as Chamars. How do you explain that?

2) Cyber stalking, hate speech, and many other issues which Wikipedia Review has hit on, and it has been viewed by some pro-Wikipedia loyalists that Wikipedia Review is an example of these, and that it should be discussed in a context that does not include discussion of Wikipedia, or of its criticisms of Wikipedia.

reveals divinity to be real, including that of Jesus and heaven, etc.

equate to only a human being who is a larger teacher of mankind; but when

b4f8df6882520554,"Osteosarcoma Risk 
I have edited the statement regarding the association between neutering and osteosarcoma (OSA) because it was far stronger than the citation, or the literature in general, supports. In a single study of a single breed with a known risk for osteosarcoma far higher than most other breeds, the data showed the total lifetime exposure to sex hormones was negatively correlated with the incidence of OSA. The incidence of the disease was not statistically different between neutered and intact animals overall, though it was different between animals neutered at less than 1 year of age and intact animals. And there is no reason to suggest these findings would support a general relationship between neutering and OSA incidence in other breeds or mixed-breed dogs. Given the questionable clinical significance of the finding (intact animals actually died slightly, though not significantly, earlier than neutered animals overall) and the much more thoroughly demonstrated protective benefits of neutering on life expectancy and other kinds of cancer, I do not find this study sufficient to support a general assertion that OSA risk is a meaningful disadvantage of neutering.

Railway stations of Budapest
Hi,

I've just seen that a few days ago you moved Eastern Railway Station (Budapest) to Budapest keleti pályaudvar (and did the same with the other two railway stations of the city). I don't think this was a good idea, for several reasons:
 English Wikipedia has a policy of using the English names whenever it's possible (Wikipedia:Naming conventions (use English). An average reader, when looking at the article title, won't know what's this article about, unless they open it and read it. The word pályaudvar will be totally unintelligible for the majority of them.
 You wrote (in the edi summary of the Keleti station) that this was to keep in line with a convention of using original names, but glancing at a few randomly chosen railway station article from non-English-speaking countries it seems that this is not a convention, some of them use English names, some of them don't. (Also, you don't seem consistent since you didn't move the articles of the other Hungarian stations.)
 """"Budapest keleti pályaudvar"""" is incorrect in Hungarian. The city name itself is never a part of the name of railway stations, unless it's the only station of the city. (It's incorrect grammatically too.)

Can we please move back these three articles to their previous names?

Tila Nguyen
Hello,

I see you've deleted Tila Nguyen from Category:Porn stars and List of heterosexual erotic actresses.  I know Tila does mostly softcore work, but if you search around you will see she appears in films caressing other women in the nude and in a very explicitly sexual manner that is intended to arouse the viewer.  I think she at least qualifies as an erotic actress, even if not completely a porn star.   04:22, 20 Sep 2004 (UTC)

 Cuyamaca 

I noticed that you added the merge tag to Cuyamaca and Cuyamaca, California. I originally created a single article but it seemed to me that towns and villages tend to have dedicated articles so I split the article in two. I'm inclined to agree that a single article would be sufficient. Is this consistent with other articles that cover a city, town or village and the like-named region in which they sit? If so, in your opinion, should the articles be consolidated under """"Cuyamaca"""" or """"Cuyamaca, California""""?  17:58, 27 Sep 2004 (UTC)

I couldn't find enough information about the village to expand it so I merged Cuyamaca with Cuyamaca, California and marked Cuyamaca for deletion. I assume that all the other particulars, such as the duplicate article page, will be taken care of.  00:51, 28 Sep 2004 (UTC)

 I am encouraged by your feedback.  Let me clear it up a bit first: my version is written basically with Paul Graham's article on this topic in my mind.  I think that article is neither an undue appraisal nor an unfair dismissal of the term, and I think it would be a good and neutral starting point for me when I re-write the lead.
 According to that article, Web 2.0 can be boiled down into three things: democracy, Ajax, and focus on user.  This is how I structure the lead sentence: democracy (ie architecture of participation in Tim O'Reilly's words, and folksonomy in realisation) and user focus in the first part, and better UI powered with Ajax in the second.
 Specific replies as follows:
 lengthy list: agree, although the current version also features a long list as well.  Perhaps we can break down that clause into two, like this:
 ... that put emphasis on allowing users to share and collaborate information online in new ways as part of the service, presented in a user-friendly, interactive, and often Ajax-enabled, user interface.
 """"collaborate information"""": my wrong.  Let's preserve the order in the current version, ie """"collaborate and share information"""".
 folksonomy: see my point re: democracy and architecture of participation above.  I do believe that this is an important feature that distinguish Web 2.0 from the old: a platform, built-in as part of the service, that allows users to actively contribute to the grouping and ranking of contents.  You won't have that pre-Web 2.0.  Even the readers' ranking at Amazon.com was initially a secondary feature.
 cluttering the lead: please see if the revised version above would make it better presented.  And as I have mentioned above, the original version suffers from the same problem as well.
 focus on what web 2.0 is: I believe this is what I am doing with the revised version.  The current version simply mentions too much of O'Reilly Media, but the term has evolved far beyond their reach and control.  And I do believe the revised version does sufficiently address the fact that it has become a buzzword in the marketing sense.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I think that the reputation of the Marine Corps has more to do with its actual historical performance on the battlefield, rather than considerations such as the selectivity of its recruitment or basic training, something that probably would distinguish it in the """"European"""" perspective that you cite.
Another consideration is the scope, size and responsibility of the Corps.  The Marine Corps is not and has never been organized across its entire organization as a """"special-operations-type"""" organization, such as the SEALs, Special Forces, or, if you will, Royal Marines or SAS.  The article points out that the Corps is larger than the British Army in its entirety.  What the Marine Corps has done for most of its history, and what has distinguished it largely from the US Army, is serve as a mobile and convenient expeditionary force, in coordination with the Navy, in a large number of small actions in support of US policy, most of them in the Western Hemisphere or in Asia.  (THe US didn't even maintain a large standing peacetime Army until after 1945).  Outside those years when a major war was being fought (technically, the US Congress has declared war only five times in history), if someone saw an armed American in their country, that person was likely to be a Marine.
I would argue that the most relevant perspective on the reputation of the Marine Corps would be the perspectives and memories of its historical enemies.  I would invite anyone interested, and will work myself, to find and document in this article reliable quotes and sources of those who have encountered Marines in battle.

Hi Memlikelmendi. My name is Qwyrxian, and I'm an administrator here at Wikipedia. I wanted to try to explain what happened above in simpler terms. The first, most important thing, is that, as a general rule, you should not try to write an article about yourself. This is because we have found that people with a conflict of interest simply are unable to write good, well-sourced, neutral articles about themselves or organizations they are closely involved with. As such, once you are notable enough, someone will eventually make an article on you. If you really want to try to make an article on yourself, you should try to use the Articles for Creation process, since that will allow another editor to review your work and give suggestions.

The other reason why the article was deleted, which is tied in to what I said above, is that the article was overly promotional. It used excessive, praising language for the composer, which violates WP:NPOV. Moreover, it didn't have any references; to have an article, a subject must have been discussed in detail in multiple, independent, reliable sources.

On this point I was wondering whether there's a danger of over emphasising the parties in this election. Although it makes sense for other elections it's clear that independent candidates are going to do unusually well (although I don't know if any will win) because of the specific nature of the posts being elected. I wonder if there is a way to highlight the independent vote (which will likely  outstrip Lib Dem and UKIP's vote nationally. Obviously one problem is that they are all different but I think to write them out of the picture will give an unfairly distorted picture. Not sure what the best way to do that is though... 87.112.83.16  11:52, 16 November 2012 (UTC",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Oct 1961 to Oct 1962 Armament 

The following information was moved to the talk page from main article   

At least During my Duty on the USS Newell (DER322) between Oct1961 and Oct1962 she was armed with enclosed dual 3""""-50 Cal. Guns and two Hedge Hog Antisubmarine Munitions Launchers, among other things. As to when the Gun complement was changed will need to be investigated by others. My memory is Vague as to if we had two or three such dual mounts. All of them were capable of coupling to a Flying Bridge level Gun fire director for coordinated targeting. At the same time we had both a surface search radar and a separate Air Search radar installation. From my memories, we had four 10 cylinder F-M Opposed Crank Diesel main engines, two per shaft, and additional 8 cylinder F-M Opposed Crank Diesels coupled to Generators for ships Electric Power.

2. There are multiple players providing this kind of payment which means there is an industry that is of value being discussed. The article mentions the multiple players in this industry which means it isn't advertising but informative.
3. Bill2Phone is like paypal and paypal is deemed acceptable.  I would only presume it is because of usage or longevity of the product. (see point 4 and 5 to address this)
4. The article focuses on an industry / payment option that has been in place for 23 years, but is not addressed elsewhere in the wiki thereby making it valuable
5. The industry is in the billions of dollars cleared and settled which makes is significant
6. There were many industry references leading to the history
7. There was no blatant discussion as to benefits of this payment type over other payment types or in comparison to the competition. Therefore there was no blatant advertising.

We all agree that the Transnistria page is a difficult one to edit because there are strong views on both sides. The current page is a work of twisted words and opinions and is not acceptable to any fairminded person. . I have a proposal to normalise things here. Forgive me but it is a Moldovan solution.  Take a look at the Moldova main space and you will see an interesting list of headings for the topics in keeping with the way most otherr states are dealt with. Then, take a look at the headings for the Transnistrian page and you'll see a marked difference. I suggest that the editors work under an agreement of equality and respect.

The article for """"Titanic"""" doesn't specify that Jack and Rose felt """"physical attraction"""" for one another.  There is no need to add this phrase as it can be taken as a given in a story about adults that """"fall in love"""", and """"lust"""" is just insulting in this context.

HR vol. 15 no. 3 (May / June 1995), pg. 46: In a letter, Martin writes, """"Personally, I am about brimful (sic?) on 'gas chambers' and may stop reading about the subject.

In a letter entitled """"Reflections on a Death,"""" Martin writes about the Holocaust, """"...the Holocaustians have turned the whole thing into a new religion anyway. To me there is a close relation between a racket like this one and spiritualism, for example. Holocaust zealots trap their revisionist critics in much the same way that the spiritualists treated their scoffers during their heyday...The 'Hoaxers' do much the same thing: the more outrageous of the Holocaust atrocities they endlessly circulate don't have to be proven. Instead, it is up to those who deny they happened to prove they did not...One of these days I should try to get a foundation to underwrite a trip to central Africa. After returning I would announce that I had encountered a tribe of talking monkeys, and then challenge anyone who does not believe me to prove otherwise.""""

Strange. I was almost sure that Karen Ryan is a pen name of William Mauco, as part of the article Igor Smirnov, Pridnestrovie's Khozyain president from """"Tiraspol Times"""" is copied word-by-word from the article Khozyain from Wikipedia, which was writen by William Mauco. Only after that was discovered started Mauco to write """"officially"""" in TIraspol Times with the name William Maurice. Comparison:

Wikipedia's Khozyain, stub written by Mauco 21 July 2006: Khozyain is a Russian term often used to describe a certain type of political leader. It is rich term which traditionally refers to a leader of a given social domain, a home, a village, an enterprise, or a country. The khozyain of a household is usually the oldest male and is entrusted with the welfare of the group. For someone to merit the title of a real khozyain he must take care of those in his domain. Russians tend to judge leaders, including politicians, on whether they are (or give the impression of being) a real khozyain. They are sometimes hard to classify in a classical political sense since their overriding concerns are not a leftist or rightist political agenda, but the welfare of the group where ideology is less important than pragmatism, strength of character and problem solving skills. A person who displays talents in this direction is called a khozyaistvennik. A khozyain politician can easily be seen as authoritarian in a Western political context. A more accurate description would be to classify him as a father figure. Examples of khozyain politicians: Yuri Luzhkov and Igor Smirnov.

article in Tiraspol Times by Karen Ryan, 11 September 2006, part """"The Khozyain president"""": Khozyain is a Russian term often used to describe a certain type of political leader; the prototype of the style of Igor Smirnov, Pridnestrovie's own """"Khozyain"""" head of state.

Igor Smirnov and the other founding fathers of the republic have declared on many occasions, from the earliest day of the independence struggle, that what they wanted to create was a society free of """"isms."""" A khozyain politician can easily be seen as authoritarian in a Western political context, and, true to form, Igor Smirnov has been called both a """"strongman"""" and, by the more radical Smirnov-haters in Moldova, a """"dictator"""". A more accurate description, for those who understand the true meaning of the word khozyain, would be to classify him as a father figure.

History and Giving Context for Atlanta Demographics - adding numbers to population chart
While Fulton County did not encompass all of what is in the Atlanta SMSA today, I think it is misleading to provide only Atlanta City population numbers in the mid-19th c. While it was established as a railroad terminus, it didn't exist by itself.

In 1860 Fulton County had a total of 14,427 people.  There were 2955 enslaved African-Americans, 20.5% of the population.  While much of north GA had mostly yeoman farmers, both Cobb and Fulton County also had planters (defined by historians as holding 20 or more slaves), who held slaves for labor on large cotton plantations. 

(I know more about Roswell in Cobb county, than Fulton, but the origins of major planters and the slaves they brought with them are likely similar. Roswell King and planters he invited to join him in his enterprise (at what became Roswell) were from the coast. King brought 36 slaves from his coastal plantation and bought another 42 at Darien, GA, to take with him to work on building his house, the mill, and supporting buildings. Archibald Smith brought 36 slaves with him from his coastal plantations in St. Marys County and created a 300-acre cotton plantation in Roswell. King's idea was to have cotton production AND  processing in the same place. The forced migration of slaves from the coast to north GA meant they brought their unique Geechee culture and language with them.  Where slaves were held in larger numbers on plantations, it's likely they kept their culture and traditions going.) 

Atlanta and Fulton County in fact more than doubled in population from 1860 to 1870. People rushed to rebuild the city.  In a pattern typical of other areas, many newly freed African-Americans left plantations to move to town to work at trades or crafts, to have safety in numbers and to try to set up lives apart from white control.  

By 1870 Fulton County had grown to 33,446 people.  Among them were 15,282 """"colored"""", as defined by the census, 45.7% of the population. 

NOTEWORTHY CITIZENS: Atlanta boasts two Nobel Prize winners: Rev. Martin Luther King, the youngest man to receive the Nobel Prize, and President Jimmy Carter.  Each were awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace.

I do appreciate your attempted summary of a history of Satanism. how did you arrive at the 13th century (1200s) as the time of the origin of Roman Catholicism propaganda using the term? the OED? is your selection of the late 1800s (that leaves at least 600 years of history unmapped!) based on Dashwood or the Taxil Hoax material? absent defining """"Satanism"""" beyond propaganda, i don't see how priests """"caught experimenting with magic or accused of being witches or committing various heresies"""" necessarily represents a 'backfire'. are you maintaining that magical practice and/or the practice of witchcraft/heresies were indicators of the propagandistic 'satanism' of the Roman Catholic Church? if so, and these may be identified, can we run down a list of these identifiers for the 'first part' of Satanism's history (as a tool of religious propaganda)? I don't follow your reference to Richard Ramirez here, or why he is some kind of example of a """"backfire"""" of religious propaganda. is it because he uses the propaganda as a fear-inspirer with the communication of the media?

as regards 'Reverse Christians' or 'Inverse Christians', i don't think that these kinds of beliefs began being called 'Satanism' in any systemic sense until the 20th century as self-applied. if you know differently, please point out some instances, as i would be very interested to learn of the linguistic history.

with regard to this article, it extends off of the Satanism_(disambiguation) page, to whose Talk page you have posted many times, and thus without that disambiguation, it could well become anything associated with the term. if this is your contention, then you ought to be stating this on the previously-mentioned Talk page also so that we can get the disambiguation removed, else more clearly indicating what you want to do, since presently that page says """"Satanism is a catch-all term referring to several religious movements."""" (my bolding) please make up your mind or at least forge an agreement with me about it. ) consider this some kind of 'Satanic' olive branch.

for my part, i suggest that the disambiguation page list the various categories of referent for the term (add to these if you have ideas):
(1) propaganda;
(2) proto-religion in inversion interior to Christianity and de facto statuses;

 Organization of this Discussion Page  

I would like to collapse several threads that are dealing with the same issue into one section each respectively, with subsections as appropriate.  Main categories that could be stagnate: """"The Photo"""", """"The Lede"""", """"Hunt"""", """"Kissing of Feet"""", """"Time Article"""", """"References"""", and all the discussion over the article about Jossi, his statement of purpose, and everyone's comments who were """"disturbed"""".
I think this would help the snowballing of this page, as well as keep some editors in here from starting new threads about a subject that has been well covered.
Also, I think this would help any outside admins or editors to see in a concise manner the way in which the page is discussed.   

Balance Teachings and Criticism Sections
As the teachings section has a link to a teachings page which is 100% pro prem could someone restore Criticism of Prem Rawat and add a link from the criticism section? 82.150.96.2    

 Criticisms 

Since Prem Rawat is controversial a criticism section feels relevant. This criticism section has been deleted or removed several times without comments by Momento and/or others. A previous article called """"Criticism of Prem Rawat """" has also been deleted. It has also been noted that an external link to a site about Prem Rawat and his work has been removed by Jossi without comment. However edit warring is prohibited Wikipedia:Edit war.

Any disputes should be dealt with using the dispute resolution process. 76.102.196.148   178.26.39.46

User IP 76.102.196.148, you are an anonymous, unregistered user. This article is the only one you have ever edited. You have shown a dishonest approach by describing the website you tried to link to as a “website about Prem Rawat and his work.” I suspect you know very well that site is an unmoderated attack site set up with no purpose other than denigrating the subject of this article, who is a living person and protected by the Wikipedia guidelines and rules for  Biographies of living persons. You are doing yourself no favours and are heading for a charge of  disruptive editing. Please avoid this by reading the extensive archives of this discussion page before contributing again.   

User IP 76.102.196.148, you are an anonymous, unregistered user, just like me. This article is one of many that I have edited, but since my ISP changes my IP address from time to time, it just seems I am only editing articles relating to Mr Ji's operations at the moment. I am sometimes incredibly dishonest, but my contributions to wikipedia have to be assessed not on the basis of my appalling crimes, rather, whether they make sense and are informative. I know very well the ex-premie sites are antagonistic towards Mr Ji and that nothing must ever be published that calls into question his good name and the multiple money-collecting organisations run in his name. This is an important piece of international law, with which every article in wikipedia must comply with as at present, under pain of persecution from the latter-day Praetorian Guard. Your contributions will be mercilessly deleted by a handful of premies whose spiritual path has led them to be the guardians of the premie-controlled pages in wikipedia. All I can say is to repeat something once said by a little known British leader some while ago, a man called Winston Churchill. He said: """"Never give in, never give in, never, never, never, never - in nothing, great or small, large or petty - never give in except to convictions of honor and good sense. Never, Never, Never, Never give up. 84.9.48.220  

 Rumiton, your comment in it's current form can easily be seen as a personal attack. You should not make personal attacks anywhere in Wikipedia. Comment on content, not on the contributor.

I've kind of gone back and forth on it over the years, but I've been finding lately that when I've been updating licensees as a result of an acquisition, I've been linking the licensees to the owner's page more often (or at least when I remember to do so). In fact, while I was FCC-less today, I was starting to look at categorization of the larger owners, which is kind of related. The only reason I did the iHeartMedia linking today was because I checked my Watchlist last night for the first time in a while, and saw that there'd been a bunch of changes made in error to the licensees a week or so ago. I figured that while I was cleaning them up anyway, adding the link made sense, and then it was suggested to me that the redirects made more sense than the piping.

Yes, I'd say each of the state pages should absolutely be uniform, just the same as how the alphabetical lists are uniform and the frequency pages are at least uniform-ish. I'd lean toward linking all of the columns other than the frequency, although I wouldn't suggest redlinking licensees where the owner doesn't have a page. That said, that's just my opinion - it's a question that should probably be put to the project, to see what those who are still active in the project think.

  No, that is not seen.  Steve (Quinn), what you and JW called the """"consensus lede"""" was soooooo heavily biased toward the POV of physics (the """"operational definition"""") and measurement that, whether it had existed for 4 years or not, it was far beneath Wikipedia standards.  As I pointed out in the AN/I that you started, you're not a very good listener.  The previous lede was shit.  Only POV.  Your objections have been swatted aside.  The current lede isn't what I would like to see either.  Every word I used has been solidly supported by the OED or MW or AH.  Even """"indefinite"""" (as you shown with your OED link).  Even """"continued"""", even """"progress"""", even """"existence"""".  Your reference to the OED has all those words, yet they don't appear in the lede and you consistently objected to their inclusion.  
You cannot self-righteously hold yourself up as supporting Wikipedia standards.  E.g. and e.g.  Steve Quinn, you're a crappy Wikipedia editor.  You're a POV pusher.  You don't listen.  You don't recognize sourcing when presented to you and you don't recognize the obvious bias and POV in old edits you defend and seem to like.

Yes, but the backlog gets horrible in part because half of the pages there are mistagged. It's a vicious circle we have there. And I understand your view of the criteria but I don't think it's correct because, and that is what I said to Keegan on your RFA as well, admins do not decide whether something is worthy of inclusion. A7 for example is just about whether it may possibly be worthy of inclusion, not if they are worthy. When you gain adminship, you have to remember that your personal views of what is worthy of inclusion and what not are completely irrelevant to your work handling pages where there is doubt (there is an ArbCom case at the moment because one admin decided to delete pages he deemed unencyclopedic outside policy). So carefulness is to be advised in such situations and I am glad you are willing to be more careful. After all, just cutting away spammy text and making a stub out of a potential G11 for example does not take up more time than tagging it. Have a nice day -) Why

Fowler&fowler; has thoughtfully invited me on my Talk page to comment. 
Nichalp says in the present thread """"The term """"British India"""" is generally used in popular parlance to separate independent India from British-governed India"""". I am sure there is some truth in that, but I think the reply is that Wikipedia shouldn't about """"popular parlance"""", it is an encyclopedia and needs to be about scholarship, about detailed and correct information, sourced as well as possible. To put that more grandly, it is about educating the world. To illustrate this point, in the """"popular parlance"""" of much of the world, """"Great Britain"""" and """"England"""" are much the same thing, but by education people learn the difference between them. To have an article on British India here, even one with much improvement needed to it, is a powerful tool in that process of education.
On Nichalp's suggestion that """"British India"""" should be redirected to British Raj"""", I and others do not agree with that, for all of the detailed reasons advanced so far: please see the discussion here and also at Talk:British Raj. And I believe Philip Baird Shearer has said correctly somewhere above that there is a consensus against such a redirect. 
Fowler&fowler; asks """"Would you be opposed to """"British India"""" being redirected to this overview article, British rule in India instead of """"British Raj?"""" """" I, of course, am one of those who believe Wikipedia needs a discrete article, so I should be opposed. 
In general, I do agree with the """"overview article"""" idea which has developed, and if I am invited to help in particular ways then I shall be glad to do what I can, but I do not believe 'British India' would be a possible title for that overview article, as the term has a correct meaning which is significantly less than the whole of India.  
One thought which I believe Fowler&fowler; had some time ago which does strike me as another possible compromise would be to merge Provinces of British India into British India. For reasons of space, the separation might one day be an advantage, but as matters stand at the moment this might be a rationalisation which could make sense to all of us?

The Safavid empire originated in the city of Ardabil in Iranian Azerbaijan and had its origins in the Shiite Safaviyyeh Order. Safavids combined the elements of Turkic tribal militancy with Persian cultural identity and the Shiite teachings of Islam to assert the contemporary Azerbaijani and Iranian Shiite identity. During their reign, Safavids established a vast Iranian empire including the whole of modern Iran and the parts of modern Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, South Caucasus and Turkey.

Cu, I do not think it's so much a matter of translation as of using different recensions. All other things being equal we should use newer versions (though many contain commentaries so can be construed as secondary). But Bede seems to have been messed with over the years. Particularly, you'll find there appears to be a lacuna in all versions - Bede promises to return to """"the siege of Badon-hill, when they made no small slaughter of those enemies, about forty-four years after their arrival in England. But of this hereafter."""" And """"hereafter"""" never comes: what comes is the only loss of temporal sequence in the book. So this is why comprehensive secondary sources are needed. Anyhow, I am not going to try to impose some novel reading but on the other hand I accept that Martin of Tours was a soldier, Germanus led an army, Patrick's mission was accompanied by a Saxon fleet (Annals of Ulster) - I do not want to suppress this information in the service of an unrealistically sweetened picture of these Christian saints either. So this is why I am wary of the idea that those British bishops were dedicated to """"Romanism"""" - in fact the British invented all this """"Joseph of Arimathea"""" stuff purely in order to claim an apostolic succession that did NOT involve Rome.

    As you know, there was an edit war on the mauryan empire and ashoka articles on account of PHG's insistence on positing that ashoka was descended from greeks, in spite of what is stated in the ashokavadana, and establishing it as the mainstream view.

Question
Hey, ! I saw that you were an administrator here, so I was just wondering if you might be able to answer a question I had. The thing is, I'm an admin on a different wiki, and another admin on the same wiki posted a question to the rest of the admins asking if there was a URL that can be used to show any user their current number of edits on the wiki. On our wiki, there's a page called Special:Editcount that conveys that information (I don't think Wikipedia has a page like this though), so another admin advised him to use this URL: http://_________.com/Special:Editcount/Username. That URL would achieve the desired result, but one would have to constantly put the username of the specific user at the end of the URL when posting it on that user's talk page, so my goal was to come up with a way to avoid that; almost to create something you could post on any user's talk page without changing any part of it and still get the desired result. I came up with this: {{fullurl:Special:Editcount/{{BASEPAGENAME}}}}, this way, one could just post the coding on the talk page of the desired user and the returned URL would automatically direct the user to their respective edit count. This worked successfully for every other user whose talk page I tested the coding on (without saving the page, of course); the only problem is that the user he wanted to do this for has an """"*"""" both at the beginning and the end of their username (the second asterisk isn't a problem, just the first), meaning that instead of being returned as:

it gets returned as:

{{fullurl:Special:Editcount/

User*}}

and doesn't take anyone anywhere, because it's just the raw coding. So I was just wondering if you knew of any way to circumvent this problem (aside from just telling him to post """"http://_________.com/Special:Editcount/*User*"""" on the user's talk page, which isn't the end of the world, but is, of course, what I was trying to get around in the first place), maybe by putting some other form of coding that I'm not aware of somewhere in the existing coding or something. Any light you may be able to shed on this problem would be greatly appreciated.

 Kaballah and Tarot 

The article implies that Kaballah and Tarot weren't related until the 19th cent. occult movement. I assume that's a reference to the Golden Dawn. Or Papus. But that's more of an assumption than anything. The cards first appeared, albeit in a somewhat different format, at the same time and in the same place as a flowering of non-Jewish interest in Kaballah. 

I raise this here because 1) I'm not sure how to correct the article, 2) I'm a newbie and would rather not do harm in an attempt to do good, and 3) I'd like to see if anyone else has strong opinions.  

 
Tarot and Qaballah have a 1 to 1 correspondence, and are almost
certainly paralell descriptions of the same mythic archetypes.
The history presented here is propagandist christian; it assumes
that Tarot was started in Italy, which is patently culturacidal
because the cards are part of pagan European mysticism, and they
did all they could to kill off the pagans.
Italies versions were propagandist toy versions of the original,
copied without an understanding of the meanings and changed to suit
the assumptive interests of the new Italian art culture.

 """"1 to 1 correspondence"""" is one interpretation, but a poor one. Parallels between the Tarot and the Tree of Life have been drawn (Eliphas Levy?), but they do not parallel other components of the Qaballah, such as the texts on Gematria. While many neo-pagans have adopted and adapted the Tarot, I seriously doubt any kind of pagan origins (although I'd love to see evidence for such).  

 Could you offer any evidence for your statement of a Pagan predevelopment? The """"normal"""" knowledge about Tarot cards development in Italy lists various examples of really existing old playing cards called Trionfi and really existent documents which use this word Trionfi.  

 
yes, there is proof that the trionfi cards actually did exist.
No, there isn't proof that this is a verifiable point of origin.
Proof can be very hard to come by in a situation involving cultural
genocide, however, there are a variety of esoteric proofs and even easier to understand basic arguments.

The first of these is the simple question of sociology and anthropology. Okay, if Tarot is a product of Italian culture of that Time period, where out of that culture did those symbols derivate?
The answer is, they didn't and couldn't of, they were obviously
symbols from a system the Italians had no knowledge of.

 So YOU say, buddy. Can you please give us some proof that the Italians DIDN'T have any knowledge of tarot symbolism? And what symbolism! Empresses, chariots, the sun... the moon. A tower. All of it stuff with which Italians would have been completely and totally unfamiliar, huh?  Vince In Milan

Other """"proofs"""" as such hinge on increasingly more esoteric facts,
and, as weak an argument as the above sounds, if you know Tarot, it is a VERY sound argument as one starts to apply the basic principle
per card. The Tarot is OBVIOUSLY a wheel of the year mythic architecture, the Elementalist perspective would have been an anacronism in Italian culture of that time period.

new age noise, but another case of somebody who actually saw
the obvious;
http://www.psychicsahar.com/artman/publish/article_399.shtml

As a side note, Tarot suffered more than its sister system, the Tree
of life, which has also been revisionist histroied to start in the 13th century. Unlike Tarot, the proof of this is patently obvious to any who have studied esoteric judaism. The bibles symbols and images
are based on Qaballah, not the other way around. Everything is derivated in Judaism by virtue of the TREE, including even the hebrew
language. 

At the very least, we can show that the Trionfi is not the original Tarot by refering to the Tarot of the Bohemians.

 EditFilter Idea 

I originally posted this to Triplestop, but he suggested I ask you.

I've been looking at the edit filter documentation and I would like to contribute a possible candidate to look for new editors changing birthdates, a fairly common and sneaky problem. I'm not looking for full edit-filter rights, but I would like to help develop the appropriate filter. If you don't have the time to deal with this right now let me know, and I'll engage someone else.

I am new to the syntax, but here's my general format right now:

(user_editcount < 50) & (article_namespace == 0) & (lcase(added_lines) rlike """"dateofbirth *=+|birth ?da(te|y)|\(born |\(b\. """") & (lcase(added_lines) rlike """""""") & (lcase(removed_lines) rlike """""""")

Where I have  is the birthday searching regex I've been working on. Below is what I've developed so far. I haven't tested it extensively, but I've thrown it against a few BLPs and it works fairly well. It finds the usual ways that birthdays are presented, either in template, or in lead, for example (b. January 1, 2010).

Here's the regex
(date of birth *=+|b\.[^&-]+(&.dash;|-+)|\( *born |birth ?da(te|y) *=+|\() *(([0-3]?[0-9],?)? *(jan|feb|mar|apr|may|jun|jul|aug|sep|oct|nov|dec)\.?[^0-9\.]*([0123]?[0-9],? *)[12][0-9]{3})|(\{\{birth[^\}]+\}\}).*$

I don't know how to check for what specifically was edited, as in if a numerical value was changed. Is Edit Filter able to do this sort of thing? I welcome any other ideas you have. I assume this will require more work. But please let me know how to push this along.

No problem about Patton, it happens. ) In regards to Maghakian's infobox, the infobox is meant to be a quick summary of information about the person, containing only key information succinctly. The ribbon icons, in my opinion, detract from the information, serve to clutter the infobox and are not the correct place for them to be. I know you pointed out the case of the John Shalikashvili article, but I think the ribbons presented in such a way in the infobox in that case is unhelpful and a waste as most people will not know what each of the ribbons denote and will have to either hover over them or click on them to find out, which should not have to be the case: it should be presented just there. The article is the place where extensive information and detail is intended to be discussed, as you have done in Maghakian, but not too much information placed in the infobox. As for the service medals, as noted above the awards section of the infobox is only meant to relate the notable awards one received, and not service medals. Maghakian is notable for his awards of the Navy Cross, Silver Star, Bronze Star and Purple Heart (the ones that should most definitely be listed in the infobox). If he had just received the service medals like everyone else who had served in his unit or the same theatres of war that he did, then he would not actually be notable enough for inclusion here.

When did I say I find anything offensive. I merely told you what ethnic Macedonians think. Do you even know English? I did not state my view at all. If I was irredentist I would have said temporary control. And I said nothing about Bulgarians anywhere. I only mentioned the blue corner, never  Blagoevgrad/Pirin (the Green corner if you will). Laveol, you are suggesting that the blue corner is Bulgarian! You are offended because my """"irredentism"""" conflicts with yours. And now, I will, for the first time, point a Bulgarian editor to hypocrisy. Feel free to point me to sarcasm. 
And Avg, the ethnic Macedonians call their land, in their everyday speech, plain vanilla Macedonia as well.

""""Slavic Macedonia"""" doesn't work because the Bulgarians and Serbs and even Poles are also Slavs.  My proposal works better (in a discussion) as it is actually neutral.

 Vienna 

Dude, seriously.  WP:RS and WP:V don't get thrown out the window just because Mary Jo Foley of microsoft-watch.com provides an unattributable and unverifiable quote from a so-called """"spokesman"""" about the change in name.  Nobody at Microsoft with a name has bothered to come out and say """"Yes, the name is Vienna"""" in the last few days.  Doesn't that strike you as somewhat odd?  We can trace back the origin of almost every other recent code name to a blog entry by a developer team, or a page on Microsoft's web site.  Not this time.  I'm not going to bother with renaming back to Windows Blackcomb, since you'll probably change it back to Vienna without bothering with that nagging Wikipedia requirement of verifiability.  This isn't a race.  
Okay... What's the point of these constant reverts back to Blackcomb? I'm really sure now that the codename is """"Vienna"""". The change was recent, let's not make a big deal of it not being mentioned everywhere. No offense, but you seem to like the name Blackcomb much better than Vienna. Get over it. It was changed. Now it wasn't only Scoble who confirmed it. My guess is they were trying to keep it secret for some reason. Several sources claim it's """"Vienna"""", so let's keep it that way. There were rumours about """"Longhorn"""" being changed to """"Vista"""", but later it was confirmed. Let's just leave the article alone for right now. —  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The Alfred de Grazia that was purported to have done all the things attributed to him by you is the same as my father; however, I cannot say why he said any or all of these things, or what the Army actually used him for, or if and why he posted the picture as him when it wasn’t and isn’t. I replaced in the place I found it the actual picture of him posing in front of the stacked bodies at what I am sure was Buchenwald, and Anne-Marie von Hueber – de Grazia said that he had also been to Auschwitz. I did not know this until she made the statement on Facebook in connection with the photo. My father tended to self-aggrandizement and liked Jews who he thought were very smart. He also tended to be a Sophist, or sophistical. He could have written a lot with intent, or purposively. But still, why are you choosing this man, who did so much for humanity, as any sort of model for any sort of behavior that you might find unfavorable to your interests? The Nazis made their own bed and dragged the German people into it. The bombing of cities had already begun in WWI with German Zeppelins hitting London. The British chose to be the first to bomb German cities in WWII, but it would have started with German bombers in due time. I wandered the battlefields of Europe for years, just feeling the pain and division; even in my own mind and family, and grew up with young men and women who had lost their parents in the War, years before. Find someone else to pillory. Al de Grazia should be left in peace; he did his duty and it was rough from the start. He accomplished miracles considering all. Wikipedia is not good for you or your cause; it is filled with crap that anyone with a brain can see is made up to suit the authors’ purposes. I believe the term is “whole cloth;” right from the weaving mill and ready to be cut to suit the maker’s needs.

Section break
For everyone who thinks there is merit to ID sufficient to give it the rather prestigious label of """"theory"""", please review the List of scientific societies explicitly rejecting intelligent design as well as the actual findings of Dover v. Kitzmiller:
What is more, defense experts concede that ID is not a theory as that term is defined by the NAS and admit that ID is at best “fringe science” which has achieved no acceptance in the scientific community…ID is reliant upon forces acting outside of the natural world, forces that we cannot see, replicate, control or test, which have produced changes in this world. While we take no position on whether such forces exist, they are simply not testable by scientific means and therefore cannot qualify as part of the scientific process or as a scientific theory.
And this is from the defence - that would be the very people who purport to believe ID is science.  For good measure, here is The Skeptic's Dictionary 
Intelligent design (ID) is an anti-evolution belief asserting that naturalistic explanations of some biological entities are not possible and such entities can only be explained by intelligent causes.*  Advocates of ID maintain that their belief is scientific and provides empirical proof for the existence of God or superintelligent aliens. They claim that intelligent design should be taught in the science classroom as an alternative to the science of evolution. ID is essentially a hoax, however, since evolution is consistent with a belief in an intelligent designer of the universe and with an unlimited number of other metaphysical myths.
And here is The Skeptic Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience:
Essentially, most neo-creationists (among whom there is quite a bit of variation) do not believe in a young Earth, accept micro-evolution (though recently so do some classical creationists), don't believe in the literal truth of the Bible, and don't even call themselves creationists - the preferred term for their version of things is """"intelligent design""""
The list article alone contains 25 scientific societies - and major ones at that.  May I also bring attention to the National Center for Science Education's 60 societies opposing creationism - of which intelligent design is merely the latest version.

I don't think it wise to hold this article to so much scrutinty that no one can edit it without challenge. That would be totally wrong. SO, I suggest we move on from notability to real consensus building as to whether it should be in. For a lack of a better term, let's just call it """"Notable-enough"""". Is it notable enough to be in there, under wiki rules. I have said that it is not the most important thing around. It is not. I understand that others think it may not be.

Inspirational ending quote:

Juicy

Juicy was an American musical duo consisting of siblings Jerry Barnes and Katreese Barnes. The group is best known for the songs """"Sugar Free"""" and Beat Street feature song """"Beat Street Strut"""". The name comes from Mtume' number-one R&B; hit """"Juicy Fruit"""".

Career
They debuted in 1983 with a single called """"Don't Cha Wanna"""" and album Juicy. The album entered the charts following year. 

In 1984, their song """"Beat Street Strut"""" was released by Atlantic Records. The song appeared on the 1984 musical-drama film Beat Street and its gold-certified soundtrack. The song was moderately successful on Billboard Dance chart, peaking #46 in July 1984. 

In 1985, Juicy recorded their second album It Takes Two, which features an answer record to """"Juicy Fruit"""" called """"Sugar Free"""". It peaked at #13 on the Billboard Black Singles chart and #45 on the UK pop chart, and was certified Gold. Another singles from the album include """"Nobody But You"""", reaching number 59 on the R&B; chart.

After the uncharted album Spread The Love was released in 1987 for CBS Associated Records label, the group did not enter charts any more.

 Tram and trolleybus articles 

Thanks for your comments.  I have been a big fan of electric powered urban and rail transport, particularly in continental Europe, since the early 1980s, and that, of course, is the subject matter of the newly translated template (and the articles that are and will be linked to it).

Until recently, en.wiki did not have anywhere near as good a coverage of Italian rail topics as it should have.  Although I can't speak Italian, and can barely read it, translating Italian is relatively easy with the assistance of Google translator.  Since November last year, I have therefore translated approximately 100 articles about individual Italian railway stations.  Now that almost all of the important stations are covered in en.wiki, the it.wiki articles about Italian tram networks and trolleybus systems seemed to be the logical next step.

Since I started work on my latest project, I have also discovered that there is very comprehensive coverage of individual tramway networks and trolleybus systems in de.wiki, so I will start translating some of the de.wiki articles soon.  In the meantime, I have just created one very long overdue en.wiki article, Trams in Milan (not fully translated as yet), and will be creating another long overdue article in the next few days.

Which brings me to a query about nomenclature.  There's quite a bit of material on both it.wiki and de.wiki about individual classes of trams (and trolleybuses).  However, I'm not sure how translations of those articles should be named.  If an article is about a generic make and model (eg Siemens Desiro), then it can just be named as """"make model"""".  But if a tram class is unique to a particular network, the issue of naming is less clear.  There are several en.wiki articles about Australian trams that are named in the following form: W-class Melbourne tram.  However, that form doesn't seem right to me.  I would suggest that a more appropriate form would be Milan series 1500 tram, which is a form consistent with the naming of many articles about locomotives (eg British Rail Class 47).  What do you think?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 In comedy 

Deleted the """"In Comedy"""" section: it adds nothing to an understanding of Jack Ruby, and distracts from the rest of the article. Any significant influence by Ruby upon comedy could be placed in the Popular Culture section; any Ruby-related jokes are gratuitous at best.   

 In the popular culture section: NOFX reference 

I don't think the reference to the NOFX song """"The Man I Killed"""" being about Jack Ruby is correct. From what I've read, and my interpretation of the song, it is about someone (perhaps Fat Mike the lead singer) killing a world leader (most likely George W. Bush). Unless a good reference can be found to support the claim I don't think it is appropriate to have this claim listed under the """"Popular Culture"""" section. I am going to remove it for the time being.  
 

 Nixon-Ruby connection  
A number of sources claim that there was some sort of connection between Jack Ruby and Richard Nixon (  ). Even if this is all conspiracy nonsense, it should be somehow addressed in this article so people looking for information on the connection can get the truth and won't continue on to some other less reliable source .  
(learn to spell...)

I've seen a physical piece of paper (which of course I couldn't yet scan) at the National Archives in the 70s. (My father was a good friend of E. Raymond Lewis, Librarian of the House of Representative IIRC, and I would hang out talking to whomever while they met.) Rubenstein had been subpeonaed by McCarthy's Subcommitee on Investigations; Nixon sent a note (which is what I saw) saying that Ruby had been working for him in a confidential capacity and it would be unacceptable to question him in public (I forget the exact wording); the subpoena was revoked. I think the paper might have been in the congressional record.

See WP:NOR, crank.   

 I've got a xerox copy of that document, and it has a zip code on the FBI letterhead.  That's a bit of a problem, since there were no zip codes when it was supposedly was written.  It's actually widely admitted to be a forgery.  John McAdams

 A case has been made for explaining the ZIP code  that the one-page xerox is really a composite of 2 different documents. The top (on FBI letterhead) is a half-page undated typed note (""""NOTE: Extra copy. Inclosure not verified by official report. Return to file. This is sensitive.""""), used as a transmittal sheet, stapled on top of full page underneath. Only the bottom half of the full sheet dated 1947 is seen.  If this is correct, the presence of the ZIP code on the letterhead need not affect the dating of the bottom half. See discussion here.  

First let me say I don't know how to add new sections on Wiki or Wiki Talk pages so I'm putting this here even though it's not related to Nixon; It's related to JFK's VP, Lyndon B. Johnson. I'm absolutely speechless after looking through this article that Johnson's name isn't mentioned, anywhere, considering he WAS Kennedy's running mate, and there's a very famous picture of Johnson smiling at a man off in the crowd who is winking back to Johnson as if they're sharing some secret joke *while Johnson has his hand on a bible and is being sworn in.* And I think it's a very possible motive for having JFK assassinated; he *would* and *did* advance to the presidency upon JFK's assassination.

Something else I found that I stumbled across using StumbleUpon.com was that (according to the articles i read, which were full of hotlinks to other information around the web) according to that author, all 4 presidents who'd been assassinated *were* assassinated because they opposed 'central' banking or 'artificial' banking (not sure what the proper term would be), that is, the fact that the Federal Reserve is a privately owned corporation which prints money for a fraction of the cost of the face values of what they print. Something to think about.

I'll go look through my stumbleupon history to see if I can find the article I'm talking about in the previous paragraph, but there are quotes by Lincoln and Kennedy talking about how they were against the 'Federal Reserve' for lack of a better term, I'm not sure what it was called historically, I doubt it was always call",0,0,0,0,0,0

There is no free speech on Wikipedia?
You are nuts, there is a lot of freedom of speech in the US and you abide to that.
You can't just make a law that will prevail over the US constitution. Unless you are willing to rewrite the bill of rights, for that we have to kill Dr MLK jr. again.
You allowed this computer hacker Pablo something, located overseas, probably in some garage in a little town in a country called argentina to ignore, laugh at our bill of rights.
He censored my contributions, probably he could not even understand what was in those, his command of the language is just poor, you allowed him to show how powerful he is.
No freedom of speech on wikipedia, and i am sure our fathers have fainted back there in Philadelphia after that statement.
This pablo does not need to worry about the us constitution, the bill of rights or anything like that, probably he does not even care about the bill of rights of his own country.
He can do as he pleases and block the freedom of speech of any US citizen at will.
His intrusion in our territory shall not be tolerated, he can do as he pleases in his country but in ours, he just can't.
I strongly recommend in order to preserve the little prestige left for wikipedia you don't allow this overseas people what you allow them to do.
I see now why he thought the law was a threat, probably it is back there, here is some precious possession of ours that did cost blood and we shall defend it.
I emailed the Attorney General, but i doubt this pablo even knows where california is.
Now that i know his whereabouts i think his connections with carrio are closer than what i thought.
I am writing these reviews on behalf of a friend located in argentina, she told me she was too scared to do that from there and requested my help.  I thought she was making that up but now i believe her and i shall continue to protect her from these pablo&friends.;

That being said, mike, the phrase """"the magnitude of the regression, across varying degrees of relatedness"""" isn't quite on the mark.  What Jensen did was show that not only does the IQ gap exist in itself, but that the populations regress towards the same differentiated means as found in the IQ gap.  It basically reinforces the claim that the IQ gap is a real effect.  now, he and Nesbitt argue over whether that regression is better explained by genetic or environmental theories (and in fact Jensen's structural equation model suggests that both genetics and environment play a role), but that issue has not been decided yet.

 """"aeroplane"""" vs """"aircraft"""" 

Sorry to bring this up after all the debate and resulting conclusions, but the WP definition of aircraft is at odds with standard world-wide ICAO terminology.  From Title 14 FARs Section 1:

Aircraft means a device that is used or intended to be used for flight in the air [includes all flying machines, with or without wings]. Thus, balloons, flying pigs, and F-15s are all aircraft.

Airplane means an engine-driven fixed-wing aircraft heavier than air, that is supported in flight by the dynamic reaction of the air against its wings [refers to aircraft with wings only]. Thus, an F-15 is an airplane, but a balloon is not an airplane.

[Airplane and aeroplane are mostly interchangeable]

The FAA definitions are identical to the European JAR definitions and the Canadian CARs definitions because all personnel licencing is based on the basic ICAO standard.  I notice this confusion happens throughout WP on many topics because of the large number of inexperienced editors. Perhaps it's just the enthusiastic revisionist ignorance of youth?  Regardless, the incorrect use of terms in technical articles is grating, and it degrades the usefulness of Wikipedia.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

What follows is a discussion with DonaldRichardSands transferred from my user talk page   

Dear DonaldRichardSands,

The link for the revised article is here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Boris_Berezovsky_(businessman)/new 
Thanks for taking a look. From what you wrote above, I understand that you do not mind replacing the old version with the revised text on the main page. I would very much want to get other editors of good will involved. All best  
I think it would be more accurate to say, the revised outline seems to resolve the sensationalist approach of the old version. However, and this is what will take the time, the old version does have merits which should not be lost. There is an energy among some people to show that Berezovsky is a mafia-like boss. When I told a friend about Berezovsky and the accusations of his involvement as such a boss and how I would like to email him and ask him to donate a picture for the article, my friend expressed shock and dismay that I would risk my life so. The article needs the balanced outline of the revised version but should deal with both sides of the view of him. This balance is what takes the time. I would enjoy helping. Your energy for the article is obvious. If we could get an editor who wants to portray Berezovsky as a mafia boss to agree to the balanced outline and then to enter some careful rules of collaboration, the article could strengthen quickly. In the article I am working on presently, one other editor is active and he is very critical. But, he and I have finally agreed to work with the talk pages and to talk more civilly with each other and things are progressing much better. Similar cooperation could happen for the Berezovsky article. Rely on Secondary Sources. Insist on a conservative, scholarly examination of all aspect of Berezovsky's life. And, yes, I still want to email him, ask him for a picture, and perhaps go for coffee. )      
Dear DonaldRichardSands, thank you for your input. Of course, Mr. Berezovsky is a highly controversial person, and I think, all these controversies are reflected in the revised text. But he is a major figure, who influenced Russian political history over two decades, and his biography deserves professional approach not only for his own sake, but for the sake of the whole Russia block on Wikipedia. With respect, the belief of """"some people"""" that Berezovsky is a mafia boss is an opinion, which is not supported by facts. If an opinion is poorly sourced and potentially libelous, it has no place on Wikipedia, regardless of how many people may hold it. Otherwise we should change the rules and make Wikipedia a collection of opinions supported by a majority vote. Under current rules, we should work with well sourced facts. The facts in this matter are as follows. (1) That particular opinion has originated from a single source (Mr. Klebnikov), whose antisemitic bias has been noted by three respectable independent sources. (2) The publication (Forbes), which printed his opinion has unequivocally retracted it as lacking any evidence in a libel court hearing. (3) Dozens of profiles of Mr. Berezovsky in major world newspapers, which adhere to the standards of fair and responsible journalism - including serious Russian sources - do not repeat these allegations. I believe that Wikipedia should adhere to the same standards. The revised article states the sourced facts as they are: there was an opinion voiced, which was then discredited. Of course, if anyone can quote another reputable source, which supports this opinion with evidence, it should be mentioned. Since I am going on vacation, I have put the revised text on the main page, and leave it for the community to compare it with the previous version (which can be accessed via History tag), amend, challenge and comment - as long as it is done by the rules. The last thing I want is another edit war. On the other hand, seeking consensus is just one of Wikipedia rules. Avoiding pushing opinions, and removing unsourced slander is another.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Your role as copyright enforcer 

You removed a video link I posted to the [Jimmy Rushing] entry, insinuating, but offering no evidence, that it the posted video violated copyright. Google determines what videos violate copyright on YouTube, and I fail to see why you are in a better position to know than Google is, unless you are the copyright holder. Google removes videos when a valid claim of copyright violation is made, and before that there is no assumption (and certainly no proof) that the video violates copyright. You have not demonstrated that you have special copyright expertise, and even that would not give you special knowledge about a given video. You merely draw you own conclusions, which override those of Google, and do as you wish. If I can't know if a video violates copyright, how can you know? And if you do not have such factual knowledge, why do you assume a violation, and the right to delete a link? Please explain any knowledge you have that the video in this instance violates copyright. If you do not have that factual knowledge, please explain why you have the right to act as if it does violate copyright. Do you know of any legal precedent for holding a person or entity liable for linking to a copyrighted item without knowledge that there is a copyright violation? According to the Digital Media Law Project, """"As long as you do not know that a work infringes someone's copyright, then you cannot be held liable for contributory infringement for directing users to that work."""" The mere mention of the video being available from Rhino  which has now apparently allowed the video to go out of print  is not proof of copyright ownership. If one exists, the copyright might have been leased to Rhino, or there may be no copyright, or one that permits a YouTube posting. Thanks.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have a soft spot for under appreciated thing that are interesting so wanted to improve the article. I've done what I could with my awful Danish to English skills and was in need of help. I think the page is 75% done and just needs a wee bit more love. If you'd like to help I could set up a sandbox for it so we can work on improving the article. When that's done we'd need to get some sources as it only has one right now. Then we'd need to get the information into English. Once it's in English I can do most of the editing. I'd also like to find someone who'd be able to get some photos. Maybe since it's a museum they'd probably even help if we emailed them. So what do you say, are you in ? (  )",0,0,0,0,0,0

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion.

Those are newspaper articles, not my original research.  They tell us that Dr. Kade made so many mistakes reporting on dead people that he was asked to resign, and he did.  Wildhartlivie has removed those additions to the article several times.

Wildhartlivie insists on removing from the article a report (that I sourced) about certain Los Angeles sheriffs' officials believing Kupcinet may have died from an accidental fall.  I explained that their investigation led them to believe that, but Wildhartlivie insists on calling this """"gossip"""" by """"the police.""""  That is a cracked fantasy.  They were sheriffs, not police.  They don't gossip.

I ask that the person continually undoing my modest constructive work be himself blocked, and that my specific contributions be locked in so as to end this foolishness.

What constitutes vandalism is the repeated removal of large sections of text- multiple paragraphs at a time- from sections such as """"Background"""". Furthermore, it would be more appropriate to move the two languages you continue to cite to an """"Administrative Languages"""" blurb, and include the rest of the languages beneath that in a blurb called, """"Other Languages"""", or something to that effect.

Fletcher is wrong about the number of vehicles, but the facts about them can be established separately. Assumptions about them cannot. We can establish 1941, but not 1945.

Never edited an article before, so thought i'd put these ideas and bits of information here first for people to comment on before messing about with stuff and making a mess of things.

Firstly, the FGD for Units 3 and 4 is now complete and operational.

Also there are now plans for a multi fuel CHP plant on the site. http://www.sse.com/Ferrybridge/TheMultiFuelProject/

And a carbon capture pilot scheme is currently under construction, which will capture 1% of the flue gas from Unit 4 (equivalant to 5MW). http://www.sse.com/Ferrybridge/TheCCSProject/

The figure of 218 million litres of CW an hour doesn't really mean anything to me... it's quite a difficult thing to imagine... maybe stating something along the lines that this equates to the 4 CW pumps delivering roughly 60 tonnes of CW every second... or enough to fill an olympic sized swimming pool in under a minute, might help people visualise just how much 218 million litres an hour is.

There is a note stating """"Not to be confused with Eggborough Power Station or Drax Power Station"""" at the beginning of the article, which is fair enough as they all sit in a line within about 15 miles of each other and are easily confused, but there's no similar note on either the Eggborough or Drax articles.

 Some thoughts:
Yes, if you define """"environmental journal"""" as any journal that ever published an article dealing with environmental issues. Determining this will often involve original research and interpretation.
No, if you go by the inclusion criteria given in the lead of this list: this journal clearly is not """"focused"""" on environmental issues, even though they may be included in the scope.
No, if you go by the journal's homepage, which not even mentions the word """"environmental"""".
So it all depends on how you want to define """"environmental journal"""". Personally, I would define that as a journal dedicated to environmental issues, not just any journal that occasionally also publishes something related. But I also know that David tends to go for the latter, wider definition -)   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Dear DCstats and ERosa 

Starting a new section here because the preceding is hopelessly indented.

DCstats and ERosa, you are mistaken in your thinking. Jdannan and Avenue are quite correct. I know this might be very difficult for you to accept. You claim to have references supporting your interpretation. However, I think you are misinterpreting the statements from the textbooks you are reading. I can't speak for your """"petroleum industry statistican"""" friend. My guess is that you conveyed your misinterpretation of the situation to him/her. I have a ph.d. in mathematics and after reading this talk page and thinking I was almost losing my mind, I consulted with several other ph.d. mathematician and statistician friends of mine who confirmed that Jdannan and Avenue are indeed correct. And the interpretation given in the article is basically correct as well. In fact, it's the interpretation I've seen given in every stats book I've looked at.

Some references, since these seem to be very important to people:

""""Warning! There is much confusion about how to interpret a confidence interval. A confidence interval is not a probability statement about θ since θ is a fixed quantity, not a random variable."""" — Larry Wasserman, All of Statistics: A Concise Course in Statistical Inference, p. 92
""""CAUTION! A 95% confidence interval does not mean that there is a 95% probability that the interval contains μ. Remember, probability describes the likelihood of undetermined events. Therefore, it does not make sense to talk about the probability that the interval contains μ, since the population mean is a fixed value. Think of it this way: Suppose I flip a coin and obtain a head. If I ask you to determine the probability that the flip resulted in a head, it would not be 0.5, because the outcome has already been determined. Instead the probability is 0 or 1. Confidence intervals work the same way. Because μ is already determined, we do not say that there is a 95% probability that the interval contains μ."""" — Michael Sullivan III, Statistics: Informed Decisions Using Data, p. 453
""""The idea of interval estimation is complicated; an example is in order. Suppose that, for each λ, x is a real random variable normally distributed about λ with unit variance; then, as is very easy to see with the aid of a table of the normal distribution, if M(x) is taken to be the interval [x − 1.9600, x + 1.9600], then (1) P(λ in M(x) | λ) = α, where α is constant and almost equal to 0.95. It is usually thought necessary to warn the novice that such an equation as (1) does not concern the probability that a random variable λ lies in a fixed set M(x). Of course, λ is given and therefore not random in the context at hand; and given λ, α is the probability that M(x), which is a contraction of x, has as its value an interval that contains λ."""" — Leonard J. Savage, The Foundations of Statistics, p. 260

Your misunderstanding seems to be based on an inadequate grasp of a few facts:

 The population mean μ is a fixed constant, not a random variable.
 The endpoints of the confidence interval are random variables, not fixed constants.
 A statement about the level of confidence of a confidence interval is a probabilistic statement about the endpoints of the interval considered as random variables.

The issue about whether μ is """"known"""" or not is a complete red herring. What matters is that μ is fixed, not whether it's """"known"""". This also has absolutely nothing to do with probabilistic interpretations of quantum physics, good lord.

Let me go through an example which has the most simplifying assumptions. Suppose we have a normally distributed random variable X  on a population with mean μ = 100 and standard deviation σ = 16, and suppose we select samples of size n = 100. Then the sample mean X-bar is a sampling distribution defined on the space of all possible samples of size 100, and it has mean μ = 100 and standard deviation σ/sqrt(n) = 16/sqrt(100) = 16/10 = 1.6. A 95% confidence interval for μ based on this sampling is then given by (X-bar − zα/2*σ/sqrt(n), X-bar + zα/2*σ/sqrt(n)) = (X-bar − (1.96)*1.6, X-bar + (1.96)*1.6) = (X-bar − 3.136, X-bar + 3.136).

Now, note the following facts:

 The confidence interval is defined to be a random interval, i.e. the endpoints of the confidence interval are random variables defined in terms of the sample mean X-bar.

As one sees at critical moments, in The Times of London, or The New York Times, reportage can be devastatingly skewed. This goes for the mainstream press. The second proposition has nothing to do with either comprehensiveness or accuracy of reportage, but rather 'who cares. I like it, I want the readership to think this way'.

McMartin was one of several cases in the 80's involved in this debate. The best NPOV book on McMartin is Hechler, D. (1988). The Battle and the Backlash: The Child Sexual Abuse War. Lexington,Massachusetts: Lexington Books. This book covers both sides of the issue extremely well with interviews from the actual participants. Hechler's work has appeared in the NY Tinmes, the Village Voice and the New York Daily News. Earl is biased and so is Underwager's IPT. 

In regard to Prometheus Books, it has been stated on another wiki talk page:
""""Prometheus books is not a credible source on child sexual abuse. Their """"Human Sexuality"""" section throughout the 80s and 90s was edited by Vern Bullough, who is also a board member of Paidika, the Dutch pro-paedophile magazine. Under Bullough's editorship, Prometheus published a range of pro-paedopihlia titles, including the Eberles, as well as the book """"Children's sexual encounters with adults"""" in which a number of contributors espoused pro-paedophile views. I am astonished at the inconsistency with which certain Wikipeida editors attribute credibility to different sources on child sexual abuse. The Eberles' history with child pornography is in the public domain and it has been for almost twenty years. Now we find editors claiming that the Eberles (and John Earle, a contributor their book) are considered credible sources, whilst all sources (including major newspapers, magazines and a trial judge) indicating that they are child pornographers are not credible sources.""""

 Authorship 

Over at the Barack Obama article, there was some discussion of whether his book authorship merited lead position.  I argued (and consensus seems agreed on this), that very brief mention of those best-sellers should be in the lead, particularly since the books have their own article section.

In McCain's case, he is co-author on several books (none seem as prominent in sales-ranking and the like), and there is not a separate section on them.  However, I still wonder whether there's any sentiment that authorship should still get a clause in the lead. ×talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Yes, just recently, we proposed renaming the page from Transsexuality to Transsexualism, so it appears to be a very controversial issue.  As the Definitions section of this article suggests, not everyone will be happy with any single term.  For examples, Jennifer Diane Reitz refers to """"transsexuality"""" and Lynn Conway refers to """"transsexualism.""""  If you search """"transsexuality"""" and """"transsexualism"""" on Google, you will find more hits for """"transsexualism.""""  Reality Resources, an ex-trans ministry, frequently uses """"transsexuality,"""" and to me, """"transsexuality"""" sounds like a sexual orientation.  Of course, some people do not like either of these terms.  For example, some people prefer Benjamin's syndrome [], but that definitely sounds like a disease.  Andrea James has proposed the term """"interest in feminization"""" for transsexual women who plan to transition.  She feels like that term would encompass all persons who transition from male to female, or desire to do so, including those who do so for non-traditional reasons.  While I do not feel like the medical community should stop people from transitioning for non-traditional reasons, I also feel like this terminology suggests that transsexualism is a chosen behavior.  I feel that transsexualism is an inborn characteristic, but I don't believe that it should be called a disease.  All said, I feel like Transsexualism is the best title for the Wikipedia article on the subject.  Given the recent replies to this comment, and the recent move debate, I feel like consensus has already been established.

There is no conclusion over three sons or seven.  Why it is considered necessary to place a full stop after mentioning three sons.  Therefore it is necessary to evaluate the reliability of reference being emphasized with the availability of an ISBN # and its publishing in English language by a foreign expert (his dignity is recognized, but critical view is our right).  In my discussion  Abu Mikhnaf is one of primary sources per norm of social science (history).

 Primary sources: relate to an event, written by someone who experienced or witnessed the event in question by  letters, memoirs, journals, speeches, manuscripts, etc.

Secondary sources: function to interpret primary sources.  Secondary sources interpret to assign value and draw conclusions about the events reported in primary sources.
 
When evaluating primary or secondary sources, the very basis warrants to know:
(i)How does the author know these details
(ii) Was the author present at the event or soon on the scene? 
(iii) Where does this information come from, i.e. personal experience, eyewitness, or reports written by others?

Thus the reliability of an scholar (Wilferd Madelung ) belonging to a belated period (20th century) depending on single source of tenth century does not sense to overrule the very old primary source of 8th century  which is not only supported by millions of naqvis/naqavis  of the world (particularly the sub-continent) but also evident from the various published (secondary) sources e.g. Gulzar-e-Naqi (Riaz ulnasab), compiled with the help of 38 books annexing 40 pedigrees, by a family member of Ali Naqi Naqvi .  The writer belongs to well educated family, his two elder brothers were college principals in colleges of  Punjab.  Among his brothers Dr. Sohail Bukhari was an authority in Urdu Literature  in his time besides being an author for Punjab Text Books for school and colleges.

In view of above discussion the section which provides explanation to the confusion in numbering and names of sons should remain in the main article for research and reference, in terms of EN-WP being  the tertiary source.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The Potsworth and Co. (Midnight Patrol: Adventures In The Dream Zone) artical could use a bit of a change. I think I know how old each of the characters in the show are. I mean, they should have complete profiles.

Potsworth (Age 10, 60 in human years): The sarcastic dog who usually has a stern voice when he enters the Dream Zone.

Nick (Age 6): The little boy who is the flying superhero when he's in the Dream Zone. He is assisted by his stuffed toy dinosaur.

Rosie (Age 8): Nick's big sister. An annoying brat who gives the group a very hard time, despite her usefulness.

Keiko (Age 9:) The Asian-American girl who rides a flying skateboard. She is energetic, very optomistic, and sounds a bit more like the leader of the group.

Carter (Age 10): The black boy who is an expert artist. In the Dream Zone his magic paintbrush can bring many things to life. He is Potsworth's owner.

Please give this advice some thought. It could become very useful for the artical.

 From Norway; Denmark; Iceland; Scotland; England(Bristol etc.); Wales; Ireland; Basques & Others(""""again"""",more data) 

by Gunnar Thompson

""""On DeVirga's map, the northwestern continent is called """"Norveca.""""  This title, appearing under the symbol of a crown, identifies the huge land as a province under the sovereignty of Norway.  Other maps also show a huge land attached to northern Norway.  On the 14th-century Andreas Walsperger map, the region is called """"Regnii Norwegie"""" (the realm of Norway); maps by Sebastian Munster (1532) and Joachim Von Watt (1534) call the region """"Septentrio;"""" a circular map by Battista Agnese 1543 shows """"Terra Nova"""" extending from Norway to the North Pole.  

Maps that portray a huge northern territory reflect the 1261 proclamation of King Haakon IV extending Norse sovereignty over all the lands from Norway to the North Pole.  The """"North Pole"""" he had in mind was the magneticnot the geographic pole.  A 14th-century writer, Philippe de Mezieres, reported that Norway's overseas realm was so extensive that it took three years for the king's tax collectors to complete their rounds and return to Bergen.  

One of the territories that Haakon annexed in a 1262 treaty along with Greenland and Iceland was an otherwise obscure place called landanu or """"New Land.""""  The Kongfriget Norges historie (1778) identified an Icelander named Rolf as the discoverer of this New Landalso known as Nyalandin 1258.  It was also identified as part of the North American mainland.  Bishop Gissur Einarsson noted that the direction of sailing to Nyaland from Iceland was southwest.  In that direction lies Newfoundland and the Gulf of St. Lawrence.  

The region had many names that changed over the years as successive waves of Europeans landed on its shores.  As late as 1347, Icelanders referred to Newfoundland as """"Markland""""which was an ongoing source of lumber.  Sailors from Bristol called the coastal isles """"the Icelands.""""  Circa 1350, a Spanish Franciscan reported an isle called """"Ibernia"""" in the northwest Atlantic that was under Norse sovereignty.  After that date, Bubonic Plague swept through European cities devastating maritime centers.  Norway was particularly hard hitforcing the abandonment of overseas colonies.  English, Portuguese, French, German, and Danish merchants fought over the western isles.  After 1380, Denmark took control of Greenland, Iceland, and mainland in eastern Canada.  The """"new"""" Danish mainland appears on the Claudius Clavus map of 1424 as """"Gronlandia Provincia.""""  Thus, the name """"Norveca"""" was already archaic by the early 15th century when it found its way onto DeVirga's map.  Portuguese maps of the early 16th century feature the names of Joao Fernandes (The Labrador) and the Corte-Real family along the East Coast of North America...""""  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 212.113.163.75   
Gunnar Thompson has also published on Marco Polo’s secret missions to Canada and the ancient Egyptian colonization of Mexico. He has compiled an """"Extensive collection of evidence (maps, artifacts, and cultural similarities) of voyages to North America before Columbus, by Phoenicians, Norse, Celts, Britons, Jews, Greeks, Irish, Romans, Japanese, Hindus, Indo-Sumerians, and Chinese. Native Americans are the first discoverers, occupying the Americas for at least 300,000 years."""" (from the Laura Lee radio show website) He is as reliable a source as Gavin Menzies. He has told me that the word hurricane comes from the ancient Greek.   

Well, the dear Dougweller can claim quite rightly in many cases that the relate of Marco Polo could be speculation, however Gunnar Thompson cites the words of his own reporting and book, book attributed to him, Marco Polo, as a documental source for these claims in the American Pacific coast, as well as indirect sources more speculative on the several centuries later(and even from his time) world maps, wich indicate where the lands designated by the Chinese and by the Venetian-Dalmatian Explorer were.

This article's introduction does not mention anything about men raping women, or """"male-on-female"""" rape as the parlance may be. This is by far the most common form of rape and the one that is most often analysed or mentioned in virtually all fields of human history, including both the scientific and artistic. Is this deliberate, or has it somehow just been overlooked? 115.166.47.100  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Page Title
Simliar to Talk to the Hand: Live in Michigan, I would like to suggest that the title of the page be moved to Disc One. I don't think the subtitle should be included in the page name, as I think 95% of the public looking up this album would look up the main title, and not include the subtitle. I can see the argument both ways, but I think the most useful title would simply be Disc One. It is similar to how Bob Barker is an article, while his full name is Robert William Barker (which is the lead of the article) - they don't have to match.

I have studied theology for years, and all that I can say is Liberals haven't a clue of what Christ meant about everything because they twist the scriptures to agree with their own egos. There is no such thing as a Liberal Christian, only a Liberal.

80964bc23ecd4a50,""":Thanks Tom - that's a much better summary than the previous one. One question: in the comparison of UKIP's performance to that of other parties, I think saying that the SNP polled less than UKIP could be misleading for non-UK readers. If I didn't know that the SNP only stood candidates in Scotland, I'd get the impression from the current text that UKIP did much better than the SNP on average. But knowing that UKIP put up candidates across the country (while the SNP didn't) gives quite a different impression, since, of course, the SNP polled much better than UKIP everywhere it put up candidates. So for the benefit of non-UK readers, in the section comparing UKIP's performance to that of the Lib Dems and SNP, perhaps it might be helpful to add """"ahead of the Scottish National Party (who only contested seats in Scotland)""""?

I won't make that addition unless you approve, though.

Oh, one more thing - do we have a quote from a UKIP official or UKIP press release on the official reaction to the election result, or a link to an article about it? It would be interesting for readers to see what 'spin' the party put on what might otherwise be regarded as quite a disappointing result for them.

I did that because that article seemed to be slanted towards a pro-Lefebvre position as well.  I felt that it did not have enough information to give people the chance to make an accurate assessment about Lefebvre.  The two people who I called arch conservative were exactly that.  Both men tried to derail the Second Vatican Council, and fought both John XXIII and Paul VI and all those who were in favor of reform every step of the way.  I don't know if Thomas Jefferson actually said this or not, it was a quote the Jefferson character made in the movie 1776 that he felt that King George III was a tyrant even if they did not include call him a tyrant in the Declaration of Independance, so he thought they might as well call him a tyrant.  And I have talked to Catholics who were treated rather badly by church officals - especially in the times before the Second Vatican Council.  Why do you think that sexual abuse of children became such a crisis for the church?  It was because of a long standing church policy to protect the clergy at the expense of the laity.  I remember talking to an older gentleman whose grandfather left the church for a while, he didn't exactly what his grandfater's reasons were, but he said it probably wasn't hard to guess why.

Even if people were supressing the faults of the new mass, it appears to me that the pendelum swung the other way, that the article was stuffed full of criticism on the new mass, but anything on the benefits was totally removed from this article.

Thanks for getting back to me. I share your """"opinion that we should point out clearly and repeatedly that both Republicans and Democrats are clearly to the right of the demographic center,"""" and I agree it seems like a minority opinion in the mass media. But I still view it as a neutral opinion. With this view, the idea that """"the Democratic Party is almost evenly divided between left-of-center liberals and more centrist moderates"""" seems irrelevant in the lead of an American Left article. I thought that text written in the prefaces to the Encyclopedia of the American Left might hold sway over other editors by serving to dispel disagreements about the scope, lead, and the most important subdivisions of topic. That might be the case in German Wikipedia, and I think it's the case here in science and history articles, but, in politics, perhaps no academic authority can ever hold sway over editors here. This means that even the foundational defining terminology of US politics articles like this one with a potentially ambiguous scope might never be stable. But I respond easily to baiting, I bait other editors myself, I can be sarcastic, and I'm an infrequent (but confident) contributor.

The article states that only one Libero player is allowed per team.  However, Beginning in 2008 for FIVB competitions, and beginning in the 2011-2012 for USAV competitions, two liberos are allowed per team, although only one may play at a time.  In fact, FIVB rules _require_ two liberos to be designated if a team has more than 12 players on the roster.

FIVB refernce:  http://www.fivb.ch/thegame/TheGame_VolleyballRules.htm
USAV reference: http://usavolleyball.org/news/2011/03/09/usav-rules-commission-meeting-highlights/41322

The article also states that the rule allowing Liberos to serve has trickled down to juniors competitions.  That is not entirely true.  USAV rules do not allow Liberos to serve in any sanctioned event, although AAU Volleyball does allow Liberos to serve.  Many USAV regions allow Liberos to serve in events that do not serve as USAV National qualifiers.

I'm not looking to out anyone or anyhting, it's just gotten to the point that well, i think there's a reason, and other people too, to read about this fascinating community activist. I was telling Will beback, i've been a memebr of Sierra club since i was akid, my parents enlisted me and made some rather large donations in my name throughout my life, and i've done the same wiht my own children. It's a cool way to move things forward, like that movie, but hoefulyl much less trite. Anyhow.. what's the good word with you today? I think of our battles more like the old warner brothers cartoon with the coyote and the sheepdog, punching in before they set out to undermine one another. Because that's whats happening here, I'm actualyl writing some pretty solid stuff here, and you and will beback are bending over backwards to break rules and uphold them agaijnst me. Look, over at biff rose, there was a flargrant violation of the 3rr standard, and I pointed out that to Will beback that each time i made that violation, i was blocked and banned. i see that the person who did it this time was not blocked or banned. so you know, I've got a whole list of these that is being sandboxed by another ip, to follow up on, as i told will, you need to play fair for me to adhere to any standards you want to uphold. you can't just block an article, because true information is being disseminated through it. Well you can, but it's against the wiki rules, and so you are in violation, though i don't really think you care, anyhow, hope you keep your head above water, and I'l lsee you at the fights, so to speak.

 Wrong Focus 

I'm new here, but it seems to me that this page, as it now reads, IS about IHD/CAD, to the exclusion of the remainder of cardiovascular disease.  While it may be true that the term """"is usually used to refer to those [diseases] related to atherosclerosis (arterial disease),"""" I would suggest that this is careless usage, to which this page need not subscribe. So how should the article be structured? I'd say look to the table of contents of a textbook of CV disease for a model, with the change that I would pull out all atherosclerotic vascular disease into its own section, with links in the relevant anatomic regions.  Other headings might include Congenital Heart Disease, Valvular Heart Disease, Cardiomyopathies, Dysrhythmias and Conduction Abnormalities, Diseases of the Coronary Arteries, Diseases of the Pericardium, Diseases of the Aorta and Great vessels, Brachiocephalic and Cerebrovascular Disease, Other Peripheral Vascular Disease, Arteritides, Systemic Hypertension, Thrombosis and Embolic Disease, Other Venous System Disease, Diseases of the Pulmonary Vasculature, and Heart Failure and Transplantation. Some discussion of cardiovascular anatomy, physiology,diagnosis, and therapy would also be germane. Although each of these would basically be a definition with a link to its own page, I think the result would be to give the reader a better picture of the vast scope of cardiovascular disease.

 Bob Ross edits 

What we have here is a failure to communicate.  You stated that certain details pertaining to Bob Ross' life were not pertinent to the article. Specifically, details about his wives.  This information isn't trivial content.  Details about lots of notable individuals' nonnotable spouses permeates Wikipeda unrelentingly.  Properly sourced information about significant events in people's lives, such as marriage, divorce, births/deaths of loved ones, is not the same as saying, """"Bob Ross like cheese,"""" even if one were to find a source for that statement.  Your deletion of this isnormation does, in fact, fly in the face of well-established community-driven consensus.  Examine any biographical article, and you will find lots of information, [presumably] properly sourced, that you, as an apparent deletionist, might find strictly banal and useless.

It should be noted that the details about his wives was very short, noting only their names (obviously their last names were Ross, and unless their maiden names were in a source, one could not publish it) and the durations of their marriages.  Such a short, sourced statement is surely not worth pursuing like this.  Yuor edits were reverted because you did not provide a valid reason for soing so.  As per the widely-held and practiced policy of including any properly sourced information in biographical articles mentioned above, you need to discuss first changes which go against the consensus.  There's always the possibility that you might provide convincing arguments, and even influence consensus-driven policies  but definitely not in this case.  The users who addressed your actions are well-seasoned, and are familiar with the consensus to the point of being able to enforce it on matters presicely like this without needing to query the community.  For you to be able to make the changes you made  as I said  you must discuss it first.

Making changes that violate policy can easily be construed as vandalism  it suggests that you either didn't read or care to abide by the community standards  but that is incorrect.  The policy of vandalism states, in part:Any good-faith effort to improve the encyclopedia, even if misguided or ill-considered, is not vandalism. Even harmful edits that are not explicitly made in bad faith are not considered vandalism. For example, adding a personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism — it's just not helpful, and should be removed or restated.It appears to me that you indended to be helpful, as a deletionist, but it flew in the face of established community consensus and policy.  I will remind those editors who made those comments to you about vandalism the specific of policy, but the bottom line is: do not remove properly sourced information from Wikipedia without prior discussion.

 Perpetual Virginity 

The article currently states: """"After giving birth to Christ, Mary did have sexual relations,"""" and """"In the little time that Joseph was still around after the birth of and they had several more children.""""  Certainly some people believe these assertions, but they don't belong in an article that presents the Roman Catholic Church's Marian dogmas.

The article also says that: """"Mary did break her vow by the grace of God.""""  The writer seems to mean that God gave Mary a free pass to have sex but remain a virgin.  That really needs a citation, because I've never heard anything like it.  The RC Church teaches that Mary was really and truly a virgin her whole life, and other people believe she had sex and bore children, but as far as I know, no one teaches that she had sex, but God was okay with it, so we call her a virgin anyway.  Without a citation, this statement should go.

 northern hemisphere 

Hello there,
look at this sentence, there is a (useless) triple enhancement:

""""Nowrūz is the traditional Iranian new year holiday celebrated by Iranian peoples, having its roots in Ancient Iran.""""

It's great to make reference to the origin of a festival, but this seemed a little overprotective (??!).

I would keep the reference to the origin (having its roots in Anciant Iran) and change the sentence in the following way:

Nowrūz [Persian: ...] is a traditional new year holiday having its roots in Ancient Iran and being celebrated by various people in the northern hemisphere, partly as the day marking the beginning of spring.

The BNP was modernised by Nick Griffin and has no links to Holocaust denial or Nazism. Digging up 20 or 30 year old quotes is irrelevant. You can do that for all parties as many change their ideology. The modern Labour party are not the traditional Labour party, just how the Conservative party are no longer traditional Conservative Tories. During the heydey of the British Empire the Conservatives were pro-imperialistic and supported the colonisation of other countries, do you think the modern conservatives under Cameron support that? Another example: The Green Party in UK used to strongly oppose drugs, yet now they support drug-use and want to ban the prohibition of drugs and support the possession, trade and cultivation of cannabis. So they went from being anti-drug to pro-drug. The modern BNP has no links to Holocaust denial. Secondly, the comment about Nick Griffin and the RAF bombings is a typical distortion of what he said by anti-BNPer's. What Nick actually said is that the RAF should not have bombed German innocents (children and woman) as many were murdered in the Bombing of Dresden. Likewise he also opposed the bombing of innocent British civilians by the Nazis. Also the last claim modern BNP members sieg heil, i presume was a comical claim. It has no basis in fact.

 SC Info 

Im almost positive that this is not the place I'm supposed to be responding, but there is no reply link at your message.

Part of the reason for my """"offense"""" is that I think your being unfair in referring to it as spam.

If I was just posting """"Hey! Come visit my site,"""" without any contribution, that would be one thing. But, when I posted anything from my own site, I had news attached to it.  You didn't have a problem when I posted the news of the departure of the producers and writers of the movie and linked to RopesOfSilicon.com, and you also didn't have a problem when I posted the purchase of Dreamworks by Paramount and linked to Yahoo! News, but when the news happened to come from my site, even if it is legitimate news, it's spam. I happen to be in a position that I have connections and can make alot more news than other sites. But that shouldn't make the news any less relivant in getting it to people. 

When I take the time and care enough to try to make sure the info is correct, only to have it removed and replaced by the same wrong information, it's very frustrating, and it does come back to us at Ubisoft. For example, someone came to the official forums and said they saw on Wikipedia that Tom Cruise had accept the role of Sam Fisher in the movie. Well that is not true. So I had to correct him and that has happened a few times with a few wrong pieces of information. Which is why I went to the extent to find the correct info. But, if you are not in control of the other pages...and judging by the fact that the incorrect info that I removed has been replaced, it seems those who are in charge seem to perfer having incorrect information posted, so my hands are tied. 

Frankly, I'm getting tired of trying to help and getting railed back for what I see as petty reasons everytime. 

Also the back and forth with you removing my fan page from the list and the two other sites to the bottom, only to have me move them back was something I did because I have problems with an owner of another fansite following me around and well..not being nice.

Questions and comments

Ms. Barber wrote: """"In a united effort, the ISSR Licensed Breeders only produce approximately 200 pups per year""""  '''''

Ms. Barber-How many of those puppies were """"produced"""" by your kennel?  What specific health testing do you conduct on your dogs?

You, and those supporting your club/registry, have been respectfully asked for this information numerous times during this discussion yet you continue to ignore these legitimate requests, while appearing rude, insulting, superior-minded, and frankly an entirely offensive and inarticulate representative of this breed you """"founded"""" and the other breeders affiliated with your registry.  I certainly hope other breeders affiliated with your organization do not present themselves to the public in the same way you do, as I can't imagine anyone with any intelligence and self-esteem would be willing to tolerate such unprofessional behavior, much less purchase any puppies/dogs from people who conduct themselves the way you have in this discussion.

You claim a lot, but you provide no independent support for your claims, only your own writings on your own website.  You claim anyone """"producing"""" dogs other than you or your registry are frauds, yet you are unwilling to prove how this is true other than offering some photos YOU have taken of these dogs and your own rantings, as evidence. You claim breeders unaffiliated with you are """"in it for the money"""", yet:

You produce more of these dogs than almost all other breeders combined, through your wholly and co-owned breeding dogs.  Your website (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/upcoming_litters.htm) for this Winter alone, shows you are """"producing"""" ELEVEN litters at New Zion and through co-ownership breedings.  Eleven litters, even conservatively speaking, could easily produce over 100 PUPPIES!  And, you are planning for 20 more litters next Spring and Summer!  You also currently list over 25 stud dogs and over 25 females you are considering for breeding!

You charge a lot of money for each puppy you produce ($900-$2500+).  After the puppy-buyer has paid you for a puppy from a certain litter, you also contractually reserve the right, at your own discretion, to substitute a puppy from another """"compatible"""" (again, based on your own determination) litter and you will not provide a refund if they are do not agree with the """"substitute"""" puppy you decide to offer them.
(see: http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm.....""""New Zion reserves the right to substitute any litter of equal/higher value that is compatible with your exact requirements"""").

It appears that, once monies are given are given to you, your contract does not allow for any refund under any circumstances, nor could I find any instances where you contractually assume any financial responsibility whatsoever for any puppies you """"produce"""" who display congenital/hereditary problems requiring resulting astronomical/extensive veterinary fees.
  
You require your puppy-buyers to not only pay you for puppies at the time you """"produce"""" them, but you also require puppy-buyers to sign contracts promising future puppy and breeding rights (for breedable dogs, you require the dog's new owners to either give you some of the puppies that dog produces in the future and/or you require they allow you to use that dog in the future to sire new litters of your own), in order to profit from the dog not only now but also throughout his/her life. 

You have no stated policy on your website page (http://www.newzionshilohs.org/Policies_N_Prices.htm) re: your own personal policy/commitment to rescue and make/find a home for for any of the puppies/dogs you """"produce"""", should they become unwanted, homeless and/or end up in shelters or in abusive situations.

Your """"Policies and Prices"""" make no mention of a contractual requirement by you (with the signed contractual commitment of your puppy-buyers) to spay/neuter their new """"pets"""", in order to reduce overpopulation of this breed and dogs, in general.  I could find nowhere on your website where the horrifying statistics of unwanted/euthanzied dogs in the U.S. (2 million +, including 25% of which are purebred dogs) is responsibly addressed by someone actively promoting and engaged in the proliferation of this explosion.
 
Your website does not list any independent references, such as recommending/governing affiliations (i.e. Better Business Bureau), approval ratings (i.e. OFA, Penn-Hip, CERF), or other professional organizations to which you belong (ie. American Dog Owner's Association, the the Delta Society [therapy], dog training or agility organizations, etc.), only your own dog club(SSDCA), you own dog registry (ISSR), and your own",0,0,0,0,0,0

A siege mentality has gripped the headquarters at Fortress Dickinson; security forces have been mobilized and some officers are calling for implementation of the dreaded “block” maneuver. (A bemused Miss Dickinson has been placed under house arrest by the authorities – “for her own protection”.)

A small edit: In the “Reception” section (formerly “Dickinson and Her Critics”), Susanne Juhasz is paraphrased as offering essays from a “female"""" perspective (from her book Feminist Critics Read Emily Dickinson). Historically speaking, I wasn’t aware there was a “female” outlook on any matter. I’ve never doubted there was a “feminist perspective”, however.

 First project for Wikipedia 

As of April 2, 2008, edited this page as first project.  Any comments appreciated.  Did the following:
 From previous posts, learned that page direction was for terminology, not necessarily biology. But added more succinct genetic information citation to definition, making the body of the text heavier.  Added short biology section because of this.
 Found more usage of the term """"black sheep."""" Depending on the group culture using the phrase, it was either positive or negative, so further clarified usage by splitting the term into two groupings with citations and examples for each.  I know Baa Baa Black Sheep was removed once.  However, it is an example of the use of the term.  The other examples should be obvious.  If not how do I clarify.
 Did not find a standard template for citation on this page.  Would anyone let me know what the standard for this page is and how it was chosen, and I will go back and change.  Thanks.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Emancipation (1862) was closely tied to growing power of abolitionists as McPherson says:
By the beginning of 1862 the impetus of war had evolved three shifting and overlapping Republican factions on the slavery question. The most dynamic and clearcut faction were the radicals, who accepted the abolitionist argument that emancipation could be achieved by exercise of the belligerent power to confiscate enemy property. On the other wing of the party a smaller number of conservatives hoped for the ultimate demise of bondage but preferred to see this happen by the voluntary action of slave states coupled with colonization abroad of the freed slaves. In the middle were the moderates, led by Lincoln, who shared the radicals' moral aversion to slavery but feared the racial consequences of 
wholesale emancipation. Events during the first half of 1862 pushed 
moderates toward the radical position. One sign of this development was the growing influence of abolitionists. """"Never has there been a time when Abolitionists were as much respected, as at present,"""" rejoiced one of them in December 1861."""" [End quote from page 494  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Borges' Apocryphal Quote 

Is """"apocryphal"""" the correct word.  In Royce's The World and the Individual, available on Archive.org, he begins a discussion (in the Supplemental Essay) as follows: """"let us suppose, if you please, that a portion of the surface of England is very perfectly levelled and smoothed, and is then devoted to the production of our precise map of England. That in general, then, should be found upon the surface of England, map constructions which more or less roughly represent the whole of England, — all this has nothing puzzling about it. Any ordinary map of England spread out upon English ground would illustrate, in a way, such
possession, by a part of the surface of England, of a resemblance to the whole. But now suppose that this our resemblance is to be made absolutely exact, in the sense previously defined.""""  Royce goes on for awhile.

Borges may have massaged, and shortened considerably, the quote, but the idea is still Royce's (it is also discussed in Russell's Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy).

""""Military occupation is effective provisional control of a certain power over a territory which is not under the formal sovereignty of that entity, without the volition of the actual sovereign.[2][3][4] Military occupation is distinguished from annexation by its intended temporary nature (i.e. no claim for permanent sovereignty), by its military nature, and by citizenship rights of the controlling power not being conferred upon the subjugated population.""""

Therefore, if a country annexes a territory AND grants citizenship, that territory should NOT be placed in this list. (That does NOT mean it's not occupied, but it is NOT military occupation.)

CJ DUB Keeps Calling Users Ignorant - Violation of Wiki Rules
Hi, Deb. The user, CJ DUB continues to break Wiki rules by disrespecting others by insulting me. He stated the following, yet again: You are in fact ignorant. He also claims to be an editor """"with experience"""". A serious wiki editor with experience does not speak so ignorantly and disrespectfully about others. A wiki editor examines facts without judging others, as is the case in discriminatory environments. Therefore, he is not a wiki editor and is most likely a poser. He seems to be a sensitive american """"man"""" who feels everyone is against him or his american way of thinking. He must understand that not everyone will like him or his background. I have also noticed that another user named, Seb, may be the same person. He's probably using dual usernames in wiki.

Thanks for your message on my talk page. When I voted keep for Tom G. Palmer, I justified it by writing that """"Google returns 13500 hits for the query """"Tom G. Palmer"""" cato [3]."""" """"Tom G. Palmer"""" alone returns 34,900 hits on Google [4]. So on this point, my vote is not necessarily inconsistent (34,900 > 19,000).
Well, sure, but that's weak""""35000 is notable, but 19000 isn't"""". Come on. That's not serious.

But even if you had 50,000 hits on Google, I might also have refrained from voting. This is mainly because I am concerned about you putting so much pressure to have your own article. If I was in your position, I would probably keep my distance from the discussion. You are a primary source of information for yourself and, in that sense, your position might be biased. I am not sure whether your attitude fits with the Neutral point of view policy (which applies to articles, but probably also to the way the encyclopedia should be created as a whole). I don't know, and I prefer to abstain from the vote.
Understandable, and advice well taken and appreciated. But I am a justice seeker. I really don't care as much if my entry is deleted or not, as for whether I fight to vindicate my unfair treatment (as I perceive it). Here I was, many moon ago, minding my own damn business, and someone tells me I have a Wiki entry. Interesting. Then someone says it's up for delete. What do I care. I really don't give a damn. But some jerk says it's non-notable (okay by meI didn't konw Wiki policies on this at the time anyway); and vanity. Implying I did it, as self-promotion. This pissed me off. I rebutted the latter charge and did not even mention the notable charge. Later, many months later, someone tells me he has initiated VfD for Palmer's site. Now this was right after the Wiki entries of some CLEARLY notable friends of mine were vandalizedHans-Hermann Hoppe, Lew Rockwell with ridiculous charges of racism etc., of the same type made by Palmer. So I figure, let's take a look at his entry. I did so, and in the ensuing VfD debate, realize there are actual policies on this; I studied them and thought, """"son of a bitch. I qualify. By their own policies. These wikinerds should not have deleted me. And to top it off, the same one who voted to delete me is voting to keep Palmer. Something ain't right."""" So, instead of dishonestly putting up my entry anonymously or through a meatpuppet, I did it myself, nothing hidden. And instead of rolling over and playing dead as I did last time, I decided this time, I will make noise and make sure that if I have anything ot say about it, the voters will be made aware of the policies. That is all. If a fair evaluation of my site and aplication of the policies leads to a good faith vote to delete my entry, I don't care. But what do I see? Peopel who vote to keep Palmer up on the grounds that he is openly gay, or has a large number of publications, or has 13000 google hits, voting to delete me, even though I have similar criteria. It makes it seem arbitrary to me. So can you blame me for monitoring this a little bit, and being a bit frustrated at the seemingly arbitrary actions of some people? Nom.

 First point - it was not only treated as mental illness, but as criminal activity.
 Second point - you should only refer to 'homosexual romance' in the lead if there is a section that deals with 'homosexual romance' in the body of the text, as the lead is a summary of what is in the body, and having ten sources does not count for much unless the terms are unpacked somewhere in the main text.  All these seem to show is that people like Giddens (who is a notable sociologist, but no authority on sexuality, sexology,  LGBT studies in general or homosexuality in particular) use the term.  If there were a link to an article Homosexual romance, which shows the term can be taken for granted, fine - otherwise it needs to be dealt with in the article before it can be inserted into the lead. 
 Third point, my earlier comment about this was made with ironic and humorous intent, because I have only come across the term 'romance' used in this context, at conferences, ironically or critically.  Just because a term is used in sources does not mean that it can be used in the lead when it is not in the text, for example, """"Homosexuals deserve to be executed or tortured""""   """,0,0,0,0,0,1

Wikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending
By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""",1,0,1,0,0,0
