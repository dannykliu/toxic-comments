 Spanish mistranslation? 

In the introduction, Guzmán is referred to as a """"luchador enmascarado"""", which is then translated as """"professional wrestler"""" in English. However, """"to mask"""" in Spanish is """"enmascarar"""", and therefore """"enmascarado"""" would be more along the lines of """"masked"""".

 Afro-Cuban Sahrawis 

The source cited for the claim that Afro-Cubans are descended from Sahrawi refugees is misrepresented in the article. It does not claim that the Afro-Cuban population is partially comprised of Sahrawis, or that a significant number of Sahrawis immigrated to Cuba. Indeed, the article never even mentions the term """"Afro-Cuban"""". Rather, it details someone's (dubious) claims about Sahrawi children from the Tindouf Camps being abducted to la Isla de Juventud for military training.

 The Cramp Twins 

The Cramp Twins is an animated series created by cartoonist Brian Wood. The show was produced in association with Cartoon Network Europe. It is about Lucien Cramp (Kath Soucie) and Wayne Cramp (Tom Kenny), not-so identical twins who live with their hygiene-obsessed mother (Nicole Oliver) and their Western-obsessed father (Ian James Corlett) in the fictional town of Soap City. Wayne and Lucian's personalities clash, and they rarely get along. Wayne has a friend called Dirty Joe (Lee Tockar), who owns a dump, and neighbour Wendy Winkle (Reverend Andrew Sparks) has a crush on him, but he hates her. Wayne's and Lucien's teacher is Miss. Hillary Hissy (Demi Buchanan, who also plays Tony's mom Lily and Mrs. Winkle). Lucien's friends include environment-friendly Tony Parsons (Terry Klassen who also plays Tony's dad, Seth) and Mari and Luke Harrison (Adam Little).

Season one premiered in the UK in September 2001 on Cartoon Network (UK) and on February 2, 2002 on CBBC on BBC One respectively and has reached high popularity with children. Season one ended on 21 June 2002. A second season premiered in Autumn 2003. Season 2 finished in 2003.
Season 3 started in 2004 and ended in 2005. Season 4 began in 2006 and ended that same year.
The show is currently licensed to Cartoon Network.

The show was originally canceled in the US in February 2005, when Mew Mew Power (aka """"Tokyo Mew Mew"""") was airing in its slot February 19, 2005, and it was originally intended to be a sneak peek for the series to air September 2005 with Cramp Twins continuing to air there, but 4Kids TV decided to cancel The Cramp Twins to put Mew Mew Power in its slot. A press release went out about a possible 3-part finale answering any unanswered questions, but the show returned in the summer of 2006, and later with more new episodes.

 Main characters 
 Lucien Cramp: Lucien is the smarter of the twins, but also considered the 'eco-loser'.  Gentle and sensitive, Lucien is frequently bullied and name-called by his brother; Wayne's favourite choice of addressing Lucien is """"Girlpants"""", but he sometimes calls Lucien a """"nerd"""". Lucien enjoys science, nature and is a vegetarian. Lucian longs for a pet, but due to his mother's extreme cleaniliness rules, he is denied owning any.  Secretly, Lucien keeps a worm farm under his bed, that only Tony, Mari, Wayne and Wendy know about. It is shown in many episodes that Lucien has a fear of clowns. He has many skills, including knitting, and has shown interest in playing the harp. Lucien likes going to Soap City's only swamp (the only place he gets peace from Wayne, who is afraid of the place) where Tony lives. Lucien is technically the older twin as he was born first in the opening credits. Lucien Cramp is voiced by Kath Soucie. 
 Wayne Archibald Cramp is the blue-skinned antihero of the series. He is taller, destructive, and the less intelligent of the twins. Wayne is obsessed with junk, which he collects and hides in his room; he spends most of his time at the junkyard, owned by only friend, Dirty Joe. Unlike Lucien, who loves the swamp, Wayne is terrified of the place, and also has a fear of frogs. Wayne is constantly annoyed by Wendy Winkle who has a crush on him. Wayne's only love is anything sugary, his main source of energy, and if he is deprived from it, he becomes tired and speaks nonsense. Wayne likes to give the impression that he's the best-behaved of the twins to his mother, and sometimes Miss Hissy, but in truth, he likes to manipulate to achieve his goals.  Sometimes Lucien who gets in trouble for Wayne's behaviour, although in many episodes, somehow the tides turn and Wayne is punished by pure coincidence. Wayne is vo",0,0,0,0,0,0

TO: KMH03 AND MARK

I am not slipping.  I have taken responsibility for my actions said I should not have created the bio of duncharris.  I shouldn't have done this.  Two wrongs do not make a right.

I also realize that mark is right I should use the term non-BSF.  

Thirdly, I am very aware via the creationism article that it is the minority view people who are not respected.  Are they given a chance to present info or is the article overrun by the consensus contrary to the minority view article policy?  I think we know the answer to this question.  But Wikipedia doesn't really care about respecting minority view articles in many cases.  Now I realize that some want to take a cookie cutter approach and let the consensus view dominate, overrun and even trample minority view articles.  This is not Wikipedia policy though.  

Now you can say I am unreasonable but it is simply not true.  

Now I saw Mark's """"assuming that Wikipedia doesn't work"""" comment.  I do think it is fair to ask if the creationism article is working.  Is it working?  Is there much civility like some (not many) internet creation-evolution forums I have seen?  No there isn't civility. It is a failure.  I believe Wikipedia fails in issues like creationism.   I think it is a failure due to mismanagement or due to premeditation.   But I believe it is a failure.  I know it is not blasphemy to say Wikipedia fails in issues like this.  Minority view people are often not respected at Wikipedia even in minority view articles.  

Now why was the Conservative Christianity repeatedly changed to Christian right?  Is it because of magnaninimous generosity of a person in the non-BSF camp? No it wasn't.   

Perhaps in the future articles like creationism will have the minority view truly aired and done in accordance with the current Wikipedia rules.  But I think this is unrealistic at this time as I see no commitment at this time.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I think the pic of a 1979 Austin Allegro is actually a Vanden Plas either 1500 or 1750 model. You can tell by the raised grille attached to the bonnet - the VP was a luxury (sic) version of the Allegro mark 2 model produced between 1975 and 1979. It had a classic wood and leather interior including walnut picnic tables recessed into the backs of the front seats, and the different frontal treatment you can see hints of in the pic. The VP was something of a freak - who was it aimed at in marketing terms and did anyone ever associate Allegros with luxury motoring?

But he didn't find any significant separate Tamil power near Jaffna. Same story goes with Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa(ruled 1055–1110), the greatest warrior king in SL history. Two greatest warrior kings in Sri Lanka never found such a Tamil settlements in Jaffna before 12th century, but now people have found a big invisible settlements.

Speedy deletion of """"Nora Istrefi""""
 A page you created, Nora Istrefi, has been tagged for deletion, as it meets one or more of the criteria for speedy deletion; specifically, it is about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how they are important or significant, and thus why they should be included in an encyclopedia. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, and the guidelines for biographies in particular.

You are welcome to contribute content which complies with our content policies and any applicable inclusion guidelines. However, please do not simply re-create the page with the same content. You may also wish to read our introduction to editing and guide to writing your first article.

Nice graph.  When you get the time, would it be possible to add the unit of the """"perch"""" (sq. rod) to the chart?  As the acre is defined as 4x40 of these originally, it is a more important unit than the square chain to have a comparison.

 —this user has been stalking me and reverting all my comparatively larger edits without providing enough reason. One example, just because one of my sentences contained one slightest (but I'm not too sure if it was incorrect at all) scientific inaccuracy he rashly reverted the whole edit when he could have enriched the article by simply correcting the inaccuracy with good sources.

I sincerely think he is trying to start multiple edit wars at once. He thinks just because I don't have many administrator friends he could revert my changes. His primary claim is that none of my sources are reliable but his/her sources are. Just look at his contributions. His contributions are mostly deletions of the edits he doesn't like.

1. Moved the Hariakhan Baba paragraph above Post-Yogananda Claims. According to that entry Hariakhan Baba taught from 1860 (before Paramahansa Yogananda was born) to 1924 (before the publication of the Autobiography of a Yogi in 1946). People accepted and revered Hariakhan Baba as the Babaji since pre-Yogananda times. The timing of his appearance also coincides with Lahiri Mahasaya's Kriya Yoga initiation from Babaji (1861).

2. Corrected a minor spelling error from Hari Dasa to Hari Dass.

3. Added Roy Eugene Davis' name and book as support for the Mahavatar Babaji/Hariakhan Baba theory. Basically,  to show that there is someone from the lineage of the author of Autobiography of a Yogi who agrees with Dass and (Mahendra) Baba's conclusion. Roy Eugene Davis was ordained by Paramahansa Yogananda himself in 1951. So, for someone like him to agree that this Hariakhan Baba is the same as the Mahavatar Babaji mentioned by his Master and venerated by all legitimate kriyabans from the Lahiri Lineage is not a light matter.

Liberal Bias claim
A common quote in this site (how do you call that reoccurring quote? Leitmotiv?) is that """"reality has a liberal bias"""", from Colbert, and it tries to make a point that even though their pages are in fact snarky and sassy their pages are the reality of the subject and have no progressivist or liberal agenda or bias despite so-called conservatives saying so it is in fact biased if it doesn't fit their ideology (that's called denialism). Also, the site points out frequently on the fact of """"quality over quantity"""" of a side of the argument, and that not all sides of an argument have equal weight. For example, in the environmental situation of acceptance the only two viable arguments are that data overwhelmingly supports climate change and the contra is that correlation doesn't equal casuation, but the arguments that science is anti-environmental and that the environment is against God are poor arguments for and against, respectively.
I am trying to say we should include that and to eliminate the """"progressivist view"""" classification of this site. This comes from both experience and newspaper sources. Thank you.

Considering the controversy about the definition of Druz as Arabs, we'd better of say """"Arab and Arabic speaking people that are not Jewish"""". The Druz may or may not be Arabs, but they definitely speak Arabic.
Some of the 150,000 Palestinian Arabs who became Israeli citizens in 1952 were refugees who managed to return to their homes before the borders closed. By the way, I wonder if we should write """"Palestinian and Bedouin Arabs"""", as the Bedouins often distinguish themselves from the Palestinians.
""""Occupied East Jerusalem"""" - let us do without the complicated discussion about the legal status of Jerusalem. Saying that East Jerusalem was unilaterlly annexed is quite enough in terms of supplying required information.
It is improtant to emphasize the special status of the Druze.
It is important to emphasize the special status of Jerusalemite Arabs.
The regard of Israeli Arabs as an indiginous minority is a theory or a claim. It is not a fact. It is very hard to determine which of the Arabs in Mandatory Palestine is an immigrant from other parts of the Middle East, or a descendant of such an immigrant, and which of them is actually indigenous. This way or another, the conflict between Israel and its Arab citizens cannot be said to be the mere result of a universal phenomenon of tension between indigenous people and newly established authorities. The main cause of tension is the Israeli Arab conflict.

Neutrality tag
The tagged section is not only neutral, it is primary verification of what JfJ claim to believe. It would be very odd indeed if the communism article did not reference communist sources for what communists believe. The section states what JfJ believe, it makes no claims about what Wiki believes, nor what the editor who put it there believes, nor what a reader should believe. It is therefore an verifiable NPOV reporting of a group that is itself obviously not neutral. My reading of this article is that although technically neutral in its presentation, it starts by presenting all the negative views of JfJ. That does not seem logical. A neutral reader wants to know firstly what JfJ believe, then what others say, neutral, pro and con. Example:
Jane Doe's netball team's mission statement says, """"Play quality netball ...""""
The Netball League recently described the team as """"dedicated, but lacking experience""""

Oversourcing
Hi, I thought I should explain why I reverted the edit you made to Warwick Castle, especially considering it takes a lot less effort to hit the revert button than it does to go through and prune references. I understand that you were consolidating references since just one is used for most paragraphs. However, per WP:V """"material challenged or likely to be challenged, and all quotations, must be attributed"""". Therefore I think it's better to have a generous amount rather than just one per paragraph. Moreover, if someone was to add information to the article from another source it could wrongly appear that all the information in the paragraph before the reference comes from the new source (unless of course the editor was careful to duplicate sources).

The user then preceded to launch a very abusive and malicious attack on me. He linked my 710 contributions [166] and entirely falsely wrote 'Not so ridiculous when you look at his contributions which seem to be all geared around the May elections. This user seems to be on a campaign trial on behalf of UKIP'. This is called blatantly misleading other editors, surely in violation of policies such as WP:AGF, WP:BITE, WP:CIVIL and WP:NPA. I have nothing to do with UKIP. I am not a member of any political party. I am not enrolled to vote in the United Kingdom. So these are ludicrous allegations. I have created 21 pages, 16 non-related to the elections. Articles I have created such as Endorsements in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 are very important and been widely edited and viewed. I have also created articles such as United Kingdom general election, 2015 (Wales) in accordance with precedent. I have worked hard on the project for good and in good faith.

What did I say that was uncivil? Mellowed Fillmore said 'It is my view that AusLondonder is clearly not here to build an encyclopedia. He is likely to remain a problematic editor and I'm not sure that any more patience needs to be shown' - yet I have created 27 pages  including Endorsements in the United Kingdom general election, 2015 and List of European Union member states by GDP growth.

 Sandstein apparently thinks that everything not being a compliment is ipso facto derogatory. There is also another possibility that hasn't crossed his mind: neutral. No English dictionary has (derogatory) or (offensive) label next to the definition of the word nationalist. However, in Sandstein's native language the word nationalist does have a derogatory undertone. Here is the link to the definition of Nationalismus in the most authoritative German dictionary (Duden), where it has a label (meist abwertend) which translates into English as """"mostly pejoratively"""". In German it's used as a pejorative, in English it isn't and it belongs to the neutral register. I suspect that Sandstein mixed two entirely different usage contexts for otherwise related words with the same meaning, in two different languages.
 It was not my intention to make any kind of personal attack. If you look at my edit history you can see that my behavior has been nothing short of exemplary. I have never heard anyone complaining about being offended by calling them nationalist. More often than not, it is I who is on the receiving end of abuse which sometimes provokes abrasive responses. If someone said that they are offended I would've stopped.
 Sandstein's condescending comment about me apparently failing to understand something (what?), justifying the """"educational"""" component of the block by such lack of understanding is borderline insulting. Perhaps Sandstain trains his dog by taking punitive measures when puppy does something wrong, but may I remind him that we're dealing with human actors here that are not Fachidioten with blinders that only respond to Pavlovian stimuli dispensed by the master with his block^Wstick. An administrator should not be making such comments when blocking other users. They shouldn't probably be thinking of editors as offenders that ought to be subject to corrective measures (blocks) for their infractions (policy violations), but at least they could keep it to themselves.
 OK, let's say I crossed the line with nationalist name-calling. I didn't mean to use derogatorily, but I can accept that it is not an appropriate conduct. But what does that have to do with ARBMAC and the excessively long block? As I far I can see the guidelines on the WP:PA require posting a message on user's talkpage and seeking mediation. None of that happened. PA is a community-approved policy which takes precedence over anything ArbCom decides, or any admin """"broadly interprets"""". A week is something that trolls and bad-faith editors get. Surely it's too excessive?
 This whole circus is a result of content dispute with the user who submitted the enforcement request. It was not made in good faith and his ulterior goal is to remove me from editing a set of low-importance articles that are currently not in a NPOV state. He also submitted a sockpuppet investigation against me with evidence such as last-year's sarcastic comment of mine on a sister project, as well as edits that I made years ago. With all that in mind, I must say that Wikipedia community has become very effective at giving partisan editors tools to target undesirable editors - a Byzantine collection of policies which admins overzealously enforce without a second thought, and without thinking of a big picture. Admins in fact are incentivized not to involve themselves, which basically gives the enforcement gun to POV-pushers which are intimately acquainted with all the glorious details of the relevant wikilese. I urge admins to think outside the policy-enforcing request-observing mode and think whether blocking me in any way helps to resolve the pending content disputes.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Wow, that was quick.

I had been in the midst of composing the following reponse.

Thank you for the magnanimity in overlooking my latter comments, AGK, you're too kind.
First of all, though it is true that I learned that NYB is an attorney from Wikipediocracy, there are no entries in relation to you on that website, as a simple search via their search engine would have indicated had you taken the time to check, as a courtesy .
The fact of the matter is, I learned about your status as an undergraduate studying law from your own User page Hi, I'm Anthony, an undergraduate and Wikipedia contributor from Scotland. where you make it a point to make it prominent that you are:
an undergraduate
studying law
from Scotland
Well, good for you. Maybe someday you'll even become an attorney, after you graduate from college, and maybe pass a bar exam, that is. 
Now, the edit summary of that diff of your eliminating that information from your User page is sort of interesting(off-wiki stuff probably isn't interesting to most people)
And what is even more interesting, is that it occurred on August 24, just after you'd posted fallacious FoF about me and voted to indefinitely topic-ban me from the Tea Party movement article. 
Why is it, do you suppose, that I, for one, would not be interested in such information about you?
Clearly there is a question as to your WP:Competence, as far as I'm concerned, but I will defer to Jimbo Wales on that point for our purposes here, as you are undoubtedly aware that there is an appeal of the decision you are heavily implicated in on his Talk page. 
At any rate, I have to get some sleep now, so I will simply ask reviewing admins to visit Jimbo's Talk page and follow the links. I've linked to you Talk page there as well. 
As far as I'm concerned, and I have stated this on the Tea Party movement PD Talk page, WP:SPADE is the operative policy here.
I've merely repeated information you'd posted long ago on your User page and recently deletedfor whatever private reasons.
Clearly I disagree with your FoF and decisions, and question your WP:COMPETENCE to serve on ARBCOM in light of the unjust actions you have take against me.

 Translating on Xhosa Wikipedia 

Hi . Molo. )

I'm writing to you because you were an active isiXhosa Wikipedian not too long ago and I hope you are able to volunteer there again.

Would you also please help translate the User interface and the User guide before VisualEditor is deployed next month. All you need to do is start an account at translatewiki.net. There's more information on the translating work at MediaWiki: Translation Central. 

Please try out VisualEditor before the rollout. To enable VisualEditor now, go to your """"Preferences"""", select """"Beta Features"""", and check the box to enable """"VisualEditor"""".

While I've declined speedy deletion, I see two major areas that require improvement in the article.
Notability: While there are some assertions of significance, such as winning Seedcamp 2008, it's not entirely clear how major that competition is. Accordingly, there's no clear demonstration that this is a notable web service. IMO, there's enough of an assertion that the article should not be deleted under speedy deletion criterion A7; however, it could easily be sent for deletion discussion.
Reliable sourcing: Other than basekit's website, the only source provided is a review at Download Squad. It appears to be on par with Engadget in terms of reliability. Still, to build a robust article (and demonstrate general notability), citations to other independent reliable sources should be made.
My personal recommendation is that this article be given some time to incubate, but if it's not improved over the next few weeks, it is subject to being nominated for deletion. —'''''' (talk)",0,0,0,0,0,0

I'ld like to retrieve one small item from the above hidden stuff. Martin's remark """"the answer is 2/3"""" and mine, """"no, the answer is switch"""". I did not mean to imply that the 2/3 should be made completely invisible. Of course one must emphasize that a good *reason* to switch is because the probability is 2/3 that you'll get the car this way. It is even a very very good reason to switch, since it is can be shown (if all doors are initially equally likely to hide the car) that you can't do better; in particular, complicated strategies of sometimes switching sometimes staying depending on specific door numbers lead to a smaller chance of success! (Morgan et al; Gill).

I hoped that this remark of mine would help show that by careful choice of words it's possible to write sentences which many more editors could agree with. And which everyone can agree are not misleading and which everyone can agree reflects what is in the literature.

Remember: Vos Savant and Whitaker ask what the player should do. Introducing probabilities into the story is one way of finding justification for an action. The phrase """"the probability"""" leads straight to controversy, at least to disagreement (both among editors and in the literature). The phrase """"what action should the player take"""" leads to concensus (both among editors and in the literature). 

It's just meant to be a small, practical concensus building suggestion!

Any line segment can be divided continuously ad infinitum.
At all times, with each division, the length of each part shortens by a half,
while at the same time, the number of parts multiplies by two.
So, how can an infinite number of parts
make up a finite whole? Because for every division, the lengths
of the parts are reducing as fast as the number of parts are increasing.   

There is not enough in sources for Zeno's writings to fully justify saying that Zeno ever actually claimed that the sum of an infinite number of numbers is infinite - though he has been interpreted that way by some. What is clear is that he thinks a task with an infinite number of steps cannot be completed.   01:03, 10 August 2012",0,0,0,0,0,0

On the """"about"""" page at the website of the Australian Haiku Society mention of Kacian is curiously absent, and we read simply, """"In December, 2000, Australian haiku enthusiasts banded together to form HaikuOz""""; regarding Slovenia, we read on the site of the German Haiku Society that """"The Haiku Club of Slovenia (HCS) was set up in September 1997"""" i.e. 3 years prior to Kacian's trip; in Serbia, there are two societies: the Aleksandar Nejgebauer Haiku Club was formed in 1993 according to their page on Templibres, and the Serbian Haiku Society was founded in 2004, according to this page on Tempslibres. According to this page on WHC, the Bulgarian Haiku Club was formed in 1999.

 Mind Pollution and Sin Star votes 

I have to take issue with your count in closing the vote on Mind Pollution. By my count there were, as you said, five votes for deletion — from myself (the nominator), BDAbramson, Mgm, KissL, and DV8 2XL — and only two votes to keep — one from Factitious, and four from sin-thetik, the article creator.

I also disagree with your count of votes for the related article, Sin Star. By my count there were five delete votes — the same five who voted to delete Mind Pollution — but you only counted four, one merge vote from Factitious, and three keep votes from sin-thetik, the article creator.

I would suggest that in the future when closing votes you check the history to determine the authorship of unsigned votes. I also think the quality and nature of the arguments presented are more important than the raw vote count. I would like to renominate these articles, but I'm not sure what the rules on that are. I guess I'll have to go read the deletion policy.

In the Sin Star article it says, """"Such promotional activities carried out by fans have gone as far as having MTV.com tricked into placing a Sin Star artist biography on their site however this was promptly removed the same day."""" It also says their debut album will come out next year, and that they don't have a label. It seems they have been more successful at defacing Wikipedia than they were at MTV.com.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Point of view terms used in the Scott article 

In the modern reaction it is said: 

""""Scott's reputation survived the period after World War II, beyond the 50th anniversary of his death.""""

This is rather obvious Point-of-view-terminology. Saying something has survived only until a certain point in time basically means it's dead. Captain Scott's reputation is far from dead, so this is not a true representation of reality.

A correct encyclopedic term would be:

""""Scott's high reputation remained uncontested until the period after World War II, beyond the 50th anniversary of his death.""""

Another problem is that it is spoken of a timeframe beyond World War II, but the first book that is mentioned offering criticism in the next sentence is from 1966. Here we have a difference of more than 20 years that are claimed to belong to the time that Scott's high reputation had been contested, while in reality they belong to the uncontested period.

For example the reference you put are biased on one openion and in one direction that is Anti Ahmadiyya websites. How can some one claim that the material which is published on Ahmaiyya site is edited..even if it is edited to suit something, we must accept it as an Official point of view of a community, we dont have to agree with it, but we have to accept it as Official point of view. So if you put some information from an Anti Ahmadiyya web site it will be biased as on the official web site you dont find this information, the best informaiton will be if we can match this information on both sides, other wise, regardless true or false, it will remain Biased and that is against the Policy of Wikipedia. That is why i have suggested earlier that there is no restriction on puting information on open plate form like Wikipedia, but instead of puting on this artical there are other artical where this information can be put it. For example, there are Artical like Islam and Quran, but Critism on Islam is a totally different Artical, so the Islam Poisition is defined in Islam Artical, but Critism was defined in other Artical. If a Bio Artical like Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is a Bio Artical, the Critism or his so called failed Prophecies, will not suit for this Artical. You can even creat a new Artical more suitable to the title and information against him or his Community.

 More To Benjiboi 

You wrote on the Sanchez article discussion thread:

 For those looking for the information, Sanchez apparently used to place ads as """"Excellent Top"""" and he a related website http://excellent-top.com/, the access which has since been blocked by the site owner. This is likely the same ad referenced in the Colmes interview and comparing information from the porn site before it was removed unearthed some pretty compelling information but I'm not sure if it warrants much research but it matches information to a Matt Ayala Sanchez with the same birthdate. So might be worth including if reliable sources confirm.

This is incorrect. Sanchez ran Excellent-Top from 1999 to 2002. Then he went into business as """"No Regrets Massage"""" in New York. The phone number from the """"No Regrets Massage"""" ads, which ran in the New York Blade for most of 2004, is where Alan Colmes contacted Sanchez. My partner reached him at the same number. All of this is detailed on my partner's website, which was termed a """"hate site"""" by Elonka and the other senior Wikipedia administrators and editors because it called Sanchez a fool.

My partner thinks Sanchez is a fool, and said so. I agree with my partner, and more. Having an opinion about a set of facts does not invalidate the facts. There is no need for you to reinvent the wheel. All the facts are at that website. Sanchez knows it, and so do the powers-that-be at Wikipedia. They are determined to keep those facts out of the article and drive away anyone who brings them to light, no matter what Wikipedia's rules might say to the contrary.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Freedom House comment in introduction 

I deleted a paragraph in the opening of the article; this was promptly re-inserted by another user.  The text is: """"Israel is a democratic republic with universal suffrage that operates under the parliamentary system. According to the international data reported by Freedom House, the degree of political rights and civil liberties in Israel makes it the only liberal democracy in the Middle East, consisting of a multi-party system and separation of powers"""" 

I believe I had good reasons for removing it:

(1) The very same text - verbatim - is repeated later in the article.  This is reason enough for deleting it from the opening.  Without citing chapter and verse of Wikipedia policies, obviously a well-written article cannot be repetitious.

(2) A conclusionary statement about civil liberties is ipso facto a value-judgment.    This is obviously going to be endlessly controversial whatever the country involved (see point (3) below).  It is churlish to place this kind of comment right up there in the introduction.  Common/significant views about political rights are much better dealt with (less tersely) under the Government heading. I myself do not seek to contest the view that Israel has a high degree of political freedom, so if you disagree with me, deal with the point I make about the reasonableness of reporting this sort of evaluation in the opening of *any* country article.

(3) Where the very same text appears in the Government section, it is immediately followed by a contrary viewpoint, which the author(s) of this section thought was equally significant: """"Conversely, the research group Minorities at Risk (MAR) characterizes Israel's system ...""""  This gives a nice indication of how controversial the Freedom House opinion is, or at least appears to be to other Wikipedians.  Indeed, I'd like to ask: does the person who reverted my deletion of the same text from the opening think that its stupid to allign the Freedom House statement with opposing viewpoints (maybe because the Freedom House statement is 'incontrovertible', or whatever), and if so why did he/she not remove the 'Minorities at Risk' comment from the Government section?

(4) The text is a quote from Freedom House, which is widely regarded as a US-lead, organisation operating to promote a particular policy programme.  The Times (hardly a fringe opinion) has described it as an """"outpost of American soft power"""": .  Unlike, say, the Human Development Index there is hardly any global consensus support for its reports.  Giving its views such decisive prominence - treating them as the bottom-line on the country's political status by placing them in the opening - seems unencyclopaedic.  

I suggest that unless consensus forms against me on this, I should remove the offending text from the introduction.  There's presumably no objection to the same text being under the Government section (as it currently is - as well).

 As I said above, Deep learning is the name of a class of algorithms. Feedforward neural nets, restricted Boltzmann machines, deep neural networks and deep belief networks are all mathematical models. How the models are trained, that is, how model parameters are chosen to optimize some loss function, is another topic entirely. People had looked at deep neural network architectures before deep learning techniques were developed, but it was the deep learning techniquesunsupervised pre-training, layer by layerthat made deep networks more practical at the time. With today's GPU based algorithms, the need for pre-training has lessened. The hype surrounding deep learning has muddied the concept to point that people like Michael Jordan claim it is just a synonym for neural network. But the backlash from current hype doesn't change the historical importance of deep learning algorithms in generating interest and good results in deep neural network models or representational learning. Schmidhuber's review has a good discussion of these issues.   21:55",0,0,0,0,0,0

The Kansas City MSA is NOT a part of the state of Kansas. While some suburbs do spill into the state of Kansas, Kansas Citians pride themselves as being culturally independent from the state of Kansas. 60 percent of the MSA is located in Missouri, the airport is in MO, the tall buildings (downtown) is in MO, the sports stadiums are in MO and overall the entire metro is anchored in Missouri. It is the second largest MSA in Missouri, and is not part of kansas really at all. This needs to be deleted.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 70.246.231.23   

^^ The above comment was made by me. I forgot to log in. Kansas City is ANCHORED IN MISSOURI. Actually, Wichita has a larger MSA in the state of Kansas than Kansas City would even if you counted the numbers. JoCo adds about 500 thousand and the dotte is about 100 thousand. According to the article on Wichita, there are 680,000 in their metro.

The first two sources for the """"Legacy"""" section are explaining the situation where Jack Welch in 2012 tweeted an implication that the Labor Department could be fixing job numbers. He had a lot of criticism and also attention from the Obama campaign, but told WSJ that he should have used a question mark in the original tweet because he wanted to raise a question about the legitimacy of the job numbers. He states in his own words that the debate has led to people looking at unemployment data more carefully and skeptically. Quote: “The coming election is too important to be decided on a number. Especially when that number seems so wrong.” 

The NYT source talks about the future of GE as it “gets past the Jack Welch Era” and the fate of GE Capital enterprise as a spin-off many years after Welch has left.

The current article mentions very little about the Jack Welch Management Institute, but the WiredAcademic article provides a direct interview with Jack Welch where he discusses the school and his view on digital learning. The article provides a lot of details about the Institue as well as his opinions.

As a cook I often need to find recipes and their closely related variations in the same way a lawyer or doctor may need to find cases and their variations. 

In the past I resolved this need by asking the computer questions by means of submitting keywords. Today the method I use is quite different.

Today I find recipes and their variations by query - not by my query of the computer but by the computer's query of me. 

What makes this better is the time I save repeating keyword submissions  to refine responses and find the answer I need.

What makes this possible is the computers ability to minimize the number of questions it must ask.

Am I correct that the crux of the case against Stevens was that he got some work done to his house for a reduced cost as part of some kind of kick-back?

What exactly were the 7 charges against him?

 Editing of Anthony Hungerford 

Dear Phillip,

               My comments regarding your editing of this site are not hostility, they are upset!
I have only ever place three entries onto Wikipadia, and am the first to acknowledge that I have not made myself fully aware to the protocols of the site. After some 30 years of researching my ancestry, my primary aim was to share the information garnered on those few individuals who have been somewhat prominent in history.

My upset comes from the fact that the editing was not sympathetic. You seem to have just wiped the article and started again. 
The upshot was that instead of leaving the information on the page [after all it has been there for some time-what is the rush to change it?] and asking for clarification, certain aspects just disappeared.

If I understand it correctly, it seems that Wikipedia prefers to quote as a source from the Calendars of State Papers – because a contributor to DNB or ODNB [a secondary source] has seen it, and delete my other quote from the Calendar of State Papers with source reference-because I have seen it personally in a printed book of the Calendars?

Likewise, as I mentioned to you in my email, it was obvious that the authors of both the old DNB and the ODNB did not actually know the origins of Colonel Hungerford-they both speculated. Whereas my later research had got nearer to the truth with my finding details given by Colonel Hungerford to the Ulster Herald, when he arrived in Ireland with his Regiment –which you confirmed with the full reference –

•TABDublin: National Library of Ireland, Genealogical Office: Ms.45, pp.59-60: """"Certificate of Arms to Col. Anthony Hungerford of Marson in Wiltshire and his pedigree. He arrived with his Regiment in D]ublin, April 30, 1647.""""
•TABDublin: National Library of Ireland, Genealogical Office: Ms.45, p.62 Certificate of Arms and cadency to Ensign St. John Hungerford, third brother of and ensign to Col. Anthony Hungerford, May 12, 1647.

I apologise if I have been too harsh in my comments to you, but you must understand that it was basic sourced information, which at the time was not on the internet, that I was seeking to share with Wikipedia readers, not style, rules and display.
I hope you have not finished with your editing. If you require any further clarifications please contact me.

The exiled map!

This map is alive only on my personal pages (since I created it) as an exile because of a dispute with 2 bias posters. There attitude was poor and they ultimately both disproved there nonsense and made me leave the U.K. railways in distress. Flaimers? 

The false 'allegations' were-

No time frame- It was on the map's title.

Bias because more accidents coming from English speaking states to the English Wikipedia- If that is of concern, then the Wikipedia article I used as a source is also guilty.

Bias because America has a big and busy railway- India has a world rebound railway, witch is both an example of big and busy! As for the non-stop life of the Japanese, German and British railways!

Noting the un-note-worthy- I literally copied the Wikipedia article in to a map, so that also goes back to say, that if anything, the article needs a good tidy up.

Name your sources- The Wikipedia article it was attached to.

To may variables to decipher- Were they indirectly questioning the whole article’s itegraty, since the map was only a literal coppy of the on-screen text.

Portrayed America in a poor light- If that's so, what about India, they were running a close second for 'Most rail crashes between 1950 and 2006. """"Whats good for the goose is good for the gander"""" as we say in the U.K.

The flamers never noticed-

They did not notice that I have missed of Eritrea's new railway or that Libya dose not have a railway, and said nothing when I corrected the map.

Hi Veliath, you are right the page Nasrani should be redirected to the page Syrian malabar nasrani, or to the page Syriac Christianity.

it was originally redirected to Syriac Christianity but several vandals tampered with the pages on syrian malabar nasrani and st thomas christians. In fact there was an entire section on st thomas christians explaining its nasrani context which was systematically destroyed by vandals. Instead they wrote in factually inaccurate statements about the st thomas christians being marathas and telegu which is still there on the page Saint Thomas Christians.

here I post to you the passages destroyed by the vandals:

>>>>>

This article deals with the Saint Thomas Christian churches and denominations of the Nasrani people

The Saint Thomas Christians (Malayalam: Nasrani) are a group of Christians from the Malabar coast (now Kerala) in South India, who follow Syriac Christianity. The different groups and denominations within the St Thomas Christians together form the Nasrani people. Their tradition goes back to the very beginnings of first century Christian thought, and the seven churches that are believed to have been established by St. Thomas the Apostle.

Nasrani and Saint Thomas Christian tradition

The Nasranis are an ethnic people and in that sense a single community. However the Nasranis have various denominations as a result of Portuguese persecution. As an ethnic community they refer to themselves as Nasranis referring to the common cultural heritage and cultural tradition. However as a religious group they refer to themselves as the Mar Thoma Khristianis or in English as Saint Thomas Christians referring to the various and diverse religious denominations between them in terms of their religious tradition, despite a common ancestory of being the descendants of the early Mar Thoma church or Saint Thomas tradition of Christianity.

These first century churches, according to tradition, were, from north to south: Palayoor near Guruvayoor/Kunnankulam, Cranganore (believed to be the ancient Muziris of Pliny, and the Periplus, on the north bank of Periyar River today), Paravoor on the south side of Periyar, Gokkamangalam or Kokkamangalam, Niranam, Chayal or Nilakkal (the only inland church) and the Lakes or Kaayals, and finally Kollam. The visit of the Apostle Thomas to these places and to Mylapore on the East coast of India can be read in the Ramban Song of Thomas Ramban, set into modern writing c. 1500.

Good morning....

 Civility and stuff 

Regarding my last WP:FOOTY input, i have already replied you there. Here, i'll only add, other than a second apology to you, WP, WP:FOOTY and (some of) those concerned with some of the contents of my input: i can cope with being called """"stupid"""" (what's intelligence anyway), but VILE? Please think about what you wrote as well my friend.

Attentively -   
The events of the last week have been very disturbing and I was offended by what you said, so I can only imagine how someone who lost a loved one would've reacted to your comment. As I said before, think about what you write before you click that save button. Comparing a cheating footballer to a mass murder is wrong. talk 

I'll try to """"defend"""" myself once again, as i feel i did not manage it the last time around: i only chose that comparison to illustrate the level of vandalism occurring in the footballer's page (i did not compare anyone, i merely """"reasoned"""" - or did not! - if this occurs in a mere footballer page, what can be done with a real scumbag like that mass murderer and the ones like him), i only chose a very unfortunate example to guide me by. I guess you are very upset at me, and there's nothing i can say at this moment to """"turn back the tide"""", so i'll just be quiet for now...

No friends in real life, still have time to make enemies in the virtual world, even though i intend just the opposite -   
You don't have to apologise to me, I'm not going to hold it against you. It was an off the cuff remark and we all make them. If you look at the editing history of Sam Deering you will see an expansion I made after answering a request to do so. I found something unsavoury that he said during his time at Oxford United and in my edit summary I made a comment about his intellect, which I shouldn't have. You do a lot of great work around here and I have no beef with you, so don't worry about it. talk

That helped a lot, thanks. The thing is most of the media sources in India(often considered the criteria for WP:RS) neither present an event in its complete terms nor is there a neutral perspective ever if any. A lot of issues and persons have been badly attacked by almost every section of the mainstream media, and it is so extremely rare to hit upon a site that gives some fair perspective or the other side of the coin but then they are not generally regarded in front of what the usual sources like The Hindu or the TOI which omits to cover certain parts of India and most of what is published is highly opinionated. The other day, content based on a fairly reasonable source was removed and this was hugely absurd since none of other mainstream media even covered the 2011 Tamil Nadu elections at a length, except for announcing the winning coalition.  Nothing much(in fact nothing at all) is mentioned of this person and his campaigning that brought about the fall of the ruling alliance. At the moment, various Youtube channels and small-scale news agencies(that probably don't even own a website of their own) are the only bearers of pieces of information and its bloody unbelievable that I'am the first wikipedian trying to get all these into Wikipedia. Excluding this personality, There are several others more who are making significant popular impact, but are nowhere to be found in Wikipedia. Its more pitiful that the already experienced and active Indian Wikipedians are not giving a damn either. It only brings editors like me to the suspicion that the existing chaps are perhaps too opinionated and biased to ignore true and essential information coming out, and worse still they are the first to sponsor/support opposition towards others who try to step in for the sake by bringing WP:RS every time. Thousands of other articles meanwhile, present heck loads of falsehood and bulls*it. I'am not using that as an excuse, but you know, its just surprising(and suspicious) the extent of controversy that is inflicted on a select few articles. As a relative newbie, I find Its tough to resist intimidation and not crumble at the same time. Thanks for your reply, it was very informative, and I'am glad I was worth all that.

Lets Get something straight here; I will tell you who was really a commander on the Iranian Side. 

Ayatollah Khomeini- The Supreme leader controls the Army and the Pasdaran, so Khomeini is without a doubt a commander.

Ayatollah Khamenei- The president maintains some control over the army and while he reports to the Supreme Leader, he still welds significant control over their day to day operations, therefore Khamenei is Also a Commander

Mostafa Chamran- he was the Minister of Defense and a General under the Early stages of the war. He was killed in Action late in 1981. So he would have been sincerely a comander.

Ali Sayad Shirazi- Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces during the War, no question about his classification as a Commander.

Mohsen Rezaee- Commander of the Pasdaran, Heavily involved in the fighting, again, no question.

Now here are people who should not be classified as commander. 

Abdolhassan Banisadr- President but He was impeached in the first days of the war, so he never commandered anything during the War.

Mohammad Ali Rajai- President only for less than three weeks after Banisadr, so he never commandered anything. 

Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani- Throught his career as a cleric during the War, Rafsanjani never went into affairs regarding the military (exception being the Iran-Contra Affair) and simply worked with business within the country.

Mir Hossein Mousavi- The Prime Minister did not wield any power over the military, he simply worked exclusively on affairs within the country.

So please don't change the commanders list, this is all the proof you need.",0,0,0,0,0,0

This is the first article I nominate to GA-review, please tell me if I miss anything. walk victor falk talk 

What about those taken prisoner by the British/Allies in the Middle East. Also those who refused to join the Free French in Britain and were repatriated back to France.?   
I respect this point, but we're talking about close on two million people in prisoner of war camps in Germany. That's what the scholarship covers and it's that which is covered by reliable sources establishing notability. Everything else, a tiny fraction by comparison, is generally only mentioned as a footnote to a general history of the campaign. Yes, French soldiers were probably taken prisoner from Indochina to Britain, North Africa to the Middle East. But they pale into insignificance when compared with the 2 million in Germany and this is why all the titles on the bibliography talk about French prisoners but only deal with the German-held ones. So I see your point, but I can't really do anything about it. It just isn't out there. '  
  Yesterday I was editing Free_France#Syria_and_East_Africa, and as it mentioned how only 5000 out of 40000 chose to join Free France while the rest wanted to be rapatriated, my immediate spontaneous/instinctive reaction was to wish for something like [[French WWII POWs#Vichy prisoners]] to target in this article. However, as  notes, some probably existed but their numbers are vanishlingly small and the result of special circumstances, such as beeing spies, obvious traitors & collaborators and suchlike that does not fall in what is considered a POW by international conventions; For the allies, rank and file Vichy troops were always offered a choice of repatriation, no questions asked, and their incarceration as POWs always a temporary affair.  I can think that more conventional perhaps such existed as Axis and especially Japanese ones after the coup in March 1945 eliminated any fiction of Vichy rule in Indochina, but sources about that might be very elusive to find; and anyway, probably more within the scope of the """"POWs held by the Japanese"""" wikipedia article. At the most, a short sentence summarising the above might be added somewhere, to dispell the same curiosity from readers that you've shown. walk victor falk talk

A. No; it ought to be taken in the exact sense of our Saviour's  teachingthat is, not repaying evil for evil. We ought to  oppose evil by every righteous means in our power, but not by  evil.

To follow up, I am very sympathetic indeed to your project to add the names of distinguished biologists and biological educators. If you'll check what I do around here, you'll see it is mainly to improve and defend the articles of scientists and other academics and related subjects.  But there are some difficulties. I can best exemplify the difficulty by saying that the article on John Tyler Bonner was nominated about 6 months ago for speedy deletion as """"did not assert notability"""" and fortunately rescued. About one member of the US National academy of sciences gets nominated for deletion at AfD a month. They all get kept, but it takes work. 

What is needed for a successful article on a researcher is:
A short bio listing the birth, degrees, positions. 
A paragraph describing the work and how it has been recognized as important
A list of books, & a few major articles. When challenged, I add the number of citations for the most-cited. 
A list of awards and honors and editorships . 
I've been adding grants received. 
if possible a ref from a biographic noticethis gets much easier  after they have died. 
and of course none of it can be taken from a university or other web site, tho the site should be listed as supplying the details. 
Pictures, as you've discovered, add problems. I usually dont try. 
This works if: the person was a full professor at a recognized research university, and has an award or  two from outside the university. Otherwise there are problems; people at non-research places need very solid documentation. Professors of education need really solid documentation. 
 
For educators not noted as researchersawards are needed for professional recognition, and at least one more than the president of NABT will in general be necessary. We have so far not had very good success herevery few high school teachers have made it past AfD. Good luck, and call on me for any help. ''''''  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The thing is that Saying that the Vedas permit beef-eating and cow-slaughter amounts to striking a lethal blow to a Hindu’s soul. Respect for bovine or livestock animals is a core tenet of Hinduism. But, Once you are able to convince a hindu of flaws in the foundation of this core tenet and make him feel stupid/guilty, '''he becomes an easy prey for the predator faiths. There are millions of ill-informed Hindus who are not empowered to counter argue and hence quietly surrender (and convert).Vegetarianism is an integral part of most schools of Hinduism. The Vedas are also accused of animal sacrifice in sacrificial ceremonies popularly known as the YAJNA. Interestingly a section of home-bred intellectuals claiming to have deep study of ancient India has also come up, who cite references from works of western indologists to vindicate such untrue accusation against the Vedas.The Vedas have not condoned the practice of killing animals anywhere,. But, due to the rise of dilettantism fused with a plethora of societal changes, influence of external cultures and severe lack of awareness about real Vedic injunctions, the role of religion has withered over the years.

But alas, thanks to all the slanderous and conjectural accusations heaped upon the Vedas that can be attributed mainly to the interpretations of commentaries written by Mahidhar, Uvat and Saayan in the medieval times; and to what Vam-margis or the Tantra cult propagated in their books in the name of the Vedas, animal Sacrifice is rashly associated with Hinduism (as if the religion itself promotes violence against animals).

In the more recent times, Swami Dayanand Saraswati – known as the grandfather of modern India – interpreted the Vedas as per the correct grammars of the language and authentic evidences. His literature, which includes commentary on the Vedas, Satyarth Prakash (loosely translated as """"Light of Truth""""), An Introduction to the Vedas and other texts led to widespread social reformation based on Vedic philosophy and dispelling of myths surrounding the Vedas.Some verses of Vedas prohibiting killing animals:Some verses from other Hindu scriptures prohibiting Killing animals:'''

 Jesus article too long 

Recently, I was trying to add quotes of Jesus to the article but I got a revert with this response:  """"this article is long enough - refer reader to wikisource or other articles"""" Doc glasgow

The problem with this is that many if not all wiki articles on people have quotes of them, and many of them have """"quotes"""" sections.

If the article is too long and you want me to refer to other articles to shorten it up, then I propose we do just that and take some sections away and add a """"Other topics about Jesus"""" towards the bottom that adds the main articles of items we got rid of.

I propose that we condense these topics:

1. Chronology (which is under life and teachings, and we could include a reference to this article's main article in an introduction to the whole Life and Teachings section)
2. Background
3. Names and titles
4. Ethnicity and physical characteristics
5. Artistic and dramatic portrayals

And then, since some of this stuff has sources at the bottom, but is now gone, we can get rid of it.

Also, since most of the sections point to reference articles which discus the sub-topic in more detail, we can get rid of many of the other sources.

This should substantially reduce these sections:
1. Notes
2. Sources and further reading
3. See also
4. External links

After this the whole Jesus article will be much shorter.  Then perhaps we can focus on the stuff left over and make it really nice, and maybe Jesus can become a featured article.

 It's amazing the amount of ignorance concerning Martin Luther. Early in his life he was a stalwart defender of the Jews, saying

and 

""""Absurd theologians defend hatred for the Jews. ...

What people fail to put together is that Luther suffered a tremendous decline in health in his old age (Iversen OH (1996). """"[Martin Luther's somatic diseases. A short life-history 450 years after his death]"""" (in Norwegian). Tidsskr. Nor. Laegeforen. 116 (30): 3643–46.) and decayed into senility. It was in this state that he challenged the canonicity of the Book of James and even recanted his faith on his death-bed. He lost his mind in his old age. Medicine had simply failed to progress to the point where they could diagnose it at that point in history. His later comments should not be privileged any more than the average institutionalized individual. It's very sad that people who wish to defame Luther take such a narrow-minded view of his illness and comments in order to discredit him. Truly it was a tragedy that such a great man was so utterly destroyed by illness.

 US emissions description is totally contentless now. 

The US section is total nihil. It is nothing more than a circular self-referencing system of cryptic abbreviations, without absolutely any kind of numerical data to back it up! I guess you do not understand? Well, based on the wikipedia info a US """"partial zero emissions vehicle"""" could either be a bicycle (where the only emission is the cyclist's fart, to be rude) or a modified Hummer H1 SUV having an 1000 bhp Kenworth truck engine. There is no numerical info on the page to let us decide which is the case.

Any person could create a system of circularly self-referencing acronyms and abbreviations for emissions categories out of thin air. Yet, it would still be zero information content. So either delete the US emissions section or add the numerical data (how many grams of CO2, NOx, SOx, unburnt fuel, particle charcoal matter are emitted per distance travelled) to back up those cryptic PZEV and alike codes with verifieable information.

Look at the Euro-X standard descriptions. Each one is just a single sentence and it tells us the truth frankly. Weight and numbers, nothing else matters. Acronyms are PR bullshit and do not belong to an ecyclopaedia.

It is a shame US people do not dare to face the polluting nature of their monster cars and try to hide the sad """"20mpg"""" reality behind cryptic PZEV and similar abbreviations. In Europe 65mpg is reality now.

 Wow, I honestly don't know where to begin to respond to that ~ so lets start with your """"talking points."""" First off, I'm not trying to Americanize the article, somethings were changed (like donburi to rice bowl) but they are largely a manual of style issue than anything else. Next off, I'm not egotistical so showing off my editing skills is a non-issue, plus this is Wikipedia, someone else editing your work is a fact of life. Third, Deja Vu Artworks is based in Japan, if I worked for them that would seem that I lived in Japan as well, in which case, why would I want to Americanize the article?  Which brings us to trying to improve the article. As noted before, a good chuck of infomraiton in the original revisions was irrelevant - you do NOT need a song listing from a flash animation in an article that is a general overview of a subject. Also, the Deja Vu information was removed because it was unsourced and I can't seem to find any indication of resolution for the topic - it happened in 2004 and it is now 2007 either it was resolved or it fell by the way side, where as the Netrunner controversy is still on going and received a great deal of notice when it happened. If there is a bunch of information on Deja Vu that I am missing then by all means, point out some links and we can work it into the article. Now, in regards to most of the changes - this article toes very close to the fancruft category and as such most of the edits are there to try and pull it away from that category. In case you haven't noticed, most of the information in the List of OS-tans article is gone because that article was deleted; one of the reasons for which was fancruft. Now all that said, there is no reason why the descriptions of the top five 'tans can be expanded a bit, but you must remember that should not be a full bio of the characters, plus the fact that they can be changed at an artists whim means that you can't write in the matter of """"OSX-tan is always seen poking XP-tan"""" with a stick - that is just one thing that an artist can do.

I continue to disagree. Other articles demonstrate that it is entirely possible to have readable, easy-to-use tables with sufficient numbers of columns to display results for all the parties under discussion. They also show techniques to deal with parties sometimes being reported and sometimes not, and sometimes being reported together. There is no need for the opinion polling table to be so abbreviated. Thus, we should reflect what the citations say. If polls are released that lump everyone other than the four biggest parties as """"other"""", that's fine  we report """"other"""". If polls are released that give results for the Greens, BNP etc., then we should report those. We should be doing our best to avoid a situation where we are in danger of original research: I understand the 'cliff edge' argument, but that approach should be a last resort.

It's a big step from saying the volume number is incorrect to saying that the paper doesn't exist at all (& Stho002 professes that he has seen a copy, which would seem to argue for its existence). I'm also concerned that you're repeating the earlier error of original research, as I stated before. It is your opinion that the names are erroneous; you have not got that information from a reliable source. I know it seems ridiculous, but we simply can't impose our own opinions, particularly when we have so few sources to go on. We know the 2010 catalogue to be out of date, so we turn to WoRMS as the only up-to-date source available, and it's normally pretty reliable. The current text states """"the volume number and year of the article cited do not match"""", and cites this page (presumably intending this page), but neither page states that """"the volume number and year of the article cited do not match"""".

""""Chávez was raised a Roman Catholic, although he has had a series of disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic hierarchy and Protestant groups like the New Tribes Mission.

Dear Mr McLaughlin,

With regards to your persistent efforts of keeping the old spelling of the capital of Ukraine. For your information:

 It is spelled as Kyiv in English language because:
 1) Ukrainian government insists on Kyiv spelling
 2) The State Department of the U.S. issued a directive to write Kyiv
 3) The Prime Minister of the U.K. calls the city Kyiv - http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20199
 4) United Nations Multilingual Terminology Database (the ultimate body on geographical names) approved it as Kyiv - http://unterm.un.org/dgaacs/unterm.nsf/WebView/B57BF6AB5F06749B85256DC700440AAD?OpenDocument
 5) Major English speaking governments worldwide switched to Kyiv spelling
 6) CIA refers to the city as Kyiv - https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/up.html
 7) The name of the famous football club is Dynamo Kyiv (recognised worldwide)
 8) Many papers, e.g., British The Guardian, are already writing Kyiv
 9) All major Canadian media already use the spelling of Kyiv
 10) and many more reasons and references on http://kyiv.of-cour.se/

If we only listen to your arguments, we would be also correcting Almaty to Alma-Ata. However, it is Almaty and Kyiv it is of course. Above you have had enough of proofs and strong arguments of usage of the name Kyiv in the modern English language, so it is time to catch up and finally fix the name to Kyiv.

Morgellons disease: Analysis of a population with clinically confirmed microscopic subcutaneous fibers of unknown etiology
Virginia R Savely and Raphael B Stricker

Additional article information

Abstract
Background:
Morgellons disease is a controversial illness in which patients complain of stinging, burning, and biting sensations under the skin. Unusual subcutaneous fibers are the unique objective finding. The etiology of Morgellons disease is unknown, and diagnostic criteria have yet to be established. Our goal was to identify prevalent symptoms in patients with clinically confirmed subcutaneous fibers in order to develop a case definition for Morgellons disease.

Methods:
Patients with subcutaneous fibers observed on physical examination (designated as the fiber group) were evaluated using a data extraction tool that measured clinical and demographic characteristics. The prevalence of symptoms common to the fiber group was then compared with the prevalence of these symptoms in patients with Lyme disease and no complaints of skin fibers.

Results:
The fiber group consisted of 122 patients. Significant findings in this group were an association with tick-borne diseases and hypothyroidism, high numbers from two states (Texas and California), high prevalence in middle-aged Caucasian women, and an increased prevalence of smoking and substance abuse. Although depression was noted in 29% of the fiber patients, pre-existing delusional disease was not reported. After adjusting for nonspecific symptoms, the most common symptoms reported in the fiber group were: crawling sensations under the skin; spontaneously appearing, slow-healing lesions; hyperpigmented scars when lesions heal; intense pruritus; seed-like objects, black specks, or “fuzz balls” in lesions or on intact skin; fine, thread-like fibers of varying colors in lesions and intact skin; lesions containing thick, tough, translucent fibers that are highly resistant to extraction; and a sensation of something trying to penetrate the skin from the inside out.

Conclusions:
This study of the largest clinical cohort reported to date provides the basis for an accurate and clinically useful case definition for Morgellons disease.

Keywords: Morgellons, subcutaneous fibers, pruritus, delusions of parasitosis, Lyme disease, skin lesions
Introduction
Morgellons disease is a poorly understood multisystem illness characterized by stinging, biting, and crawling sensations under the skin.1 According to the Morgellons Research Foundation (MRF) website, more than 14,000 families are reportedly affected by this emerging disease.2 Considerable suffering occurs as thread-like fibers work their way out of the victim’s skin causing pain, itching, and open, disfiguring lesions (Figures 1 and ​and2).2). Unfortunately, patients are often dismissed as delusional by clinicians who are unfamiliar with the signs and symptoms of Morgellons disease.3–5 There is a scarcity of literature on Morgellons disease due to its relatively recent description in the modern medical literature, the reluctance on the part of the medical community to recognize it as anything other than psychopathology, and the lack of knowledge about its etiology and transmission.6

The distinctive feature of Morgellons disease is the presence of microscopic subcutaneous fibers1 (Figures 3, ​,4,4, and ​and5).5). Observation of the skin with a lighted, hand-held, 30 × to 60 × magnifier enables visualization of these red, blue, black, and white fibers that have the appearance of either straight hollow tubes or wiry tangled threads.1 At times the fibers are seen above the dermis as loosely clumped “fuzz balls” or as black specks the size of coffee grains. Examination of the black specks by electron microscopy reveals that they consist of a tightly woven ball of black fibers.6

I don't know whether the Opus Dei adheres to the index or, as it is said, censures new books, but I may say that if, it wouldn't be to blame for it. It has every right over its membership and followers, until forbidden so by the Holy See, that the Holy See itself over all the Church had when it did publish the index.
Though this has been officially denied, I believe the action of H. Em. Bertone against the Da Vinci Code was not far from censuring, and a quite just censuring too according to what one hears about its content (I actually didn't read it, Michael Crichton is better).
That Nietzsche was not included (I'm not sure about Schopenhauer) has I believe the easy reason that there was no need of clarification that his works are non-Catholic, and so """"on the index"""" by general rule without any need of explicity. Of course theoretically, those books Kant wrote on religion (and that includes the Critic of pure r.) would be implicitly on the index as well because he was not a Catholic, but from the very fact that he did believe in God, the Congregation may have felt the status of his books, from the Catholic point of view, needed further clarification. Also, not every work of Kant was listed.
As to its importance as of now, I agree (as a layman and non-theologian) that reading some of the books today not only does not lead to ecclesiastic penalties (as should be sure) but also is not sinful in itself, as no longer any disobedience to Church law (likewise, of course, as to Card. Bertone's semi-censuring) but it may be dangerous and thus imprudent, which can be not free from sin. (?) 84.154.109.57

In essence, you can create all the matter you want, as long as it has gravitational pull which he regards as a negative energy. If this is the case, then there could, in fact, be negative mass with positive gravitational energy, which behaves in an opposite manner. I would presume that annihilation due to matter-antimatter interactions would have gravitational energy considerations as well - but in any case, the mere fact that negative mass would accelerate in a different direction in a gravitational field does not in itself preclude its existence, especially since gravitational laws were formulated without accounting for this eventuality.",0,0,0,0,0,0

The name of a publisher does not seem sufficient, as to it being a good source. This was removed previously by the team member and author here . There are many notable sources for information on organic gardening... that can be clicked on and looked at as to information for a reff/note. Monetizing the article with the main contributing editors book does not seem like a good idea... especially since the information that it is his book was kept secret... or at least not openly discussed on the talk page until that information was discovered. Mr. Cross has said freely that he mailed copies of his book to his editing team here on this article. The book in question has a purchase price of around $60.00 USD. - Being rewarded with a high value link to a for profit book does not seem reasonable for editing an article on Wikipedia. I would be happy to find a mainstream... well known and free connector to replace Roger Spencer's book. Cross, R. & Spencer, R., 113-127.

This was the previous statement by Roger Spencer and I think we should stick with not using his book as a ref/note in the article. 

I have decided to delete the two references to the book: that way some of the current steam might blow away. There are a number of reasons. Firstly, I see that they are not as necessary as I once thought. When I inserted them I was not aware of another reference that would do the job I wanted. That no longer seems the case. As has been openly discussed,copies of the book were sent to editors of the article, Skip included, because I enjoyed the cameraderie of collaborative editing - even when there was the occasional tiff. The books were sent out in that spirit. There is another interpretation - that I was in effect """"buying"""" support ... mild bribery. This was not the intention - but then, you only have my word for that. I do not receive any royalties from the book - but then, you only have my word for that too. I do not believe any conventions or rules, Wikipedia or otherwise, have been breached in any way. etc, more text, etc. In short, I am removing the references for everyone's peace, and to expedite the completion of the article for assessment ... not as an acknowledgement of any kind of malpractice. end partial quote, Granitethighs 04:16, 29 April 2009 .

A matter that is both verifiable and supported by reliable sources might nonetheless be proposed to make a point or cited selectively; painted by words more favorably or negatively than is appropriate; made to look more important or more dubious than a neutral view would present; marginalized or given undue standing; described in slanted terms which favor or weaken it; or subject to other factors suggestive of bias.
Verifiability is only one content criterion. Neutral point of view is a core policy of Wikipedia, mandatory, non-negotiable, and to be followed in all articles. Concerns related to undue weight, non-neutral fact selection and wording, and advancing a personal view, are not addressed even slightly by asserting that the matter is verifiable and cited.

Certainly hundreds of thousands, and perhaps more that a million, German POWs died in Allied custody if the Soviet Union is included among the Allies. As well, tens of thousands of German civilians died in Soviet forced-labour crews.
Bacque does make a contribution, albeit flawed, to the historiography, one that has been built upon recently by Anthony Beevor and others, who have looked at the immediate post-war period, the state of Europe before the Marshall Plan, the European reconstruction period, the founding of the ECSC and the beginning of the Cold War.
I am not familiar enough with Bacque's books, especially the second one, to accurately describe them. I think someone who has read them carefully should, at least, give a bare outline of his argument before rejecting them out of hand.
I don't know why Holocaust deniers would embrace Bacque's work, since any neglect of Germans held as POWs by the Western allies does not negate the genocide against the Jews and other Nazi victims.
As for the plagiarisms committed by Ambrose: they are not relevant to this discussion.",0,0,0,0,0,0

this is stupid. i defent the actions of User:Cerejota in Talk:Digg and then User:Krimpet threatens to ban me. i then post in Talk:Digg that the cost of defending User:Cerejota is banning and then User:Leki and User:Android Mouse threaten to ban me, too. User:Android Mouse also reverts my changes. so i harass them back. was there a more proper warning i should have made against User:Leki? probably, but i don't know what it is.

but then  in general"""". WP:AGF!!! i don't see how i was ever uncivil. the one example User:Krimpet provides is bogus. that was intended as a joke and if you can't take it as a joke, that's your problem. it certainly isn't worthy of a ban.

i'd post this on your talk page, User:Krimpet, but because of the ban, i can only post on mine. so i hope you read my talk page and apologize. apologize and make User:Leki and User:Android Mouse do the same. either that or you should step down because you are clearly a disgrace to wikipedia.

oh, sry. my saying you're a disgrace to wikipedia violates WP:CIVIL, doesn't it? maybe you should have thought of that before you violated WP:CIVIL, yourself, and threatened to ban me. and perhaps User:Leki and User:Android Mouse should have thought of that, too. you can't expect civility when the people you're engaging in friendly debate with try to subvert your arguments by banning you or deleting them, all together. that i've been civil up to know is pretty amazing and i should be commended for it - not banned for it.""",1,0,0,0,0,0

Picture this: Wikipedia user_A in China posts material that does not support the current government. User_B is also in China and privately messages user_A that they will report them to the authorities. (as they are required by law to do). Wikipedia would obviously not allow user_B to continue to help suppress the freedom of speech of User_A, especially since the Law of China has no authority over Wikipedia, and neither does the law of the US armed forces.
You, Orangemarlin are overstepping your duty, you cling to your past authority like a baby clings to their blanket. You have no business threatening anyone for their actions on wikipedia. Your intent is purely to feel some sort of power over another person, because if you were doing it out of duty you would have gone through with it without informing the second party of your actions.

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,1,0,1,0,0,0

 Veritas (that's latin for truth boys and girls) 

Before the next one of you redneck fuckwits 'corrects' my inclusion of fair and informative photographs (most of which were taken by members of the US Military, all of which have endlessly appeared in international news media, and none of which anyone is claiming to be fake - correct me if i'm wrong on this-), answer me the following:

If the wings sheared off on impact, where are they in the photographs? 
(and if anybody starts talking about airliner 'vaporisation' on here, then wikipedia is already worthless and I am wasting my time. its like a film trailer: """"From the people who brought you the magic bullet and WMDs, comes a story beyond all rationality."""")

If the plane hit the ground before impact, why is the lawn unmarked?

A 757 impact is either:
(a) strong enough to bring down a steel reinforced world trade centre
or:
(b) not even strong enough to create more than a 9 metre hole in three concrete sections of the pentagon.
 (i'll give you a clue, both these things cannot be true)

I haven't been around the page much lately (sick of haggling over trivialities), but the last time I checked the lead was largely the one written my Mathsci (which I had tweaked a bit after the mediation was over).  As for my redactions, they were surgical, (carefully removing personal comments without affecting the meaning of the sentence), and mostly affected TechnoFaye (whose mouth consistently runneth over).  I redacted Mathsci's comments 3 or 4 times, as well as comments from several others - it had no impact on the discussion except to remove inflammatory wording.

Occam, Arthur is trying to insinuate that I'm guilty of some sort of malfeasance without actually coming straight out and accusing me of malfeasance, because has no evidence (or even a decent reason to believe) that I've done something wrong.  Plus, he thinks we're all too stupid to recognize that he's being uncivil when he does it indirectly like this.  If he wants to make an explicit argument against me out of this mess of hand-waving, let him.  As soon as he does, I'll take him to ANI and request he be blocked for gross incivility.  If he just wants to keep insinuating then he's got a toothless argument that you can safely poo-poo in proper Victorian style.  Ludwigs2 """,1,0,0,0,0,0

 Dear soldier of the Wikipedia neo-nazi/communist dictatorship 
What the hell are you tlaking about. I did not re-creat any article about the formal Australian Worker's Party formaly known as the New Communist Party of Australia. I think you are high on the lies told by storm front. You the hell listens to storm front. Oh my god Wikipedia is becomeing a dumping ground for neo-nazis and altra lefties. Since I am the voice of reason. I just have to say one thing. Pleas read my reply to storm front. Here it is - Okay okay. Lats just get the fatcs right. This is what some nazi said on storm front
"""" Peter Watson (of Warwick, Qld.) has claimed to represent all sorts of groups, and - in forums - likes to pretend he is several people at the same time. He has a habit of claiming to be the President of organisations he has made up on the internet. He says he is 14 (or 16) years old.""""

Answere:- No I have not supported lotsd of groups. I have only supported the CPW , AWP (formally known as the NCPA). I was never a member of the People's Think Tank Association plus the PTTA never had a president. Plus I have only ever been one person. And that person is Peter Watson. This nazi must have a lot of time on his hands to look for information on me. So I can only come up with only one conclusion and that is simply that this man has no social or sex life. So I can only say on thing """"go get a life man and get a women"""".

Peter was President of the """"People's Think Tank Association"""" based in Warwick, which he says """"split from the Communist Party of Australia just recently and they publish the Caller""""

Answere:- I was never the president of the PTTA. The PTTA was never ever created. The Caller was a fake news paper. As fare as I know it was only ever printed once by some nazi. Since the PTTA was never realy so how cna it split from the CPA. So many questions and not enough answeres. The man just doesn't have a life.

Peter was """"President of the New Communist Party of Australia"""" and """"Chairman of the Central Committee"""" (this is in his Communist International News)

Answere:- I was the president but not the had of the NCPA. I was the chairman of the central commitee. But as you might know the NCPA and the AWP are the same group. The AWP change its name to NCPA but change it's name back soon after remember you stupid nazi.

Peter was """"President of the Communist Party of Warwick""""

Answere:- Only for a short number of times in the hsitory fot he party that I was the presidnet of it.

Peter also says: """"the New Communist Party of Australia (NCPA) , The People Think Tank Association (PTTA) and the Communist Socialist Workers Front (CSWF) did dissolve and absorbed into the Australia First Party (AFP)"""".

Answere:- The Communist Socialist Worker's Front never ever was created and never was real. It just goes to show that nazis just makes things up to help them selvs. The PTTA was never real. If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun.

Peter has also set up the """"Australian Worker's Party""""

Answere:- This nazi (FairDinkum) is a idiot. I have said this many times that it was started in april was a split from the CPW that changed it's name to NCPA than change it's name back to AWP when it was kicked out fo the AFP. Not only are nazis stupid like FairDinkum but they also don't listen.

I am a Communist and believe in Marxist-Leninism. I am not retarted. Plus I am not troubled person or retarted. I have never said in my life that I was the king of the Communists or the Nazis. Once more the nazis made some thing up to make them selvs look better and sound better than other people.""",1,0,0,0,1,0

Let me give you people who love this guy/girl Deepak....An idea of what Deepak is like....He must be some really unhappy person......i promoise you this is what it is like in dealing with Deepak. 

I bring up an issue where im asking why an article does not have more info, or about editing an article, or about taking something out of an article. 

And Deepak wont allow me to make edits. 

So I give Deepak examples and information and trying to back up my edits are legit. 

And Deepak ignores my logic and doesnt give me alot of logic as to why my info is not valid then 

So I try to figure out why Deepak is being so strcit. I remind him that i backed up what i said. That i had information that was logical. And why my edits are good. 

And Deepak calls me a troll and insults me and accuses me of being a nazi lover or something

So I answer every insult, every accustation , and every put down that Deepak gives me. And then i remind him of why my edits are valid.

And Deepak ignores most of what i write and continues to call me a troll. Or a nazi lover. Or other insults. 

I then get annoyed and ask Deepak why is he ignoring most of my logic that i write down? Why does he pick and choose what he wants to answer? Why does he not give me logic in return? 

And Deepak wont reply . 

I then ask other users about making edits and asking them about my logic and giving them my reasons as to why my edits are valid. And some answer and some agree and some dont. 

And Deepak all of a sudden starts responding again....with logic? No....with answers? no....with reasoning? no....with information? no....he tells the other users that im a troll and a nazi and pro India then . 

I then answer all of Deepaks insults. I remind him of why i want edits to be made. I give him my information as to why  my edits are valid then. 

And Deepak goes back calling me a troll, and a nazi, and a pro India dude. 

And this kind of stuff goes on and on and on...you get the idea.....he ignores information you give him. He picks and chooses what he wants to answer. And he doesnt even answer the logic you give him sometimes. But he wastes his time in name calling, and insluts, and putting you down then. 

So then after a while i get annoyed. And i remind him how things got this bad between us. I type and type and type and type just like i am now. 

And Deepak ignores most of what i typed. 

Many times i write him these long replies where i answer all his points, where i tell him why its wrong for him to insult me and put me down, and why its wrong for him to ignore the information i have as to why i want to make an edit, or whatever it is im bringing up then.....and no matter how much i write....even if i write these long replies to him then....even if i answer every point he brings up....he usually either ignores most of what i wrote down....or....he picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....or.....he just responds back by calling me a troll, or accusing me of being pro nazi or something, or accusing me of ignoring his points (which is so not true cus i respond to pretty much everything he says then), or accusing me of not understanding what he is telling me, or just accusing me of being pro India then (which I am) or just insulting me, or just name calling me, or just putting me down. 

So then after a while i get so annoyed cus he's this a guy here then with me now, and so i start to call him names. I call him a dictator. I call him the ruler of wikiepdia. And I tell him how he ignores my points. 

And then Deepak tells me how i cant call him names, and how i cant throw mud at him, and how im breaking wikipedia rules

So then I ask him how comes its ok for him to name call me and i cant? How come its ok for him to throw mud at me but I cant then? How come its ok for him to break Wikipedia's rules but I can't then? 

And Deepak has no logical answer....or....he won't respond to those questions that I ask him then . Or he just ignores what i ask him, and goes back to accusing me of being a troll, or acting like im a pro nazi or something then , or just insult's me in general then......

So then I get more annoyed and call him thing's like a dictator, which as you can see here with our history, this is how he acts.....isn't it true?.....he ignores most of my points and picks and chooses what he wants to answer.....sometimes he won't even answer you at all.....and sometime's he just insults you then . So it's logical if get annoyed and call him a dicator right?

Wrong....Deepak then holds it against you that your name calling him...and threaten's to block you, or report you, or he just tel",1,0,0,0,0,0

""""To these authors an Islamophobic position typically encompasses the belief that Islam intrinsically promotes religious fanaticism, violent tendencies towards non-Muslims, terrorism, and that Islam is intrinsically hostile to concepts such as equality, tolerance, democracy and human rights.""""

Islam does intrinsically promote religious fanaticism, does promote violence and ill-feeling towards non-Muslims, does seem to spawn many terrorists, and is intrinsically hostile to concepts such as equality, tolerance, democracy and human rights.

I thought a phobia was an irrational fear of something. 

I admit that I do fear Islam, the belief system, but I don't consider this a phobia. It seems quite rational to me. I just don't want to see many more countries becoming anything like Iran, with sinners being put to death for commiting """"crimes"""" that are merely breaches of Islam. 

Islam does seem to promote a desire to do away with secular democracies and impose Islam as a form of government. Muslims somehow manage to evoke more uneasiness in me even than George Bush and his loony Fundamentalist Christian friends.

Religion is such a scourge on our species. Killing each other over invisible dieties who don't even exist. Dumb.""",1,0,0,0,0,0

Cena = Gets too much shit from people for no reason. He can't control the way he is booked. I just believe they should stop pushing him before everyone hates him way too much or just turn him heel which would work for me.

Batista = Whines too much about his position in the company and should shut his mouth. Fuck him, job him out to JBL. I use to like him but he has main evented more than Cena and is in a better position than he should be just because of Triple H.

Orton = Does whatever the fuck he wants because he is a main star and friends with Triple H. Should have been fired already for smoking pot in front of everyone. If it wasn't for Triple H, he would be jobbing in TNA right now. Fuck him, that son of a bitch does not deserve the spot he has. He is good of the mic but ring skills lack, headlock after headlock. They compare him to AJ Styles which is a joke in my opinion since AJ has pure wrestling ability.

Triple = Been playing politics for years and deserves to become a jobber for the people he has buried. He tried to keep Booker T and Kurt Angle down. Angle is one of the best wrestlers and if you watch his match with Abyss at Turning Point; which I can give you a link, it is worth the watch trust me; is still doing great things. Booker T deserved a hell of alot more than he did in WWE. I can't stand him and I hope he gets hit by a car. If he ends Taker's streak I will come and burn down WWE head quarters while leaving a message that say another building burns unless Triple H is fired.C """,1,0,1,0,1,0

Obviously, Wikipedia is the encyclopedia only people with proprietary interest in an article can edit. You're part of the problem. Underwood had an effect on the church, or at bare minimum is an 'in-joke' therefore there should be mention of him in the article. I can see your mind is made up though, so I'll save my breath, there's no point having integrity when surrounded by folks determined to enforce their bias and other folks too busy to research the subject properly (it took you several minutes to research hundreds of posts and relationships between church members and Underwood). I'm done. Your arrogance is plain as day. I didn't claim to have made a perfect edit, I even suggested re-editing in the talk page. However Underwood's effect is plain as day, and as such should be mentioned. The reason I'm leery of the 'custodians' of the page is because in adding the Bob Black bombing I encountered the same kind of opposition. I'm not opposed to the Church, I just think that articles deserve more than custodial opinions by caretaker editors who have a vested interest in the outcome of the article. You were just in too big a hurry. I have a fair amount of experience editing, and know that a mention shouldn't require a full-on assault to accomplish when there is proof of association. I'm not trying to make the Church look guilty, just trying to keep accuracy on a topic that (if you research the Underwood article) often has been edited less than veraciously and is a continuously recurring discussion topic in alt.slack even 5 years after the murders. As I indicated in some of my edit summaries, rumor control, not hostile edit, just hostile to those determined to obscure data to save Church face. 71.102.18.173",1,0,0,0,0,0

Obviously, the idiot that wrote """"the need for instant gratification"""" failed economics 101. A need is something you must have for survival; that isn't instant gratification. A want is something that you would like to have but can live without.

The guy that edited this is probably a consumerist moron with thousands in credit card debt. Debtors are fools that shouldn't be allowed to own anything. This is why a fully market economy can't end poverty. Only those with a proper education should be allowed to participate in a market economy. Fools that don't know the difference between a want and a need should be owned by their employer. Their employer can better determine what they need than themselves. Poverty would be eliminated by this mix of a command and market economies. The remaining unemployed, fat, and lazy fools can go to jail.

Having contributed nothing to music himself, it is outrageous that he would have the nerve to attack what is arguably the greatest Queen album.

bac5d7a187cd528a,"Absolute Proof that 0.999... IS NOT EQUAL TO 1 
A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

Hey Merzul, glad you have a sense of humor too.  There is actually a policy that admins are supposed to follow when a block might be controversial.  Obviosuly the admin in question and I have not seen eye to eye on the talk page of an extreemly controversial subject.  According to that policy he should have mentioned his intent to block me the admin notification board to let the other admins know prior top blocking me.  He did not do that.  He also is obligated to provide me with some specifics which he did not do.  And """"Final warning"""" suggests a previous warning had been given.  I would not be shocked if all my comments here get deleted and he uses WP:Soapbox as an excuse.  Oh well, what are you gonna do.  The only thing that bothers me is I cannot post anything on any of the admin boards to get a question or two answered and I cannot post on NCDave's talk page (he would appreciate the irony here I think).  He also deleted my comments on the talk page yet he leaves dozens of actual viscous attacks done by others there, I attacked no one so this selective enforcement makes me smile too.   I suspect the """"batman"""" comment sent him over the top (I'm Batman).  But we have one guy claiming he's a nuclear scientists and therefore evolution is wrong, another guy (who this Night dude is demonstrably sympathetic too) who claims he's a doctor and has proven evolution to be false, so I figured letting the cat out of the bag and admitting I'm batman was just as relevant (shhh mum's the word, my wife would kill me if she knew I was a crime fighter).  The talk page is obviously not a place for people to claim they can/have proven evolution to be wrong nor is it a good place to appeal to one's own authority.  But, in Nightguy's eyes I guess you can claim you're a nuclear scientist but claiming to be batman somehow violates some policy. 

To be clear, I'm seeing this as idiotically funny and not ranting against admins or Wikipedia.  Anyhow, here's to appreciating the occassional absurdity in life!  19:15""",1,0,0,0,0,0

If he gets things wrong, why is he so well respected by all those reporters in the newspapers listed by Interestedinfairness. Answer that one. Dab, don't confuse the issue.

Luckily these morons only know about two celebs I work for, and NONE of my clients could care less about wiki.  What we all care about is the link to the official site so the option for true and relevant information is available to them.  We don't have time to play the wiki-troll game.   So, YES, you can see the history of this omnitroll, and that username was created JUST for editing those two pages.  I expect the user terminated, and the connecting profiles to be found and terminated.  You can see the moronic trail they left in the history, regardless of username.  It's all the same trolls.

Again, we could care less about anything this site offers, but if information of my clients is going to be posted, the link to the official pages MUST be included.

See to it that the links are NEVER removed, and you will NEVER see me again.  Simple as that.

I have several systems to choose from, so edits are never an issue.  Block my ass, and I will still shit on the trolls.

You're actually working against everything that is good about wikipedia, systematically going after people and questioning everything they do. Who told you to do this? Why take the 'law' into your own hands? Ask yourself this: who are you protecting? You wanna play cops and robbers, go and joing the freaking police. Do something useful, rather than wasting your life on here. What is your job? Cos this ain't real life buddy, and if its your only hobby, I feel bad for you. I mean really bad.

6b821ef55b83820d,"Neither shows suck. Even so, comaring TS to KP is like Robt Jones to Teenage Robot - hard desicion.

THEY BOTH REALLY SUCK! Watch something worthwhile like Family Guy or King of the Hill.
That was really mean. Family Guy and King of the Hill are good shows, but so is KP. Don’t get hostile. =D  
One of the things that make the show unique is that it is a comedy aimed at more than just kids, that doesn't revolve around a cliched 'loser' main character. In fact KP is the complete antithesis of a loser and so are her family and most of her friends. Even Ron doesn't really fit the stereotype. Both FG and KOTH can be funny but there comes a point when you want a break from all those cynical shows that are all about laughing at someone's ignorance and stupidity.  
Hey wait a second. Totally Spies sucks. Kim Possible was good, but later jumped the shark. it then became the worst show ever (well, not as bad as totally spies or futurama, but got close). Also, as for another comment above, Teenage Robot  was AWFUL. Robot Jones was way better. And as for the final one, King of the Hill was great, but Family Guy is unfunny. It is better than Futurama though, FUTURAMA WAS THE ABSOLUTE WORST THING EVER MADE!!!!

Don't watch the new KP, watch something good like King of the Hill or Shinigan Down.",1,0,0,0,0,0
