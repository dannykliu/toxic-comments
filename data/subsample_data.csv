Image Tagging Image:Nadia04.jpg

 This media may be deleted.

Thanks for uploading Image:Nadia04.jpg. I notice the 'image' page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you have not created this media yourself then there needs to be an argument why we have the right to use the media on Wikipedia (see copyright tagging below). If you have not created the media yourself then it needs to be specified where it was found, i.e., in most cases link to the website where it was taken from, and the terms of use for content from that page.

If the media also doesn't have a copyright tag then one should be added. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL. If you believe the media qualifies as fair use, consider reading fair use, and then use a tag such as  or one of the other tags listed at Wikipedia:Image copyright tags#Fair_use.  See Wikipedia:Image copyright tags for the full list of copyright tags that you can use.

If you have uploaded other media, consider checking that you have specified their source and copyright tagged them, too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

the article's usage should reflect that of the bay area locality.  Like hell it should.  If that was the standard by which we wrote Wikipedia, there'd be a lot of strange-sounding articles. The standard is clearly laid out in WP:UE, that we use whatever is most commonly reflected in reliable sources.

For now, strange though the inclusion of """"the"""" sounds to my midwestern ears, I must grant that U.S. Geological Survey is a very powerful source supporting inclusion of the """"the"""".  But it is not the only such source, and I consider the question to be an open one.  I have no plans to hunt down other sources to counter it, but I just did not want to allow the canard that local usage is our standard to go by.

 Scarborough Nicknames 

While I don't really want to expand on this section, there are in fact some web references to Scompton:

You know you're from Scarborugh when...
Busta Rules

There is also a wikipedia page called Canadian slang which references Scompton as well as a couple of other nicknames not mentioned in the Scarborough article. I used Clusty search engine to find these references. Up to you whether you want to put this reference back. I don't care one way or the other.

Regards,  

You're absolutely correct.  Serves me right for editing before my first cup of coffee in the morning.  I found nothing relevant for Scompton, but when I redid the search later, I did get results thru a search for Scompton AND Scarborough. I ought not to have deleted the entry based on a Google search turning up nothing.Personally, I generally don't see any value in having a section for nicknames for the municipality.  But there is obviously precedent for having it (e.g. Toronto).  The problem I have with these sections is that they end up including obvious entries (like """"Hogtown"""" for Toronto), but then also up end up including nicknames that may be used in some circles but don't have particularly wide usage.  The particular problem here in the Scarborough article is that so many of the nicknames have such a negative connotation  perhaps that's just a reflection of public perception, but I do believe that it does, to a degree, give the reader the wrong impression of the place.  Frankly, I am just waiting for someone to add """"Scandahar"""" to the list. I'm not from Scarborough, so I will leave the list in the hands of folks who have a better sense of whether its inclusion is justified.  Given your edits to the article, you are probably better placed to make that call than I. Cheers,  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Perspective? 
""""In the trial Shylock represents the Jewish side in contrast to the Christian one in a matter of highest importance: Justice (Jewish, Old Testament) is confronted with Mercy (Christian, New Testament). In the Christian view mercy is the decisive step after justice is reached. Therefore the Christians in the courtroom urge mercy. Beside the fact, that Shylock as a Jew is not in duty to give mercy, he is not able as well, because for this you need love. He doesn't find love at all, but hate. Shakespeare explains this in Shylock's monologue very clearly. To be merciful despite the hate nevertheless you have to love your enemy (New Testament). That means in fact that the Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to behave like a very true Christian by loving his enemies although they themselves failed even in loving just their neighbours (the Jews) in the past before.""""

Ask Nancy: Q/A with Nancy Lieberman
Q: Hi, Nancy. Why do you think the Great Adrienne Goodson of the Sting doesn't get a shot at the National Team? What gives? Yours Truly, -Ralph (Bayonne, N.J.)

A: Speaking from an alumni perspective (Go ODU!), Goodie is a warrior. She won't get a lot of attention, but she just goes about the work and grinds it out. That is why I was really happy that she made the All-Star team in 2002. It just validated how good of a player she really is. People always underestimate her, but she is so mentally tough. She will never get a lot of exposure, but she is vital to the success of the WNBA.    Source: http://aol.wnba.com/features/asknancy_040721.html

JERSEY CITY, NJ - 05/06/2003…Adrienne is often compared to her cousin, Dennis “Lil Pie” Goodson.  His alma mater, New Jersey City University (Jersey City State College) unveiled the newly created Dennis Goodson Memorial Basketball Award, at the Annual Athletic Awards Banquet in 2003.  Dennis competed as a point guard with the school from 1983 to 1987 and was a starter on the school's first Final Four team in 1986. Sadly, he died on June 25, 2002 at the age of 36.  
 
Named in honor of the star point guard, the award is bestowed to either a male or female basketball player at NJCU. The recipient will best exemplify the attributes for which Goodson was known: team loyalty, dedication to the sport of basketball, competitive spirit on the court, knowledge of the fundamentals of basketball, and demonstration of leadership, and sportsmanship.

ca41d8b7afd2fda7,"Perhaps then, the way out is to find a WP:RS that says that these Christian sources may be inflating the figure. Then the article could quote the higher figure (some Christian sources say that the proportion of Christians may be as high as 15% but according to XXXX these numbers may be inflated). Or, if the source (the one claiming that the christian sources are unreliable) then it would be ok to drop the higher number and relegate the info to the religion sub-article. However, failing an external [WP:RS]] confirmation of the motivations of these 'Christian' sources, it is WP:OR to state that 'it's in the interest of these Christian sources to overstate their numbers'. At best, it is as speculative as 'the Egyptian government allegedly being interested in promoting a lower percentage of Christians because of its troubles with Islamic fundamentalists', which, BTW, I did not say is true or even my view, I presented it as a counter hypothesis to the speculation of biased christian sources. The point is that we can't speculate about motives because we don't do WP:OR. We need to look for external sources to guide us on the veracity of information out there. If we can't show that a source is unreliable, and the source is reasonable, we should present their statistics with the appropriate caveats.  (sniff out my socks)",0,0,0,0,0,0

I noticed your involvement in the discussion and your revision of the article creator's illegal closure of the AfD discussion, and I agree that reverting it was the right thing to do, but I'm curious how all this transpired in the first place. As you can see, the article has been deleted, so technically the discussion can't continue any longer (unless an administrator decides to restore it on the grounds of sabotage). What I would like to know is why an administrator deleted it in the first place. How could he or she not have noticed that:
a) The article was closed by someone other than an administrator, and
b) That the discussion was nowhere near the proper minimal closing date of five days after the start of the AfD discussion.

Furthermore, what do you think might have been the creator's motive for declaring Delete as the final decision? None of this makes much sense to me: the hoaxer willingly has his article which he has been fighting to keep for a while deleted, and an administrator wrongly and prematurely deleted the article for some strange reason.

cfaa82c95d5c43ab,"Suspected Sockpuppeteer Turns Out to Be a Human==
Shocking news break.  It turns out that the person who originally supplied the information in ISM is me!  A real 

person.... not a 'sock puppeteer.'  There are no socks and no puppets.  Just a real person who thought that a 

business was significant enough to warrant a pace on Wikipedia.  Someone who actually understands the business he is 

in, unlike the editors, who have no experience in the field whatsoever.

It turns out- or so we can surmise, that there are lots of people who want to learn about this company.  Oh no!  

This can't be!  It's a business... not an encyclopedic fact!  

But an encyclopedia like Wikipedia should include everything in the world.  otherwise, why does it exist?  

Encyclopedia Britannica and the Oxford Encyclopedia are perfectly sufficient.

Geekish editors have said that listing this company is 'blatant advertising.'  Yet other advertising companies, like 

Modernista, BBDO, DDB, Ogilvy, etc. are all here... blatant advertising.  So, how big does a company have to be to 

be listed on Wiki?  The answer- there is no answer.  It's all up to the whims of people who have no knowledge nor 

experience in business, who call themselves Carbuncle, Smeff, Dongfart, and the rest.  This is surely detrimental to 

the Wiki.

Why do people have such a Pyongyang attitude towards this?  The very idea of limiting what is shown here- censoring 

pure facts arbitrarily- is against the very idea of a global Wiki.  The great big idea is that this site is 

developed by the people of the world, and includes all the things that the published encyclopedias, which have been 

around for hundreds of years, do not or cannot include.

To my mind, and all the other sane, normal people of the world, this is all ridiculous.  

Please cite the arguments of What Wiki is Not and all the rest.  It is a shortcut to thinking.  And clearly there is 

very little thinking here.  

I have had repeated emails from people around the world asking why they cannot find ISM on Wikipedia, and many from 

people who either wanted to add information on the company or were looking for information for research.  Everyone 

was rebuffed.  What kind of person would do this- what kind of person would sit in their little room, hiding 

information from others, and trying to keep reality away at any cost?  Sock Puppets?  Suspicious users?  Legal 

threats?  What kind of cowardly fool says these things without simply engaging in a dialogue with the person who 

originally wrote the article and who always- ALWAYS - asked for editor input and support?

Go on- look at the history.  You will see that editor input was always taken at first, despite the fact that all 

editors here are wholly unqualified to make a decision on this subject.  When asked to explain themselves, no one 

had the nous to do so.  Delicious Carbuncle, BlueBoy, Todd1, Fisher Queen, etc.   All refused to answer for their 

actions.  Cowards and buffoons who have no sense, courage, nor intelligence. 

Anyone who makes an attack on another person, as these 'editors' have, and runs away without facing the person they 

have attacked, is  not deserving of their powers.  

I am now convinced that Wikipedia, despite it's noble origins, is just a place for fools to feel power in a world 

where they are unable to have any in reality.  Go ahead and add your ridiculous little code to me and my site.  You 

have no argument and have no intelligence- if you think you do, face me like a real human- talk, discuss, and the 

rest.  Or be a true Wiki editor and make a stupid, sarcastic comment and run away... hiding... and never respond to 

your comments.

Acroterion, I don't believe I need to review or post what a broad cross-section of scholars have to say on the subject.  I believe a 5th or 6th grader could determine the relevance of the facts I propose to post.  

Plus, you are imposing an impossible standard in that most scholars don't state the obvious for obvious reasons.  Why should an accomplished scholar say 1 + 1 = 2 when everyone in his or her audience already knows the answer?  

Here's a reasoned conclusion a 5th or 6th grader could arrive at: Since Fisher's affiliation with the National Lawyers' Guild was already public knowledge, McCarthy didn't do anything wrong by mentioning Fisher was affiliated with the National Lawyers' Guild at the Army hearings. And Welch was wrong to denounce McCarthy for saying that.  I'm not proposing to say that, but the conclusions are inescapable for even a 10-year old.

I do not doubt your good faith, but your analysis and reason appear weak.  No one besides you has raised that objection.

Are there others that join you in raising that objection, because I'm not convinced anyone besides you believes that?

BTW, this appeared on the Army-McCarthy hearings site:  """"At the time Brownell was seeking to designate the NLG as a Communist front organization, and McCarthy mentioning Fisher's membership violated a pre-hearing agreement to not raise the issue as it was still being litigated.""""

These people play little games of waffling back and forth between demands for sources and, when they get sources, questions of relevance. (See Talk:State_terrorism for example.)  When their opponent suggests that they are being less than honest in doing so, these people block them for making personal comments.

 Re: The Call of the Marching Bell 

I'm afraid that I've had to revert your edit.  Frst, your change from Bang-i-dara"""" """"Bang-e-Dara"""" wasn't properly explained.  The sources use a variety of transliterations; for example, the on-line translation uses """"BĀNG-E-DARĀ"""" on the title page and """"Bāng-i-Darā"""" in the text.  Is there good reason to choose one over the other?

Secondly, you seriously over-linked the article.  See Wikipedia:Manual of Style (links)#Overlinking and underlinking: what's the best ratio?:

""""An article may be considered overlinked if any of the following is true:

""""Low added-value items are linked without reason — such as, 1995, 1980s, and 20th century""""

I've replaced some of the goods links that you added, and I've rewritten part of the article so that the problem of transliteration choice is dealt with.   (Talk) 

Hi, while I appreciate your concern for maintianing the quality of the article, I consider your reverts rather abrupt. Except for the linking of years, you do not clearly justify why you reverted other edits:
 E.g. wikilinks to rationality, pragmatism, materialism, spirituality, and patriotism). Although you later re-linked England and Europe and repaired """"articles""""!
 The reason for putting transliterations in Italics is to keep the reader aware of foreign language texts, which is a common practice
 In your edit summary, you blame me for unsourced changes. It is evident that I did not add any new texts for which I had to provide any """"source"""" but if you insist on keeping any part of text, you should provide the relevant citation 
In your edit, you have linked the word Muslim with Islam which are two different articles.
The use of i and e is problematic of transliterating Persian and Urdu texts respectively. But it is good practice to maintain the same standard in one article. The sound of """"e"""" is common pronunciation in Urdu. And as the book predominantly contains Urdu poetry, I followed the same pronunciation pattern.

Ignore everyone and everything but Peterklutz - and ban him.

Instead of flying off the handle like some prepub PMS girl, why don't you start acting like an admin and investigate the contribution pattern of the MMY and TM articles in order to determine the frequency of today's MO (as well as what accounts are involved)? When you do this you may also want to investigate the IPs operating the accounts. When you do this, chances are you'll be in for a surprise.

Since you concievably cannot do more to Peterklutz than you already have, he'll now indulge himself by walking the line to a fresh NPA.

Bishonen, you're positively starting to came across as a serious liability and embarrasment for wikipedia.

How does the language of the Franks, which is known more or less from place names and personal names only plus a few borrowed words, tell us anything about their ethnicity? We knew they were Germanic before that. Are you implying that there is a connection between Dutch and Frankish """"ethnicity""""? That connection, though it is probably there, is not very direct over a thousand five hundred years...
I don't know why the fact that a Frankish-derived language (Dutch) being spoken in a certain region (the Netherlands) should force us to believe that the Franks were originally from there. Of course the two facts are related, but the fact of the language being spoken there does not itself tell us that at one point in time its inhabitants were primarily Franks any more than the fact that a Latin-derived language is spoken in Belgium tells us that at one point in time its inhabitants were primarily Romans. Again, I understand the connection, but it is not made on linguistic analysis alone. This is why most books/articles on the Franks that I've read (Wallace-Hadrill, Bachrach) don't mention Dutch. Your comment about Franci seniores (what does the Franci superiores have to do with anything?) does nothing to explain to me the importance of their language. Their well-attested written language was Latin. Why not mention that? In fact, it tells us far more about the Franks than that they spoke a proto-Dutch language. 
As to the remarks concerning the pertinence of my comments only for the Merovingian period, I was not aware that the article was about the development of a language and not about the Franks, a term which does not have a consistent universal ethnic/tribal meaning by the end of the 9th century (and probably by the end of the 8th). 
In short, I don't see how you have actually answered the objection. I don't know what """"German"""" point of view you think I have, but I find that ridiculous. And shouldn't a minority of scholarship moreso undermine your """"Dutch"""" point of view? Finally, when did I declare myself a Carolingian specialist? I have no specialty.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 New pic  & non-journalistic references 

Hi all. A couple of suggestions for articles like this. If we must use media as the only references (at least in the short term), can we lose the meaningless journalistic terminology? """"14 times closer"""" is meaningless (think """"twice as small""""). Similarly, """"gray line"""", and water and carbon dioxide as """"elements"""". These I have changed, but I'm sure there are others. Finally, couldn't someone modify the stock image used at the end to show where in the potentially-habitable zone this planet would lie?

Again, NK never existed as a region before 1920s. While Nagorno translates as mountainous, it was never a separate region. And NK as a region is separated from Armenia by Kelbajar, Lachin and other districts of Azerbaijan. The sources above do not say that NK existed as a stand alone region historically. Even Russian imperial administrative divisions such as Jevanshir and Shusha uyezds included both mountainous and lowland parts of the region. So we need to clarify that NK as a region did not border Armenia. If we are talking about geographic region of Karabakh, then its mountainous part extends right to the border with Armenia, however upper and lower Karabakh historically formed a single region, and geographic concept of Karabakh includes both highlands and lowlands. The history of NK as a historical and political notion starts in 1920s, when it was artificially carved out of Karabakh to become an autonomy for Armenians. It was purely a Soviet invention. master """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Blatant Violation

Main article: Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons
'When writing about controversies in the lead of the biography of a living person, notable material should neither be suppressed nor allowed to overwhelm' The blockquotes *do* overwhelm the article. SRQ made a unilateral decision to change TWO quotes instead of the one under discussion. In addition the blockquotes make the article look choppy. BRB

Thanks! Your copyedits are much appreciated, as is the advice. To reply to your points:
I was afraid that the section about his books rambled a bit, although I want to make sure to keep enough of it in. Especially in Szigeti on the Violin, he reveals a lot about his personal philosophy of music and violin playing, which (in my opinion)is very important for his biography. That said, I will try trimming it down.
Yes, he was indeed married to the same woman for all those years, and as far as I can tell their marriage was a very happy and harmonious one. There are some nice vignettes of their life together in his autobiography, maybe I'll try to work in a few mentions of domestic life somewhere. 
I had a good laugh at your remark about how I should get academic credit for this, especially because just a few days ago, my obnoxious Music History professor bellowed """"Don't ever look up anything on Wikipedia if you expect to stay in this class!

 Bowie The Secret Life of Arabia 

Hello Ian,

You were quite right to correct my edit. Buckley's comment shouldn't be excised on its own; all of them should go - it doesn't matter who any of these writers are, their aesthetic judgement comments are all just POV opinions (of no greater weight than yours, mine or anyone elses, though Buckley's is particularly ridiculous, let alone in a Wikipedia context) and therefore not encyclopedic in nature and therefore not Wikipedia compliant. 

Even worse is the completely uncited statement above """"Like Bowie's 1971 song """"Life on Mars?"""", it evoked a world where film and reality become merged and confused"""". Says who?? And indeed who cares, Wikipedia is not the place for editors' subjective comments. That is potentially endless.

Wikipedia makes it abundantly clear that it is not a opinion forum, or a vehicle for people's differing aesthetic opinions; it is an encyclopedia.

The only quotes that would be acceptable (and of any interest) in this regard would be one's directly attributable to Bowie, Visconti, Eno etc i.e. the creators themselves. It would be extremely productive to seek any out. What the article needs is facts - for example, details of where recorded and on what dates, who the personel were etc etc, all properly cited.

Either way, all of these comments must go and be replaced by encylopedic content. This is simply just what Wikipedia insists on, rightly as an encyclopedia.

I don't know if you remember Wikipedia:Contributor copyright investigations/Scarfaced Charley from over a year ago – I see he was also blocked as a Sockpuppet. I worked a bit on helping fix some of those.  Yesterday I found that Scarfaced Charley had made a duplicate Campaignbox template and therefore some relevant articles were using that Template:Campaignbox Little Rock while others were using the preexisting Template:Campaignbox Advance on Little Rock which follows the WP:MILHIST convention of naming campaignboxes in accordance with the campaigns defined by the American Battlefield Protection Program unit of the National Park Service. That site is currently unavailable because of the Government Shutdown, but can be verified in Google's cache.

I merged the content into Template:Campaignbox Advance on Little Rock, updated all the articles to use the correct campaignbox template, blanked the duplicate template and tagged it with db-t3. I had originally also put a redirect to the corrected template, but I couldn't figure out how to make both the redirect and the db-3 tag work... Hopefully I've done it correctly. Does this situation indeed qualify for speedy deletion or does it need to be brought to TfD?

This poorly written Wiki article attempts to make it appear that ancient Macedonians were distinct from ancient Greeks. I would gambit the article is largely edited by people from Fyrom/Republic of Macedonia with irredentist aims towards Greece (contrary to both US and UN resolutions to refrain from propaganda against Greek Macedonians). Despite the occasional voice of objections there is no major dispute among most scholars that ancient Macedon was inherently Greek in nature. (at least more than anything else) The Hellenic age (the greek word for what we in english call """"greek"""") is evidence beyond dispute of this.

 To give an example of historical distortions found in this article...

""""Macedon or Macedonia (Greek Μακεδονία Makedonía) was the name of a kingdom centered in the northern-most part of ancient Greece, bordered by the kingdom of Epirus to the west and the region of Thrace to the east.""""

By saying the """"northern-most part of Greece"""" it makes it seem like it bordered Greece. There was no """"Greece"""" state in ancient times... there was only a collection of autonomous city states and Kingdoms that self-identified as Greeks. (Mycenae, Athens, Argos, Ithica, Sparta, Macedon Corinth, etc...) 

Another example of irredentism.... the wiki article states....

""""It became increasingly Atticised during this period, though prominent Athenians appear to have regarded the Macedonians as uncouth[3].

 This statement is very deceptive. It was common during times of conflict for Greeks to label each other """"barbarians"""" (non-greeks) as an insult. (similar to saying """"unAmerican"""" today) 

 While Demosthenes used """"barbarians"""" to describe Macedonians... he also used it describe the Athenean orator Aristogeiton [Aristophanes, ‘Nephelae’ (line 491). And even Demosthenes himself as described by as a """"barbarian"""" by Aeschine. Plato characterized the Lesbian Aeolic Greek dialect as ‘a barbarian register’ while addressing Pittakos of Mytilene. Athenaios VIII 350a  Socrates calls Strepsiadis “ανθρωπός αμαθές ουτώσι και βάρβαρος“.  (Strepsiadis…was a well-known Athenian) - Protagoras 3410 etc... etc... There are countless instances of Greeks describing each other as barbarians.

  There are other examples of bias in the article but the most telling is how it lightly brushs over the Hellenic period of Macedon (similiar to the golden age of Athens).... in which Macedonia spread the Greek Language, Greek culture, and Greek ideas to the region. They unique flavour of macedon among Greeks... was very similar to how Athens also had unique aspects to it... as did Sparta... as did most of the Greek mini-states.

 If Macedon wasn't Greek.... then Greek philosopher Aristotle wasn't Greek either (since he came from Chalcidice in Macedon). To go down this road we would also need to rewrite a fair portion of Wiki articles related to antiquity and the Hellenistic period. To do this to suit the political needs of a country whose population is roughly a quarter Muslim and most of the rest are ethnically slavic (who have called themselves Yugoslavians, Serbians, and Bulgarians in the last hundred years) amounts to roughly helping the Taliban blow up Buddhist statues for political ends. 

 Because of political nature of the article I would advise a complete rewrite by people will credentials in ancient studies. History is not a popularity contest. Just stick to the facts as we know them.  What's ironic is that virtually every last piece of """"evidence"""" that Macedon wasn't Greek... is either translated from Greek or comes from Greek artifacts. The citizens of Fyrom can't even read inscriptions from Macedon... as they are almost all writen in Greek.

Even apart from the fact that you are generalising on several items: mode, temperature, duration of exposure, plus even more pertinent: on source of oil (what plant it is coming from, and which part of it) and whether it is a methyl ester or ethyl ester. In my view it is irresponsible to say categorically that biodiesel is non-toxic.  If you insist then you can sign on the bottom line, if anyone comes to harm from biodiesel of any source and in any application you'll take the responsibility, but I don't think that you would be foolish enough to do that.

As an example: The toxicity of erucic acid (see WP under that title) a component of some canola oils and several others is a contentiou issue. Canola (rapeseed) oil is classed as high, medium and low eruc canola oil and only the low erucic acid canola oil is accepted universally for human consumption.

If you study a textbook on vegetable oils and fats you will find that the composition of an oil can depend on which part of the plant it is coming from.

 R says there is a way to go on WP:MOS which is his area of expertise. I assume if we address each of his points one by one then that should improve matters. He does not suggest going for GA but that is still an option.
 He thinks the UN references look reliable - but not sure if this is a comment on npov too.
 Perhaps we need additional comment on the subject area, npov and other aspects of the article as well as WP:MOS etc.

 Shark urine? Really? 

I can buy that shark biltong is an acquired taste. But given that shark meat is not a terribly uncommon food, I'd like to see a reference on shark biltong being objectionable because it tastes of shark urine. The implication also seems to be that it's the shark skin that's the problem (""""sharks urinate through their skin""""), but there's no indication that skin is included in the biltong. Nor is there any reason to assume that the urine flavor (presuming there is one at all) should be concentrated at the skin; given that the process of shark urination is an osmotic exchange, the urine should be evenly distributed throughout the system, and, if anything, *less* concentrated at the skin.

There are only a very few conference series in the world for which there are truly substantial third party references, but there are many of great importance: the situation is similar to journals. In practice, tho we don't word it that way, the effective criterion for journals is that papers there are highly cited (as measured by the impact factor from  Journal Citation Reports). This can apply to conferences also. The difference is that for most conferences, the papers there are preliminary results and not rigorously peer reviewed & therefore  not highly cited as compared with journal papers by the same authors. There are two classes of exceptions: ones where the papers are major review articles in the field, and ones in engineering where they are the basic means of publication.  I'm not sure about this one. Ido not think it is  one of these exceptions, and I think the publications are mainly just abstracts, as is common with many conferences.  I would need to check, & I  cannot do it this week.  
But personally, I would include in WP articles about all journals used as references here, and all major conference series, however, I doubt this would have consensus.  The compromise solution is therefore to write the articles about the sponsoring society and have a section on the conference. That is probably the best thing to do here.

 Sorry if this seems stupid, but I don't know why this article exists. Do we also need to prove that 4 is bigger than 3? That 50 is bigger than 1.2? No.
 
The facts are:
 22/7, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, is 3.1429.
 It is trivial to demonstrate that fact.
 π, rounded to the nearest ten-thousandth, is 3.1416.
 That 3.1429 > 3.1416 is a triviality, not worth an article.
 BUT: The fact that π is approximately 3.1416 can be seen only be first doing quite a lot of work, some of it relying on methods that are relatively sophisticated by comparison to the bare statement that π is the ratio of the circumference of a circle to the diameter, or the like.
 By contrast, the proof given in the article shows that 22/7 > π in a way that is quick and simple, unlike all the work needed to see that π is approximately 3.1416, so you can see that 22/7 > π while skipping all the labor involved in seeing that π is about 3.1416.

The most pressing reason to revert the changes is because the substituted version contains no inline references, but only a list of books and papers at the end. As I don't have access to these, I can't (even if I had the time) go through them and add page references to each sentence or paragraph. Also, although this is more easily rectified, the substituted version contains not a single wikilink, which makes it difficult for the reader to get a sense of context. Wikipedia is built on internal linking. 

It is also built on collaboration between editors. The substituted version was, as far as I can see, a complete rewrite, taking no account of the previous work done.

Everybody: you're wrong. Everyone here except Bretonbanquet has said that they think that the numbering should continue on side two. This isn't about what anyone thinks; it's about reliable sources - in this case, the label of a vinyl record. It is also about reality - and as usual, people here are trying to make Wikipedia into an alternative universe rather than an encyclopedia. So, in a nutshell, it doesn't really matter what any of you think. If you can produce a copy of this or any album where the numbering on side two is continued from side one, rather than beginning again from track one, by all means, it should be noted in the article, because that would be an accurate representation of how the record was presented to the public, as well as a reliable source. Problem solved. By arbitrarily deciding on a numbering system that is contrary to what actually exists in the real world, you are using original research, which some people here tend to frown upon. As far as the problem of younger people not understanding the numbering: even today's young people are capable of working out the logic behind something with two different """"sides"""" being numbered differently.

You're problem is you lack the ability to infer information which is unfortunate, because it is quite a useful tool.

As for the debate about having an article for each episode, I have looked for episode summaries for Friends before and they are not very in depth.  What I was hoping to achieve in the wiki medium was to create relationships between plots and characters that may not be obvious in a regular 'summary' format.  As another example, considering the legacy of Star Trek (and the obvious abundance of info on the series on the 'net), I think the Wiki entries for episode guides did an exceptional and unique job.

Hi, I've  to get users to multi-license all of their contributions that they've made to either (1) all U.S. state, county, and city articles or (2) all articles, using the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike  (CC-by-sa) v1.0 and v2.0 Licenses or into the public domain if they prefer.  The CC-by-sa license is a true free documentation license that is similar to Wikipedia's license, the GFDL, but it allows other projects, such as WikiTravel, to use our articles.  Since you are among the top 1000 Wikipedians by edits, I was wondering if you would be willing to multi-license all of your contributions or at minimum those on the geographic articles.  Over 90% of people asked have agreed.  For More Information:
Multi-Licensing FAQ - Lots of questions answered
Multi-Licensing Guide

To allow us to track those users who muli-license their contributions, many users copy and paste the """"{{DualLicenseWithCC-BySA-Dual}}"""" template into their user page, but there are other options at Template messages/User namespace.  The following examples could also copied and pasted into your user page:

f3998c1c6b2d9e6f,"""==King George County, VA==

There seems to be some a contridiction of the status of King George County. The King George County page indicates that King George County is NOT a part of the Washington-Baltimore Metropolitan Area. Yet, according to the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area page, it is.

This also brings to light a local controversey regarding King George County and whether or not it is part of the Northern Neck of Virginia. Historically, King George County has been included as part of the Northern Neck. The Northern Neck Tourism Council website lists locations in King George County amongst its historical sites and museums, and the King George County Homepage labels the county as the """"Gateway to the Historic Northern Neck"""". I was educated in Northumberland County, Virginia, and this is what we were taught during our segment on local history for 11th grade US History, that there are FIVE counties in the Northern Neck, including King George County.

However, until 11th grade, I had always grown up under the assumption that the Northern Neck consisted of only four counties: Northumberland, Lancaster, Westmoreland, and Richmond counties. Locals think of the Northern Neck more as a community with similar  values and interests, rather than a geographical area. King George county is considered to be """"suburban"""", part of the Washington DC urban sprawl and therefore doesn't share the same community interests as the rest of the Northern Neck.

This article from the Fredericksburg Free-Lance Star highlights both sides of the King George debate.

The inclusion of King George County as part of the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area stems from three facts: King George's proximity to Fredericksburg, its inclusion in the Washington DC media market, and the presence of the Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren. However, the historical connections between King George County and the Northern Neck shouldn't be dismissed. It wouldn't be inappropriate to consider King George County as part of both, as Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area seems to be a statistical category, while the Northern Neck is a historical/geographical region.

I have also added this discussion to the pages on both the Baltimore-Washington Metropolitan Area and the King George County pages. If there is no further discussion or objection, I will edit the Northern Neck page to include mention of the local debate on the status of King George County.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is distinct from verifiability and reliability of sources, and is a lower standard than notability. This criterion applies only to articles about web content and to articles about people, organizations, and individual animals themselves, not to articles about their books, albums, software, or other creative works.

Hence the other component, which represents the velocity of the particle relative to the rotating frame, must be radial.

Curious but unreferenced

Pig War is curious and has a great potential! that is, the article. Two words of note:
 Don't insert links to wikipedia articles in footnotes. Use direct links to actual sources (or reference to printed sources). A reference linking just """"Statistik Austria"""" makes an impression of a fake ref, and few people will care to explore the subject in depth. These will be reverted on sight.
 Have some consideration as to where you insert links to the article. Some of these look like spamming. The 1906 affair has little relevance for post-war Austria - the economic growth after the Anschluss and the destruction of 1945 were orders of magnitude higher than any event preceding WW1.

 Tips for developing country outlines 

Instructions for developing country outlines is located at  

 A note concerning redlinks... 

Many of the entries (and their links) are standard across all of the country outlines, to aid readers, especially young readers, in comparing countries to each other.

So if this country doesn't have any of a particular entry, like navies, please don't delete the entry.  Instead, complete it with """"none"""" (and a brief explanation as to why, for example, """"- x is a landlocked country with no ports"""").  If the explanation exists in an article on Wikipedia, then click on the redlink and create a redirect to that location.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

Standard redlinks (article names) were also chosen based on how country coverage tipically expands.  This makes the standard names for these subtopics widely available and easily accessible.  So please do not remove those redlinks, for they will turn blue eventually.  In the meantime, they can be redirected to the section of whatever article has the relevant information, if any.  See Wikipedia:Redirect, WP:Section linking, and Help:Section#Section_linking.

Thank you.The Transhumanist    

P.S.: To discuss the standard design of the country outlines, or of outlines in general, do so on the Outline of knowledge WikiProject talk page.

 Guidelines for outlines 

Guidelines for the development of outlines are being drafted at User:The Transhumanist/Outline of knowledge.

Placenames in Kosovo

Please, before making or discussing changes to the names used in all Kosovo-related topics, review carefully our general naming conventions and the specific ones on geographic names, using English & settlements.

In short, they ask us to reflect common English usage (which will often will be a local name, or one of them; but not always), because those are the forms our intended readership of English speakers would most easily recognize.

For a number of historical reasons, the English language has adopted the Serbian forms. We merely restrict ourselves to reflect this usage. Wikipedia is not a venue to advocate the adoption of the Albanian names by the English language.

In any case, it's not clear what makes Hip Hop World an independent third party source as linked above.
I can't actually see from your text how he meets the notability criteria linked above anyway
it was written in a promotional tone. Articles must be neutral and encyclopaedic. Examples of unsourced or self-sourced claims presented as fact include:  He fell in love with hip hop... also inspired... he became interested in the art of lyricism, deciding to further his passion... decided to follow his passion... Known for being able to sing and rapping in pidgin or Yoruba... interest for music became a greater calling he could not ignore... was able to explore his range of musical talent... did not however leave him lacking in his ability to contribute... but it was all good natured fun... working diligently... to give his fans the music they so rightfully deserve...— it's long on mind -reading, opinions and spam, and short of real facts, such as record sales, awards etc.

 There are 28 names in the list while there are 27 in the newspapers (the additional name is Charles Muir) and while the body of the article states 'She was carrying a crew of 26 (some reports say 27) and laden with general cargo and a consignment of 20,000 bricks.'

 Edit request from Jayjoanz, 14 February 2011 

Please add the following information to the """"Public Image"""" section of Lady Gaga's page:

Lady Gaga's public perception is always amongst the most controversial of topics in popular culture. Debate about her style and influence on youth stems from her unceasing desire to walk the thin line between daring and inappropriate. The pop stars ability to command the attention of her fans and critics is unmatched and with a growing list of hit records she has solidified herself as a marketable brand. Her 2.8 million Twitter followers and 5.2 million Facebook fans represent evidence of her ability to move product (Hampp, 2010). With opposing ideals about the negative or positive impact of her music, fashion, and public statements there is little question that the benefits of her talent outweigh the detriments. Her fan base and customer base are similar in nature because they are both drawn to her outspoken and outrageous personality (Hampp, 2010).

Works Cited
Hampp, Andrew. """"GAGA, OOOH LA LA: WHY THE LADY IS THE ULTIMATE SOCIAL CLIMBER."""" Advertising Age 81.8 (2010): 42. Communication & Mass Media Complete. EBSCO. Web. 13 Feb. 2011.

  

I think that section already basically says that.  Also, we don't list how many Twitter followers and Facebook followers a person has because there's no way to really verify that information  are those real people?  Are there any sockpuppet accounts?  Anyway, the article basically says all that already.   

 Drug-taking? 

Shouldn't something be said about her drug taking. She admitted it on her CBS 60 Minutes interview that she smokes A LOT of pot while writing music, while drinking whiskey. It's mentioned on other musician's articles, so why not here? 90.193.141.136  
I'm surprised her former cocaine habit isn't mentioned here as well, seeing as she's talked about it in multiple places now (60 Minutes, Vanity Fair). 128.163.242.6  

 Edit request from Cvachov, 18 February 2011 

1986–2004: Early life

Lady Gaga was born Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta, to an Italian American family, in New York City on March 28, 1986,[11] 

...in Yonkers. NY...

Yonkers is it's own city and not part of New York City, it is located in Westchester County, not one of the five boroughs. 

  

 Per the cited source, """"Birth Place: New York, NY."""" It does not state Yonkers. If you check the talk page history, you'll also see that this issue has been researched and discussed at end, and established consensus is that she was not born in Yonkers. —' (talk) 

 Early Management requested addition 

Frank Fredericks, a fellow freshman at NYU, recognized Stefani's talent when they competed against each other in a campus talent show.  Fredericks began managing Stefani in the Spring of 2005, booking her shows at the nearby club the Bitter End.  They worked together for over year, until she began working with producer Rob Fusari.

In particular, look at this edit of Battle of Kosovo where Forsena goes against all the cited references, and actually *removes* most of them. On the matter of 'disputed country' versus 'disputed region', if Angelo continues to make that change without getting consensus first, it would be worrisome. Though your point about the Balkan topic ban is noted, since Forsena has not edited any articles since it was announced, it is too soon to give him credit for following it.

 Walking in on the middle of an argument 

Thanks for the message, however the analogy you've chosen is incorrect, when I walk in on an argument then I cannot have heard what has happened before, however on a talk page I can read the whole thing and trace any talk page discussion. When I posted my first question was intentionally dumbed down, as if I didn't know what was going on, then as the replies came in I could respond to them. In terms of NPOV in articles this is how I see it; for example, person A writes and article which contains the phrase """"Scientology is bad"""", there is then an article written about Person A, Mr A was born in..., and on..., and live with..., et cetera. Then under his work it says """"He wrote an article saying 'Scientology is Bad'"""". I could not in all conscience remove that statement from the article, because the bias is from the speaker not the editor. The gist of the talk page on WP:SCN was that any negative comments which had been quoted accurately but were negative should be """"balanced"""" out. And that is not something I could let happen.

7fa8155b9f441d5c,"Nephilim deleted edit 

You state reliable sources. The first part of my edit is that which is taught in college (you would know if you ever attended). It is taught in literature class. It is: When studying this passage, or any passage of the Bible, it is best to use the Exegetical method, which is tearing it down to the bottom and rebuilding it using 6 contexts. First, one must use the Bible to interpret the Bible. Second, using the 6 contexts, which are: 1. What is the context (main idea, or thought) of the Bible?, 2. What is the context of the book you are reading (Genesis, Exodus, etc.)?, 3. What is the context of the chapter you are reading?, 4. What is the context of the verse you are reading? 5. What is the context of the key words?, and 6. What is the historical context? How did the people of that time think, act, etc. An example, to name something is to place one's authority on it. A king of a city state that has conquered another city state gives it a new name, because he is place his authority on it. Two things to keep in mind for a sound, correct interpretation of this passage are: 1. Where is the beginning of the narrative; the pivotal spot? It is Genesis 3:15, which is a prophecy of Christ and the beginning of the battle between evil and good. It is followed by the first example the story of Cain and Abel., 2. In the original Bible there were no chapter or verses, these were added later to make it easier to find passages. The story of the Flood begins at Genesis 4:17 and goes to Genesis 9:7 (this story should have been 1 chapter).
This aids the scholar attempting to understand and interpret a difficult passage. 
The next part: Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-27-5, New Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson; Kregel Publications 1987, ISBN 0-8254-4030-0/ both page 185)renders the word nephilim meaning as to fall upon other in rapine violence and apostates fallen from true religion. Strong's Exhaustive Concordance Of The Bible Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary, James Strong (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-01-1) cites the word as a bully,tyrant, or dictator. 
Here is given references to where the data is gotten (even page numbers), but by what you say this is reliable or acceptable. Just what would be.
The next part: One can get copies of the First and Second Book of Enoch, which one can read. Two such books are The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Vol 1(Doubleday & Co. Inc., 1983 ISBN 0-385-09630-5)and The Other Bible(Harper & Row, Publishers ISBN 0-06-250031-7)and there others. A WARNING. When reading these books keep in mind that they are non-canonical and are considered fictional; not God inspired and truthful. When one reads the Book of Enoch one sees a measurement for the offspring as 300 cubits. A cubit is 18 inches (check any Bible dictionary), or 1 1/2 feet. As such the offspring is 450 feet tall.
This again shows where one can find the data. All these references are from PUBLISHED and ESTABLISHED books, that is accepted by college professors, but not by you. How did the article get on Wikipedia? Did the author bribe someone, or is it that they are a dear buddy?
You may think this harsh, and it may be, but it is deserved. The reason why the information has been verified with published authentic sources that you refuse to accept. Then what needs to take place is that the articles references must be rejected as well for they are based on the same method and material. Why accept one person's references and not an others when both are from published established sources available to the public.
Once before I attempted this folly on an other article and again nothing, not even a police report, was accepted. The only thing I can think for this is that Wikipedia employees are not getting their palm greased, or that I am not a dear buddy with an in.
The reliable verified referenced attainable data is beneficial and helpful to the reader and scholar, but you and Wikipedia don't care, and spit on me, my effort to help, and the ones who would have benefited from it.

As with a lot of the details of Plato's life, there is no contemporary source concerning this story.

Fair use rationale for Image:Stolen_logo.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Stolen_logo.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box.

I noticed that you and I seem to post in one or two articles dealing with progressive issues in political science/sociology.
There's currently a debate beginning in Boston Tea Party as to whether the article should include the category . It meets definitions set in the articles Terrorism and Definition of terrorism, however, there are several self-proclaimed patriots who watch BTP who refuse to recognise the fact.
The simple criteria for terrorism generally seem to be intimidation or destruction of property in order to change public policy or public opinion while a state of war has not yet been declared. Some users would rather use recent acts of terrorism as a yardstick, rather than using a firm definition, and hence lose their ability to discuss matters calmly.

Eichenwald

One thing that caught my attention when I read the NYT article was the claim that Justin gave his """"customer records"""" to the Times, and they checked the 1500 """"pedophiles"""" and found they were from all walks of life.  Now, at the time Justin shut down his porn operation, he was a legal adult, and was running a web site indistinguishable from any other pay adult site, replete with the required notice that """"All Models are over 18 years of age, records on file.""""  Does that mean that anyone who paid for access to that Web site with a credit card got lumped in with the people who paid Justin for webcam performances when he was 14?  This is the kind of shoddy agenda-laden reporting typical in these cases.  Does anyone remember when the US government busted an age verification service because two web sites that used their codes, located in foreign countries, had underage material on them?  They then characterized everyone who'd bought an age verification code as """"people who had paid for access to child porn,"""" and shopped the customer list around to a bunch of other countries for sting operations.

Any reporting on alleged child porn in the US suffers from a number of problems, most notable of which is the fact that even journalists are legally prohibited from looking at the material in question to report to readers whether its content is being lied about.  It's basically a situation in which you can write anything, no matter how outrageous, about """"international pedophile rings"""" and """"luring"""" and """"poor little abused children"""" and it will get published with no fact-checking, and in an environment in which no one can be publicly suspicious about its claims, for fear of attracting negative attention to themselves.

I haven't seen a single article in the mainstream press in the last ten years on the subject of child porn that wasn't deliberately inflammatory, dripping with value-laden terminology, and full of deliberate lying by omission, juxtiposition, and innuendo.  Mr. Eichenwald's relationship with Justin Berry clearly violated almost every rule of objective journalism.  Given that the NY Times article is a single source for the entire Justin Berry story, basing an encyclopedia article solely on that article, and on derivative journalism generated by it, is an example of """"truthiness,"""" not """"factiness.""""

Thanks for uploading Image:Watson Brown.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first fair use criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed image could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this image is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the image description page and edit it to add {{Replaceable fair use disputed}}, without deleting the original Replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace the fair use image by finding a freely licensed image of its subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or a similar) image under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified how these images fully satisfy our fair use criteria.

Lanier see """"Trinitarian Idealism,"""" pp 135-147, esp. Syllabus II, p 136

1) First of all, none of the sources cited say anything about the three context """"forming a triunism or trinity"""". None of them. Your claim that this is """"According to orthodox Jewish eschatology and Christian eschatology, and secular historians and scholars"""" is completely unsubstantiated by the citations given.
2) Secondly, all three of the sources you cite are sources which you have been told repeatedly not to use because they are not WP:RS. One of them is predictably yet another link to the website on which your own work is advertised, with your idiosyncratic view. So you're not adhering to Wiki policy, and you're deliberately disobeying what you've been asked to do on many previous occasions. Your edit here is a typical example of your WP:SYNTH and WP:OR.
3) Thirdly, you haven't ever provided a single quotation from Bruce or Reed which shows they support your idiosyncratic """"triunisms"""" idea. Your claim that they do is completely unsupported by the works of theirs which you cite, and is another example of your WP:SYNTH and WP:OR. You can't point to something they've written and claim that because you interpret it as supporting your view, that it supports your view. That's not how Wikipedia works. You need a third party citation from a WP:RS which interprets them as supporting your view.You have been told this repeatedly.~~~~

What was challenging? 
For film's that propose questions about reality and controversy- an opportunity is deemed by users to not only post information about the film/actors/production, etc, but also to discuss themes present in the movie. Drifting away from that note, the article itself meets the standards to being a good article. There are little to none spelling errors, and information is almost spot-on with the right dates, people, and nomination facts. But that may be the overall problem of this article...is it too much factual based? Are people necessarily not focused on the article itself but rather the movie? In order to improve not only the article but the revisions to the essay, I will focus on how the film can compare to previous NASA space missions.

Factual Errors/ Scientific Accuracy
-Stars do not twinkle in the realms of space. If you are located on the earth’s surface, you might witness the twinkling of stars because of the earth’s atmosphere. 
-When Kowalski and Stone are stuck between cords in a spacecraft, Kowalski orders to be let go of and is then sent through space, floating away with decreasing oxygen levels. This is incorrect because both are in the same orbit, so a small tug would have worked to pull Kowalski toward safety. 
- When Dr. Stone gets back into the spacecraft, she initially takes off her spacesuit. Two parts are missing: Liquid Cooling & Ventilation Garment. In the film, Stone goes through an extreme amount of stress and excitement, leaving her to be awfully sweaty underneath her spacesuit. However, as she takes it off, there are no signs of sweat, which does not make sense.

Hello,

It's good to hear from you, my tuneful friend.

I am aware of the British custom of holding a commission in a """"home unit"""" while serving with the RFC. I used the term """"transfer"""" because Ball had given up his commission in infantry and carried his commission only in the RFC. Thus he was no longer """"seconded"""". However, he transferred from unit to unit. So, you see, there can be a slight difference between """"seconding"""" and """"transfer"""".

I am trying to bring Albert Ball up to Featured Article status as part of my cleanup effort. At present, I am wrapping up all my WP projects, so that I leave no mess behind. After that I don't know...the assessment rules of the WP game make for a game I feel is not worth playing, and being only a mere writer among all the code monkeys is wearing. And I do have a final draft of a novel to work upon, and the concept of another....

But, as I said, good to hear from you.

  

My point was simply that while one source may say """"transferred"""", and another """"seconded"""" there is in practical terms no real difference between what happened in either case, and hence no need to either edit or revert an edit to switch beween the terms. """"Transfer"""" is possibly the clearest term for modern readers, although original sources generally prefer """"seconded"""" when they talk about transfering between branches of the service rather than specific units. Never heard of anyone """"giving up a commission"""" in the army to join the RFC - it wasn't a separate service until after Ball's death so this just doesn't make sense. Never mind - not as if any of this matters, it was just a thought.
Sorry to hear you are getting WP burnout - happens to us all sooner or later I fear. Good luck with the novel. Is it based on your own service years?

NPOV concerns

I tend to agree with the NPOV concerns of some comments here.  They seem to be more along the lines of what is *not* included than what is.  To be fair, a google search returned far more of the 'critical' sources than any other.

However, I was able to make a minor edit I regard as an improvement. I replaced one Guardian article, """"Iran contra men return to power"""" with another from the same publication, the """"Negroponte: Amercia's voice of experience"""" article.

I believe the former article is redundant to many of the others, and as the least specific to Mr. Negroponte is the least relevent.  The latter article I believe balances the collective tone of the references, and does not omit mention of the Honduras accusations.

However, I have retained the old article here:

That grin of yours is just so cute. The passage you cite from Buchanan's speech is merely his take of the facts presented in a historically prominent September 2000 position paper from the Project for a New American Century, the group from which G.W. Bush's inner circle and cabinet was drawn, and it did include Wolfowitz, Cheney, et. al. And the group had previously  urged then-President Clinton to attack Iraq, as well. Given your liking for history, you should find the position paper interesting. Try searching the document for """"new Pearl Harbor"""" for example.

The article has been under some intense copyediting and scrutiny for preparation for a featured article. The plot summary should stay as it was. Quotes at the beginning of the article are not a good idea.   

I don't know if this is what you had in mind, but it's something I noticed a few years back. I first read TKAM in 1960 (I was 9) and since then I've read it at least once a year. It is a rare book that you can read over and over and still find new things. About 5 years ago I read the book and about half way down the first page I realized that in the universe that Harper Lee created in this book, the actual story is very simple and innocent - Scout is just explaining how Jem broke his arm. I have always plumbed the depths of this book, talked about the profundity, it's allusion, the allegory. But this reread I reckon I saw things through Scouts eyes and just listend to what she was saying. To paraphrase - When my brother Jem was 13 he broke his arm badly at the elbow - Then she tells the events that lead up to this happening. Might not be what you want, but I think it's fascinating!   

 Atticus=protagonist? 

The quote in the second paragraph identifies Atticus as the protagonist, but I was always under the impression that Scout was the protagonist, since all the events revolve around her perspective (I even said she was the protagonist in my addition to the Plot Summary section.  Am I wrong, or is the quote mistaken, or what?  What needs to happen in either case? It may not even be that big of a deal, but I'd like to get an answer.  -  
Atticus is not described as the protagonist by the article, but by a legal writer. He has been the subject of more papers in legal journals than any of the other characters in any sort of writing, so it bears pointing out that fame in the lead. I've had to remove information about Atticus per the suggestions of other editors who are assisting me in preparing the article for feature, and Atticus has his own article, that I shifted some information to.

 """"... which was/were rarely..."""" would be clearer, so """"mentioned"""" can't be read as a verb (which I did, when it occurred at the end of a line).

Thanks for the heads up, Outriggr. And thanks for reading it.   
In the film version Tom is shot while being transported to the prison, it is implied that he was killed and then the story about him running away was made up to hide the blatant murder.  In the book it is much less clear, even on my 5th reading this thought did not enter my mind (that he was murdered and the story was invented to hide the fact).  I think the interpretive twist in the film changes the impact considerably.  It highlights how society is on trial rather than racism.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 67.159.71.32

 2010 team roster 

Moved from User talk:Kevin McE

Hi there. I wonder if you might be able to clarify your reason for making this edit where you cited WP:CRYSTAL. I'm not clear on why the information you removed is inappropriate. Thanks.   

I don't know what needs to be explained.  We cannot say with certainty that those riders will ride for that team next year, because we do not know the future.  An encyclopaedia reports facts, not expectations.    

Hi again. Firstly, I moved your comment back here to keep this in one place so it is easier to follow. I am still not clear exactly what at WP:CRYSTAL makes this content inappropriate. This is not a predicted team roster, it is verifiable and very likely to be accurate since the chance of Team Sky confirming they have signed a contract with a rider for 2010 and then that not happening must be very slim.   

It is verifiable that these men have signed to ride for that team next year, that is in the preceding paragraph and I would not challenge the appropriateness of stating that.  A 2010 roster (not a word that should be used on an article about a UK subject, but that is a different matter) is not something that exists in 2009, and even as a speculative list, it is so incomplete as to be meaningless; it also does not use the cycling squad template which is standard for team articles, but these are not the point.  Returning to the Crystal balling issue, you say yourself that the chance of them not riding is very slim: you thus acknowledge that this is a possibility, and therefore their inclusion in the squad is not a definite fact.  Let's hope it doesn't happen, but Sky might go bust, or any one of the signed riders might have a career ending injury, before 1 January, in which case 2010 will arrive, they will not be part of the team, and the encyclopaedia will be guilty of having recorded an error.  Facts, not expectation.    

I will happily accept that the signing of a contract to ride for the team in 2010 doesn't mean that any of these will actually ride for the team in 2010 and that the team might not even exist. However, all these riders have been signed up to ride for the team in 2010, that makes them part of the squad for 2010. We're not simply expecting them to be, they are confirmed to be. Surely though, we would be speculating if we were to disregard that and suggest it might not happen. I think you are misinterpreting WP:CRYSTAL. I'd suggest that it makes it clear that it is perfectly acceptable to include details of future events providing the information is verifiable, as is the case here. If it turns out that any or all of these riders don't ride for Team Sky in 2010 then the Wikipedia article won't have been """"guilty of having recorded an error"""" because it was an entirely accurate description of the situation at this time based upon the information available.   

I'm not saying that it won't happen, nor that it is not very likely, but that it is expectation, not fact.  You speak of verifiability, but life teaches us that the future is not verifiable.  If they were to die before the end of this year, they will not be in the 2010 team: the future is not confirmed.  An """"entirely accurate description"""" of something that does not currently exist is not possible (and as a description, a 6 man top level racing squad is not entirely accurate).   

I find your position on this matter a little strange. You seem to want to defend the article from speculation but in doing so, seem to be introducing your own speculation that the team might not exist or the riders might change. The names that are being announced are for the 2010 squad, so it seems perfectly appropriate to describe the list as such. We can, and should, only base the article on what can be verified at the current time, and that is that the riders named are part of the team for 2010. The information we have at the current time says these individuals are confirmed to ride for the team in 2010 and our article is, and should, only ever be based upon information available at the time. I would note that, not only has another user reverted the change you made which I am concerned about here, but also that a further ten names have been announced",0,0,0,0,0,0

Notability of Matthew rizzotti
A tag has been placed on Matthew rizzotti requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

The aggressiveness and one sided-ness of people like Gryffindor and noclador has always been offensive to me, what can I say?

The name of the page itself is taken from Brittanica.  Even on the Bolzano provincial website, one of the English documents says Province of Bolzano.  Look, you guys can do anything you want.  If you change it to South Tyrol, I hope it really makes all of you finally happy with your lives.

Well, you could also read her bio... Leo's bio, on the other hand, doesn't say anything about a gender, or about the character trying to look like a boy.
It's pretty easy to come up with some evidence that Makoto is a girl, but I've yet to see somebody pull that off with Leo...
something which keeps coming up is that Leo is a boys name. Well considering the she's obviously trying to look like a boy (probably so Kazuya doesn't recognise her so her revenge will be easier to gain - yeah, yeah, speculation) it makes sense that she's actually called Leona and Leo is (a) a shortened version of that and (b) conveniently plays into the tomboy image.
Actually, I could think of a more plausible explanation for the name: if, like you just theorized, Leo wants to stay incognito, I would think she (assuming Leo's a """"she""""... still your theory)'d better change her name... Maybe she's not really called """"Leo"""" at all. Maybe the name is part of the """"boy"""" disguise. 'Seems more logical and simple to me, anyway.
Remember, in Japan tomboys will use """"boku"""" rather than """"watashi"""" and will get called """"kun"""" rather than """"chan"""" - all things that technically explicitly mark them as male.
Not sure why you're saying that... Does Leo refer to himself/herself as """"boku""""? Besides, if Leo is a girl posing as a young man, she could go as far as to call herself """"ore,"""" really...
Anyway... Namco kept Leo out of a list of the Tekken 6 women/girls, and the character has been said to be male several times in Japanese magazines. So if Leo is a girl, she's secretly a girl... and there has been no big reveal as of yet. In fact, there's even a possibility Namco is trying to keep Leo's real gender a riddle and has no intentions of confirming it one way or the other, ever. Yumeji (from the Samurai Spirits series) would be a precedent. 81.56.14.31

Compromise (I hope): Start a Minor Houses of A Song of Ice and Fire or thereabouts. Move the info about their history there, as well as the key points there. Move complete Roose and Ramsey bios to minor characters. However, I think this particular article should be kept around for 2 reasons:
1. Simply put, it's a good idea to centralize information. Somebody who's reading minor houses and wants to read about Roose and Ramsey will find it easier and more intuitive to go to a House Bolton entry than a minor characters entry. 
2. From all indications, the Boltons will be major players in ADWD (I think Martin saying that a Theon is coming back is better than mere """"speculation""""). Every major Westerosi institution that's had a POV centered on it (major houses, Night's Watch, Citadel) has an article. It seems pointless to get rid of this now and bring it back a year later.

(r to my favorite editor, started before Spotfixer commented:)
Not months, years. He'd been shoveling that shit on Shapiro since 2006. Anyway, thanks for the kind words - coming from one in your time and place it's especially touching that you'd be aggrieved over my two week time out from a website.
I often despair of ever getting anything done here. The most basic, obvious, and straightforward applications of policy often take many man-hours, and even a victory never establishes any kind of precedent - the same discredited arguments are just brought to a new forum. Outright deceit goes unpunished; editors say X=100, citing a source that says X=-5, and get away with it. I mean, look at my own block log, for example.
The first time I was blocked, it was because a devotedly Jewish and obsessively Zionist admin baited me until he ran out of his 3 reverts - he actually put """"rv#1, rv#2, rv#3..."""" in his edit summaries - then, literally five minutes later, a notorious """"kamikaze edit warrior"""" with a laser-like focus on Israeli-Palestinian articles shows up to make his first ever edit to the article, I revert him, and then I've crossed the magic 3RR trip wire and I'm blocked. Ffs, even the guy that blocked me - who incidentally was a United States Air Force reservist with a combat record over Afghanistan - ended up scolding Humus Sapiens for his actions. But no sanctions, of course - that's reserved for people who say """"fuck"""" or click """"undo"""" four times instead of three, not for deranged ethno-nationalists who conspire in secret. Those types get admin bits instead, in honour of all the vandalism they've cleansed from articles about Pokemon.
The second time I was blocked, it was because I lost my temper with a semi-literate buffoon, who quoted in boldface """"huge numbers of Palestinians were also driven out of their homes by their own leaders and/or by Arab military forces"""" claiming it supported his text, """"the vast majority of Palestinians fled of their own accord."""" He quoted this triumphantly, as if he had convincingly refuted my argument and exposed me as a liar. The microcephale in question now appears to be on track to becoming an admin. He'll be in good company.
This is not an anomaly. Just prior to my block, I was working on the lede of our article on the 2008 Gaza war, which for some reason still bears a euphemistic title """"Israeli-Gazan conflict"""" or some such nonsense. The lede claimed that """"other Palestinian estimates differ"""" from the """"Hamas-run"""" Gazan hospital system; the only relevant article cited, a piece in the conservative """"home team"""" Israeli newspaper Jerusalem Post, actually noted a very close correlation between Ministry of Health estimates, endorsed by the World Health Organization, independent estimates, and even the Israeli estimate of overall fatalities (although IDF insists that the number of combatants was far greater, but only off the record and without specifics.) Two separate editors reverted my correction. I mean, how can we stand for this? Who the fuck cares about """"incivility"""" and """"personal attacks"""" when editors are lying about the content of sources and getting away with it? These people didn't read the sources. They didn't care about the sources. They just knew, because they wanted it to be true, that Palestinian casualty counts were all lies, so they edited the article to say so. I am sick of dealing with this kind of bullshit. What can I say, my patience is not unlimited.
I don't mean to make this out as if every editor who has a pro-Israel point of view is some kind of Satanic monster. I respect Steve/sm8900. I respect Avraham. I respect Ceedjee (and I still don't know where he stands except that he's downright mean to anybody who doesn't stand with him!) Hell, I even respect JayJG in my own twisted way, at least he's entertaining, if only in the fashion of a heel. But this endless stream of nonsense wears one down. I genuinely enjoy reasoned debate on talk pages, ok? But when people lie, cheat, dissemble, and filibuster, I'm going eventually to blow up. Deal with it.

(I note with irony my own advice to a newbie: Try and keep your cool, because WP seems to take an extremely hard line against """"incivility"""" from editors perceived as pro-Palestinian. They will always portray you as a crazy extremist, so it is best to support your arguments with solid """"mainstream"""" sources. [...] You have to be kind of single-minded, I think. Don't allow any opportunity for them to turn the discussion away from the real issues. Word your comments carefully so they cannot be twisted into some alternate interpretation to be used against you.

 Vandalism by 99.44.204.232. Please stop it  

Would 99.44.204.232 stop vandalising this article.  People have invested a lot of time and effort to improve this article  it doesn't help if you keep vandalising it.  In future if you have something positive to add to this article please discuss it in the talk page.  I have to spend hours undoing what you have just done.  Citing several sources (some of which are unreliable) about one particular issue which has already been addressed and sourced with notable sources is one thing, deleting edits with notable sources and then copying and pasting those sources to make a point is another.  You wanted the article to talk about Serer Nile Valley migration.  That had already been discussed several times with notable sources like Gravrand, Cheikh Anta Diop, etc.  You also wanted the ethnonym of Serer to reflect the thesis of Diop.  The article already did that with notable sources including Diop himself.  If only you took the time to read the whole article you would have realised that, all these had been addressed. However, you should also appreciate that not every scholar and certainly not the ultra traditionalist Serer who wants nothing to do with Egypt agree with Diop and in fact his thesis were rebutted by several scholars including Schuh, etc.  These are relevant view points which should also be taken into account in other to avoid bias.  

I will now respond to the """"sources"""" that you have provided.

Link 1: 
http://books.google.com/books?id=EZLF3T-5tlgC&pg;=PA706&lpg;=PA706&dq;=serer+wolof+north+east+africa&source;=bl&ots;=6ZlcoUiSsf&sig;=zOFR1CQY5BWf2thxHjWIhmq9Q8Y&hl;=en&ei;=BMFiToPpH6HL0QGE142OCg&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=6&ved;=0CEUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q;&f;=false

Have you realised that this source is not credible contrary to all the sources cited? Have you also realised that the author referred to the Kingdoms of Sine and Saloum as Wolof states?  Even the least verse on Senegambian history can easily find out for themselves that the Kingdom of Sine and Kingdom of Saloum were Serer Kingdoms not Wolof never mind a supposed scholar.   
Further, all the sources, historical and archaeological evidence shows that the Senegambian stone circles were built by the Serer people. (See: Gravrand, Pangool; Gamble, Salmon and Njie; Burke and Else; and F. Richard).

Since they were built by the Serers, and evidence have shown that they are built well before the 14th century, how then could the Serers have migrated into the area into the 14th century?  That doesn’t make sense.  Now the Serers may have migrated to from the Nile Valley as implied by Henri Gravrand in “La Civilisation Sereer, Pangool”, which is one of the sources cited in the article,  but as noted by Gravrand, if they did came from the Nile it was more than 5 thousand years ago and certainly not the 14th century. Further, as demonstrated by Gamble, Salmon and Njie, the Serer are the oldest inhabitants of Senegambia, others later moved in.  This backs up archealogical source, backs up Gravrand, Kleine, Richard  and so on.  
If your source was referring to the Guelwars of Kaabu coming from Kaabu to Sine in the 14th century at least I could understand that because it was at that time the Battle of Turubang (1335) occurred as stated by Sarr, Becker and others.  Even the Wolofs were already present long before the 14th century never mind the Serer people who have been present for thousand of years. Further as substantiated in the article with credible sources which all backs up each other, the Almoravid wars on Takrur due to religion (Islam) led to the Serers of Takrur who were finally defeated in Battle to leave Takrur and headed south.  That was in the 11th century during Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar and War Jabi.  Even those “Takrurien” Serers came south long before the 14th century to join their other Serer relatives (See Daggs).

e4d2675d114791f6,"""==fair enough==

its a fair point...... but why oh why did i do so much fulfilling all of the wikpedia guidlines for personal content , editting style , correct sourcing and referencing , wiki formatting etc .....months tireless work on an article which was to be so casually consigned to the dustbin.......

however much i respect your views, a redirect to the clairvoyance article  would however be entirely meaningless... one is not exchangeable for the other...  like cheese isn`t milk etc.....

covering the groundwork general background to establish a context for understanding extra sensory phenomena in general needed to be done  and it might as well happen at the Clairsentience page for now.....  

the reason i did it there was because fundamental doubts were being expressed about my earliest article`s conents were concerned implicitly announcing that the background for understanding extra sensory phenomena in general had not been done.... which was  ... as remember saying to you a few weeks ago   the frustrating context which motivated the writing of the second article with all of its references to the background research of brennan , lylle , mckenna , bohm , wilber , sheldrake   etc......because this background had to be established before any specifics about clairsentience could even be begun to be aproached  ....... thus the many weeks days and months of toil which has been endured to even get this background matereal into a wikpedia format and guidlines shape  ......  all of which criterea have been met  .... or at leasst  were until the finished product was mindlessly deleted...

the new additional altered states matereal  was a tentative beginning into finding a context for tentatively describing the specifics of the clairsentience phenomena itself...

but , agian it was trashed with no thought or care.... 

Redirect

I didn't redirect the article. What I said is that it probably should be. I'm happy that you're getting in there and editing and learning the ropes, but my personal opinion is that it should be redirected, and that is based on the idea that what's there is mostly about alternate states of consciousness and reality, and not really about the extrasensory clairsentience. I don't think there's enough published material to write an article just about clairsentience and that it should just be a subsection of ESP or another page. 90% of the clairsentience article was laying the groundwork for a state of reality where clairsentience could be real. That's fine, but it had very little had to do with clairsentience itself. The content about altered states of reality, etc. should probably go in an altered states of reality article instead of this particular article. I didn't, however, redirect it.

A math-wiki:

You are wrong about infinite representation. The ancient Greeks *never* represented 1/3 as 0.333... 

Now let me refute your argument regarding the transitive property:

A)    1=3(1/3)
B)    3(1/3) = 3(0.333...)
C)    3(0.333...) =0.999... 

The problem here occurs in B) where you assume that 3 * 0.333... = 3 * 1/3. You have 'not proved' anything. On the contrary, you have only proved that you are assuming 1/3 = 0.333... which it is obviously 'not equal'. 0.333... is an 'indeterminate' number because it cannot be represented finitely in base 10. 
0.333... is not equal to 1/3 so you cannot say that 1/3 is a finite representation. An indeterminate number is a number that is repeating in any
radix system.

You mention the division algorithm but do you know what it says? The division algorithm has 'nothing' to do with radix systems. Let me state it for you - If a and b are two given integers, there are unique integers q and r
such that a=bq + r and  0<= r < b. Now I will use the division algorithm to prove that you are WRONG once and for all. Suppose a = 1 and b = 0.999..., then 
what are the integers q and r such that the above is true?

Suppose that q = 0 and r = 1. Then the division algorithm fails because it makes a false statement i.e. q and r can both be 0 and 1 respectively.
For example: 1 = (0.999...)(1)+0 and 1 = (0.999...)(0)+1. So by default, the
division algorithm is proved false if 0.999... is equal to 1. And you can say a lot of things about the Greeks, but they would not make a stupid mistake like this. They were the smartest race in ancient times.

Now suppose that you try to tell me that either form is acceptable in the case of 0 and 1, you will still end up with a terrible contradiction:

1=(0.999...)(0)+1. The second form in this case implies that 1 < 0.999... since r < b. But how can 1 be less than 0.999... ??!!

We can all tailor hypotheticals to fit our arguments, but they are irrelevant, practical application is the real test. In regards to Islam, it is a vicious and wicked faith, and it is against all bounds of human logic, in Islam, a woman bearing her hair is haram, but her husband beating her up is halal, does this not defy human logic? """"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"""" is the oldest part of morality, it is a code to live by, if it is removed then simply in moral terms you can do what you like to people. Islam is a vicious and wicked faith, and Mo was a vicious and wicked man. I will keep on fighting against Islam.

Yes, the money quote is that I'm fucking pissed off at the insistence of Richard James continually harrassing me, refusing to stop identifying my personal info.

I have vandalized nothing but to take a letter or two off of my personal name and words that lead to my personal info. in the slanderous and libelous and defaming posts of richard james. I don't give a shit that my project is not listed here. I found the whole process interesting and hilarious, though quite hypocritical. WHo can take the piss out of who here. THe article was about an art project, not me. I don't care that it's not there. It doesn't exist, nor does Bigfoot! His compromise was on day two of the original posting of the project article, a one man band who decides fist down who gets what and when, like a fascist pig. I could have campaigned for votes, but what the fuck...Before final vote and deletion, Richard James posted an article about me without my desire nor consent, and then deleted it in a violent fit of rage when I jokingly said the first article is dead at another's insistence that it should be deleted then at seven days. He's had the same hard-on ever since. As I said, I don't give a shit but that his posts are defaming, slanderous, libelous and outright insidious. His high and mighty accusational tone is what is weird and strange. All I have done in the past two days is to delete letters of my name and project, and the old username that I was attempting to expunge. Why?

Again, you disgusting cretin, you accuse my statements of being laughable, yet have no logical basis to believe so. You think I believe my arguments are gospel, eh? So you're the kind of person who believes that if everybody believes something, then you should go along with them? So you're the kind of sick bastard that would've condoned slavery just because everybody you knew did? I do not at all think my arguments are gospel, I just proudly stand by my word until a logical argument will present a sensical contradiction. You're the bastard who has some sort of personal agenda attatched to this and for some reason or another, you refuse to have it changed, like a no-good dirty hippocrite.

Dude, sorry for the rough language, but you are one fucking dumbass idiot. Everything I type is extremely intelligible and free-flowing, if you will, yet you seem to interpret it WAY differently than it is obviously stated. My sentence, """"You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so"""", makes perfect sense and only an idiot would not understand it. I wrote it redundantly to prove a point, not because I lack verbal skills. The point being, that you are an idiot and you can't understand the symbolic (or even literal) nature of my posts, and you interpret it into something that somehow benefits you and your cozy little world view. Ok, this will be the 100TH time I've had to clear something up for you, but let me tell you what this sentence means:

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

If you discerned something other than this, than you are retarded, hands down. I can't understand why you make all these radical interpretations, especially when most of my words are plainly visible. I am in NO WAY contradicting myself here, and if you can't understand this, then I am in NO WAY going to argue with the mentally retarded, for the guilt would prevent me from having peace of mind for quite some time.

About the Standard English, obviously, this article was written by a British person, and is extremely POV, thus is not a valid argument against this issue. That's like basing all your knowledge about drugs on government and anti-drug propaganda. 

Please man, let's put some sense into this argument, and remove all the non-sensical bullcrap you've included into. And don't ever, EVEr fucking tell me to go away, got it?

 Unwarranted remarks 
hello.  First of all, I'm very well aware of """"3RR"""", and secondly, you should be aware that I did NOT reach """"3RR"""" or violate anything.  Thirdly, it would be nice (for consistency's sake, but since I see favoritism and politics at work here) that you would give that same lecture to Malik.  Since he was reverting like crazy and getting close to uh """"3RR"""".  Of course you didn't, per your bias in favor of him, for some reason (a problem on Wikipedia that happens with Admins and other users...), and sided with his nonsense that somehow """"ICGC"""" was somehow """"not notable"""".  Never mind that they've been all over tv talk shows for years, guests on interviews, and in the radio, and even in the news.  Never mind that they've been around for decades.  And have internet sites for years.  You'll knee-jerkly take Malik's side on this, because after all, he's """"Malik Shabaz"""".  A bully on Wikipedia who is revert happy, and for some reason you favor.  I do NOT appreciate your remarks to me on his talk page.   I did not violate anything. NOTHING.  But Malik was arguably violating """"I don't like"""" and """"no own"""".  You'll deny that, because after all, he's Malik.  And for whatever reason, whatever he does or says, you (admin or not), seem to knee-jerkly side with.  So now that Malik has obvious back-up for his bullying and ownership violations (back-up from an imperfect Admin who is arguably a bully too doesn't bode well for me, does it) it's hard for me to do anything.  Yes, I'm angry.  Your remarks were obtuse and unnecessary.  I violated nothing.  Malik seems to think he owns a bunch of articles, as is seen from his history and pattern.  Yet you wink at it, or deny that, because, well, he's """"Malik"""".  Good day.   """,1,0,0,0,0,0

Notes for the blind communist Castro lovers editing wikipedia and for the man himself

There seems to be a group of people around here in wikipedia with very strong leftist tendency that are very blind as to no recognize Castro for what he is. But not to worry. History will take care of him like it took care of Hitler and Stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer.
There is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here. All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. 
Castro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. 
You could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! 
But you want to know something. You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution. You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power. 
You claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world. 

""""Right""""!How many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands? How many desperate people abandon the  island? Because there is no other choice? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime, controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia. Cleaning up your image! 
It amazes me. Because this goes to show what you are. A megalomaniac! too worry about what history will tell about you, about what your legacy will be.
Do not worry Fidel Castro. I will let you know this. Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti, Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar. 
You do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles.  
You must be full of envy about Chavez! because his got the oil money you never had! and because of it he can buy some people. But do not be! Some people are not for sale. Some people will not buy the lies you sell.
This is for you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Che's level, yes the same one you made a martyr, an icon of the revolution, Your first patron saint. The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! 
That is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, 
he(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit.

Ask yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba?

Many people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones. Poor guys, I am sorry for them. 
 
Castro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants. But no more.. Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later. Do not worry, when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone. Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry. Cuba will be rebuild. All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane. You know why that will be? Because, Cubans will have learn their lesson. 

For you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution. How power have corrupted him and his regime. How many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution? how much intolerance! how many times he has sell out his """"principles"""".

Notice how silent the Great Mathematician Dr. Hillman is in the light of Nobel Prize physicist Brian Josephson's remark above putting him in his proper place and in Hillman's inability to respond to Sarfatti's detailed argument above. It is not enough to bluster """"it's nonsense"""". Burinski will also respond he is not on e-mail all the time. None of your facts check out. Everything Sarfatti has said is the truth and his arguments on the physics have not been refuted. You people not only have no respect for truth, you simply cannot even perceive it because this information is too advanced for all of you - even Chris Hillman who is not a physicist although he is a mathematician of sorts - he admits he is not even interested in quantum theory so he should recuse himself if he were really honest.

 3RR warning 

Three times today (28 Oct.) you have reverted the """"sinusoids"""" language to your preferred """"trigonometric functions"""" language, as I've tried various things to explain, reference, talk about it, etc.  Please engage rather than just reverting.  If you revert again, I'll report you for 3RR violation again.  

Neither you nor I are experts in the article subject matter (least squares spectral analysis). But I cited 2 references that literally say """"trigonometric functions"""", while your references all refer to another method (Fourier analysis) you freely interpret as to make it sound they refer to the article subject matter, though it is obvious they do not (in your mind, as you claimed it explicitly, Fourier analysis is still the same as least-squares spectral analysis, which is obviously a nonsense because WP has two completely separate articles both featured on WP main page btw).  So I do not believe anyone any more will buy your misusing of Wikipedia regulations. There is no reversals here, not even technically speaking; because what is going on is mine (article author’s) cleaning of all the shit you keep spraying around. Just like so many editors noted (everyone just look at Dicklyon’s talk page) that you engaged in edit wars or insults exchanges with so far. You are just a trouble maker around here and everyone sees you as such. Now stuff your imaginative misinterpretations of WP regulations to where they belong.  No 3RR violation on my part. But I know why you just threatened with reporting me: it is because I already mentioned to you today that you are in violation of 3RR yourself.

After all the countless times you escaped at the very last moment, finally, I, Butros The Mighty, have defeated you, Crum375, Space Commander From Swalwell! 
How long I have awaited this glorious triumph! The Emperor Of The Universe has secured his dominion on this day! And now that my long struggle is over, how about a little... amusement?
With a clap of my jewel-bedecked hands, I summon the scantily clad dancing girls of my Pan-Galactic Slave-Harem. 
I have destroyed your accursed vessel, Star Of Abuse III, and melted it into slag, from which the galaxy's greatest artisans have forged a grand, towering statue... of me! A statue even larger and grander than the one you toppled, pinning me under its plinth, the day you nearly destroyed my Throne Room! The statue stands here in the Grand Ballroom of my Great Celestial Palace, covered in a gigantic space-tarp, but not so fast, Crum, we are not yet ready for the grand unveiling. 
I have captured the traitorous Princess Angela and her rebel allies from the Spaceship Tax Evader and immobilized them in geo-stationary orbit above my palace. At the merest touch of a button, I can activate the Astro-Detonator and delight the assembled billions here with a fireworks display the likes of which the great Butronian Empire has never seen! Princess Angela may be my own daughter, but that will not stop me from turning her and her fellow Wiki-lovers into space-dust. Even now, helplessly strapped into titanium space-manacles, they witness all I say and do on the Projecto-Screen of the Gallant. Hello, my fair daughter. How does it feel to lay eyes once again on your own... DOOM?
Ha ha ha ha ha!
See how I have seized your puny Earth friends, your boob-lover helper Guy Chapman and boy sidekick Jayjg? They too shall be forced to look on as I gorge in ecstasy at your failure and destroy your planet! Even now, I can see they long for me to discharge the Fang-Creatures of Carnivoron into their glass-walled prison, thus releasing them from the agony of witnessing my victory... But no! First, they will watch you writhe in defeat!
And that is not all, Crum! Surely, even slung in your titanium chains above the Flames Of Hate, you can see that to my right I have, held at Blasto-Ray-point by my Robo-Legionnaires, bound and displayed for all to see... Jimbo Wales and his Rocket Squad! Repturova, the Talurnian walking-lizard spy who betrayed me by joining you! Weissus, commander of the Valkyrie War-Jet Platoon! And last but not least... your beloved Julian Van August!
And now, with the merest wave of my Hypno-Scepter... Watch as your darling Earth friend tumbles under my spell. DANCE! Dance for my amusement! Let the sight of your seductively writhing body, contorting itself for my viewing pleasure, be the last thing Crum sees before she is lowered into the Flames! 
Tears?! Do I see tears in the eyes of the brave Crum375, also kown as Linda Mack? Oh-ho! Even I, in my most sinister, depraved dreams, would never have imagined it!
DANCE FOR MY AMUSEMENT! NEH-HEH heh-heh-heh-heh! HA HAHAHAHA!
How glorious! At last, with trumpet fanfare from my Astro-Orchestra, I order the curtain raised from my statue and...WHAT?!! ... It's a newly rebuilt Star Of Abuse IV! And who is that emerging from the gangplank? Crum, herelf?! 
NO! 
Buddy Jayjg has activated a hidden radio signal! The Rocket Squad is bursting free and shrinking my Robo-Legionnaires into nothing with Transmut-O-Bracelets concealed in their manacles! Weissus swings his mighty Space-Mace, smashing the controls to my torturous devices! My Hypno-Scepter, forced from my grasp by Prince Kazak's Magneto-Shooto-Beam! Julian Van August, running free into the awaiting arms of... CRUM?
Then, who is the prisoner suspended above the Flames Of Hate? What? Emitting the telltale sparks and ear-smoke of an android double? Drat! It's nothing more than a simple robo-mannequin decoy! 
Aiyeee! The Spaceship Gallant, with Princess Angela at the helm, is dive-bombing the Great Celestial Palace! Billowing clouds of space-smoke! Crowds running everywhere! Kaff! I'm choking! Kaff, kaff! Victory has—kaff—slipped through my fingers—kaff, kaff!—once again! Kaff, kaff!—CURSE YOU, CRUM kaff 375! Kaff! CURSE kaff YOU kaff FOREVER! Kaff, kaff, kaff, kaff...

 Dear soldier of the Wikipedia neo-nazi/communist dictatorship 
What the hell are you tlaking about. I did not re-creat any article about the formal Australian Worker's Party formaly known as the New Communist Party of Australia. I think you are high on the lies told by storm front. You the hell listens to storm front. Oh my god Wikipedia is becomeing a dumping ground for neo-nazis and altra lefties. Since I am the voice of reason. I just have to say one thing. Pleas read my reply to storm front. Here it is - Okay okay. Lats just get the fatcs right. This is what some nazi said on storm front
"""" Peter Watson (of Warwick, Qld.) has claimed to represent all sorts of groups, and - in forums - likes to pretend he is several people at the same time. He has a habit of claiming to be the President of organisations he has made up on the internet. He says he is 14 (or 16) years old.""""

Answere:- No I have not supported lotsd of groups. I have only supported the CPW , AWP (formally known as the NCPA). I was never a member of the People's Think Tank Association plus the PTTA never had a president. Plus I have only ever been one person. And that person is Peter Watson. This nazi must have a lot of time on his hands to look for information on me. So I can only come up with only one conclusion and that is simply that this man has no social or sex life. So I can only say on thing """"go get a life man and get a women"""".

Peter was President of the """"People's Think Tank Association"""" based in Warwick, which he says """"split from the Communist Party of Australia just recently and they publish the Caller""""

Answere:- I was never the president of the PTTA. The PTTA was never ever created. The Caller was a fake news paper. As fare as I know it was only ever printed once by some nazi. Since the PTTA was never realy so how cna it split from the CPA. So many questions and not enough answeres. The man just doesn't have a life.

Peter was """"President of the New Communist Party of Australia"""" and """"Chairman of the Central Committee"""" (this is in his Communist International News)

Answere:- I was the president but not the had of the NCPA. I was the chairman of the central commitee. But as you might know the NCPA and the AWP are the same group. The AWP change its name to NCPA but change it's name back soon after remember you stupid nazi.

Peter was """"President of the Communist Party of Warwick""""

Answere:- Only for a short number of times in the hsitory fot he party that I was the presidnet of it.

Peter also says: """"the New Communist Party of Australia (NCPA) , The People Think Tank Association (PTTA) and the Communist Socialist Workers Front (CSWF) did dissolve and absorbed into the Australia First Party (AFP)"""".

Answere:- The Communist Socialist Worker's Front never ever was created and never was real. It just goes to show that nazis just makes things up to help them selvs. The PTTA was never real. If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun.

Peter has also set up the """"Australian Worker's Party""""

Answere:- This nazi (FairDinkum) is a idiot. I have said this many times that it was started in april was a split from the CPW that changed it's name to NCPA than change it's name back to AWP when it was kicked out fo the AFP. Not only are nazis stupid like FairDinkum but they also don't listen.

I am a Communist and believe in Marxist-Leninism. I am not retarted. Plus I am not troubled person or retarted. I have never said in my life that I was the king of the Communists or the Nazis.

Sunday Times

""""Brilliantly researched and argued ... a magisterial work of history ... Kosovo will inevitably be received immediately as an immensely valuable contribution to our understanding and knowledge of a contemporary crisis.

In this awe-inspiring work, Malcolm has created a vital successor to his Bosnia: A Short History and an essential aid to anyone who wishes to understand this tragic region today...His book is exceptional not only for his unimpeachable rearch, but also for his equitable examination of the conflicting ethnic views of what really happened ...

There you have it. Noel Malcolm is revered and aknowledged as a neutral and impartial historian. But just because he isn't on of your Serbo-bloggers, you come up with all this shit about his works. When he says """"conquered"""", that is exactly what the term means. Your map is shit. Because Serbs ONLY MADE UP 25% of that land whether it was a bigger or smaller Kosova than today. And I call it KOSOVA because KOSOVA is it's name. It's Serbo-nationalists like you, Dab, and Balkanfever who keep it in it's Milosevic devized name. And you keep going on about the Treaty in London 1913. Well???? What happened???? Certainly nothing to do with Kosova joining Serbia because I said before and I'll say again - if it did, Malcolm would have said it. If he gets things wrong, why is he so well respected by all those reporters in the newspapers listed by Interestedinfairness. Answer that one. Dab, don't confuse the issue. It doesn't matter if Kosova was once it Italy, I tell you that it has never been in Serbia, it only had the bad luck to be in the same """"genocide state"""" as Serbia when a part of Yugoslavia.

In my own defense: A man has a right to his opinion. I do feel Timothy Usher is a bigot. I do feel that Jews are screwing up the planet (though admittedly Muslims, by far, surpass the Jews in their capacity to destroy things). Look at history. Only recently has it become the norm to like Jews. That only came about after certain countries (eg America) adopted them as the collective dame-in-distress needing shelter and protection. Sort of the precursor to the chihuahua. Before then, Jews were hated in Europe and America alike..And everywhere else. We all know Jews were once banished from most culturally superior European countries. The only reason why Poland took them in was that they had loads of money. Probably the same reason why Washington panders to the now. Point is, alot of people dislike Jews. I'm entitled to, so long as I don't demonstrate that dislike on articles dealing with the topic of Jews. We don't penalize people for not liking things, do we? His Excellency...

Just how many sticks of dynamite would need to go off inside your thick head before you get it? Trying to dismiss the WBO is piss weak. It's been on par with the other 3 for years. Check the record of wbo champions in unification fights.

This is the last time I'm explaining it, so read carefully. When Jones-Johnson happened there was ALREADY an undisputed linear champion - Michalczewski. Jones & Johnson's belts meant NOTHING....PAPER titles. As well as being linear champion, Michalczewski & was the RIGHTFUL HOLDER of the WBA/IBF belts anyways. He never lost them in the ring. He was stripped under bogus politics. Your sources are still SHIT. You haven't heard of any of the sources I posted because you're a noob whos only knowledge is from hbo & The Ring, who have ZERO credibility on this issue.

Jones had only won a """"vacant interim"""" wbc belt, champion Tiozzo relinquished the wbc belt, Jones was declared wbc holder then relinquished it. Rocchigiani won it then Jones decides he wants it back so the wbc illegally stripped Rocchigiani. Michalczewski then defeated the rightful holder.

Re-read the fucking link;

http://www.boxrec.com/media/index.php?title=Fight:12432

My main source is the Linear championship policy which goes back over 100 years. A policy you, being so dumb, don't even understand. HBO are a joke....whenever Jones faced his hand picked opponents defending his bogus belts on their broadcasts, hbo would even mention the legit champion - Michalczewski.""",1,0,0,0,0,0

 MY STATEMENT 

AND WHAT IS IT I DID EXACTLY TO BE BANNED?
WILL SOMEBODY PLEASE EXPLAIN?
You are obviously not aware of what is goinf ´g on I am ban for not contributing at all with the talk page!! what ? I am the one who asked for this mediation for more than 2 weeks ago and it was for something else than that and this snowskinner who was asked to bring the arbitration knows it perfectly. And i am the one working out ot bring the two best cosmolog in the world to look at those thesis, ans I am the one who did contributed the most in this affair together with Igor Bogdanov, at the refute of those falsifications of evidencies presented here by ybm and his acolytes.
I was ban because ybm had been ban and couldn't stand it.
But where he was ban 24 hours for insulting repaeatridly people and calling Igor Bogdanov a bastard 3 times and for having on several occassions oversteped the 3RR rule, I was ban 3 x 24 hours for having presented an article who was evaluated by Bidhonene who is a very endeared friend of YBM, for not being so usefull as she wish.
An article containing of course a serie of evidenscies who didn't have been shown before, and who constiture a major block against the conspiratorial arguments of ybm and his gang.
Just as she did it here on my talk page when she deleeted it all, and vnever reinserted it, a precious document proving the ´factual connection between YBM and this Voyer who infatuated this whole affair.
It was YBM who had invited his friend on my talkpage, until he realized that i had an arbitration going on that was about this.
Bishonen blocked me 20 minutes after her protegé had been blocked.
i dont see any of her interventions in this talk page concerning the insults of rjb and ybm, nor concerning their cynical and very empty and longs comments about my mediation on the talk page tonight.
You can read my articles yourself and see how hard I was fighting to make sure that the situation will not degenerate further, and to calm down the spirit.
She didn't make an intervention there to ask rjb and ybm to stop their acction and provocating attitudes, nor accused them for saying nothing nor removed their articles for not improving the talk page, nor contributing with anything on it.
She has already been told to don't interfeer anymore on this talk page because she is unable to differentiate between  her liking and her work as an admi.
She does not follow the rules and do a very destructiv work, using retaliation and arbitrarious judgement all the time, and always something who arranged ybm very much.
She even do revert for him and use her status to commit illegitimate stuff.
The arbitration should have been about this too.
They are using the fact that mediator Nicholas turnbull is out for a week to do their bad deeds.
And this snowsnippers know that what he does is out of hand, and that he should never have done it.
He even insulted Nicholas turnbull.
Easy when people aren't there to defend themselves.
Wiki english is a spot on the face of Wikipédia, admi are behaving like sabotors and vandaliser and encourage riot, and abuse of their knoledge and power to undermine actions made to refrein their wrong doing.

This has to stop.
I asked for a mediation and an arbitration comity for more than two weeks and Sowspinners actions are completely unlegitimate.
He has stollen MY mediation and MY arbitration request.
This don't go and has to be aborted.
I do not recognise the actual arbitration for being legitimate, and thereby ask all to boycot it.

None of the involved administrator can in anyway be part of the arbitration comity or of the arbitration.
It is a close debate and not an arena game.
THis arbitration was supposed to be hold secret, as snowspinner knows very well, and took some very unlucky initiatives from the very beginning.
He is an idiot to have done that, and has no sens of responsability, nor of maturity, and cannot be trusted.
He must be removed as well.
i dont accept what happened tonight. There was absolutly no reasons for me to be blocked and certainly not for 3 days.
If I say fuck! like ybm nothing happen, but if I bring precious evidencies, so I am ban and the evidencies confiscated and destroy yes, and detroyed as they have been alredy here several times.
This is the sign of a totalitarian system, and wiki english has became a totalitarian system, where the judged perform the judgement, and were all proofs are stollen and destroyed and were disturbing people are threaten for their meaning and impert to say more, and blocked away.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Citations_missing#Inline_citations_are_not_required_by_policy

1. Inline citations are not required by policy

No policy requires inline citations. They are often a good idea, and are a requirement for feature article status, but it is not a requirement for all articles. Furthermore, the tag is often used when the article has adequate sources. This tag therefore enshrines a particular editor's view about style (that the article in question should have inline citations) in an inappropriate way. That point belongs on the talk page, not in the article itself. Robert A.West (Talk) 

    Where does it say that featured articles have different requirements then other articles? Jeepday 

        The whole point in to get citations for all articles so that they meet the WP:V requirements, I have noticed that tags quite often help by bringing this to attention of users, particularly new-ish users. Cheers SeanMack 

            I agree with Jeepday and SeanMack. Our ultimate goal should be for every article to be of FA quality.  Satori Son 

                That goal is not consensus among editors. But more importantly, inline citations for every fact are not an FA requirement; see WP:FA? section 1c. CMummert · talk

The Bakersfield Californian ^ | Feb 21 2007 | LEONEL MARTINEZ My catechism teacher, Sister Mary Lou Petrillo, was a smart and scrappy nun who drilled into us the basics of Catholicism without demeaning other Christian churches or religions. Too bad Sister Mary Lou isn't available to teach a few intensive lessons on tolerance to the campaign people of presidential candidate John Edwards. Within the last few weeks, two bloggers for the former North Carolina senator resigned after being hit with criticism from conservative Catholic organizations angered by past anti-Catholic remarks the bloggers posted on the Web, according to CNN. Melissa McEwan and Amanda Marcotte quit after groups like the Catholic...

Suprisingly - or not - at least one individual whose statements are featured in that archive ( and also in collections of antisemitic rhetoric ) is also leader of a prominent Christian right group that claims to fight against anti-Catholic bias and discrimination who...

So they made it about VNam and thanks to our BRAVE HONEST HEROIC Swift Boat Vets for Truth, it was! LOL! (With additional props to Dan Rather.)

- In 2006, the dems and their liberal enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Iraq figuring it gave Dems an edge.

- And thanks to Senator John Kerry, the Dan Rather of 2006, this year's election is about Iraq.

- And no, saying it was 'joke' just won't cut it.

- This latest Kerry outrage totally fits the LONGSTANDING pattern of Dems hating and denigrating our troops. From Kerry's GI Joe outfit testimony before Congress in 1971 to Dennis Kucinich, to Howard Dean to a San Francisco (where Nancy Pelosi is from) supervisor saying we should SHUT DOWN our military, the antipathy is indelible.

Sir,

It has come to my attention that despite taking advantage of our first-rate American education facilities, you insist upon identifying as a Bangladeshi.

My parents are/were Bangladeshis, and they were amongst the most wretched people I have ever had the misfortune of knowing; Indeed, during this unfortunate period of my life that I have been forced to spend in Bangladesh due to my father, I am now convinced that Bangladesh is the single most unworthy nation to exist. (I use are/were because, I regret to say, my mother was struck dead by Bangladesh - and despite her dysfunctional state and pathological lying, I mourn her loss greatly.)

Never have I felt more love for my country than now, when I find myself forced away from it! I have now given my loyalty, heart and soul, to the United States of America: The greatest country in the world, God bless every inch of it.

But after my experiences with Bangladeshis, I cannot allow for one such as yourself to leech off of the United States while offering nothing in return. I implore you to either renounce Bangladesh and enjoy the remainder of your life in the blessed free world, or get the fuck out of my country, you filthy ape.

Sincerely yours,

A proud AMERICAN",1,0,0,0,0,0

I also think it is mere rubbish but I also think it is not completely rubbish. According to the southeast asian history, most of the ancient rulers of this region are Hindus, some rulers came from Persia (map covered Middle east, Greece, west India - Achaemenid Empire, Seleucid Empire, Parthian Empire and Sassanid Dynasty, please look at the size of the map their conquered). Kedah is a good example where the king from Persia came and eventually he built a kingdom.

In the old days, it was slavery society (no sultanate and no democracy yet), all Hindu rulers belong to higher class, common peoples and the natives belong to inferior slave class. The Hindus rulers came from India and Persia and they ruled most of the southeast asia, they called themselves high class peoples, the rest are merely slaves. Parameswara is a Hindu ruler, he is one of the descendants of the Hindu royal family that belong to higher class of Hinduism.

As for the Macedonian bloodline, this is also not completely rubbish. In the old days, the Persian empire was so big, they are so proud with king Alexander the Great. Also, they ruled some of the southeast asian lands such as the Angkor, Pasai, etc. Parameswara later married Pasai's princess and adopted Persian Shah and claimed as descendant of Alexander the Great, I don't think all this is completely rubbish.

Anyway, please correct me, I may be wrong too.

Killer, I'm sorry that you have misread my unblock request. If you re-read it you will see that my use of """"pop-eyed chihuahua"""" there refers specifically, accurately and unequivocally to the dog displayed on your user page and not to you. I cited it to explain to why I used that imagery in the WP:PA, as otherwise it would appear inexplicably random. The explanation was not, as you seem to think, offered in mitigation. Indeed my original unblock request, which I condensed at the request of admin Hersfold, stated: 

The following will help the reviewing admin(s) to understand what otherwise would appear to be a random choice of metaphors.[...] Killer has a picture of a pop-eyed chihuahua dog on her user page,  captioned “I look like this”; and she is in the habit of referring to herself, in her sysopping summaries, as a dog   e.g. “Puppy has spoken.” Stupidly I exploited this canine imagery at Killer’s expense.'' 

I edited out that section along with others in an effort to comply with Hersfold's request.

My unblock request in no way implies that it is 'somehow OK to insult' you because you refer to yourself as 'puppy'. It simply explains where the idea for the canine imagery came from. It does not attempt to excuse my using it to insult you.

Ever thought about """"Soviet Jews"""" phenomenum?

Real Russian people were killed only as """"rivals"""", because of _war_ and not the _holocaust_!

P.S. For homosexuals killing, mentioned above - I would have killed them all if had a chance! Really, killing homosexuals is not a sin, according to Bible. AND, homosexuality was widely spread in 20'th century Germany, so i doubt they were really persecuted... Hitler stated himself that that were Jews', who dont'let Germany win the First War, and all other casaulties were mostly accidental... And, of course Soviets, who protected their counry agains the invaders were regular victims of WAR, not the HOLOCAUST itself.

ikipedia Founder Hit With Relationship Trouble, Allegations of Excessive Spending
By Megan McCarthy March 03, 2008 | 3:34:58 PMCategories: People  
Wikipedia founder Jimmy Wales didn't have such a good weekend. First the blogosphere and then Wikipedia itself lit up with news of his messy breakup with controversial Canadian TV pundit Rachel Marsden. Now, accusations are flying that Wales has been living the high life on the expense account of the nonprofit foundation he created.
On Friday, reports surfaced that the married-but-divorcing Internet icon carried on a clandestine affair with Marsden.  Evidence of the affair included lurid IM transcripts, which appeared on Silicon Valley gossip blog Valleywag. On Saturday, Wales posted a statement on the Wikipedia Foundations website (which he later moved to his personal site) denying that his actions went against Wikimedia Foundation's policies, and stating that the affair had ended. Marsden responded by listing the clothes that he left at her house up for auction on eBay.
So, what's the big deal when a relationship goes sour? Well, the two met when Marsden contacted Wales to help her """"clean up"""" what she perceived to be errors on her personal Wikipedia page, and there have been allegations that Wales used his influence to improperly make changes.
Former associates of Wales' are using this scandal to bring up other worries they have about the organization of the foundation. Former Wikimedia exec Danny Wool, who left the foundation last year, wrote a blog post insinuating that Wales used the non-profit foundation as his own personal piggy bank. Expenses that Wales tried to apply to the foundation included $300+ bottles of wine and visits to Moscow massage parlors, Wool alleges. According to Wool, the expenses got so out of hand that the Wikimedia foundation took away Wales' corporate credit card.
""""There were occasions where he used [the Wikimedia Foundation] for personal advancement under the guide of the mission.  And, as someone who was in there for the mission part of it, I found that rather distressful,"""" Wool told EPICENTER.
Wales did not immediately respond to a request for comment.""",0,0,1,0,0,0

That was really mean. Family Guy and King of the Hill are good shows, but so is KP. Don’t get hostile. =D  
One of the things that make the show unique is that it is a comedy aimed at more than just kids, that doesn't revolve around a cliched 'loser' main character. In fact KP is the complete antithesis of a loser and so are her family and most of her friends. Even Ron doesn't really fit the stereotype. Both FG and KOTH can be funny but there comes a point when you want a break from all those cynical shows that are all about laughing at someone's ignorance and stupidity.  
Hey wait a second. Totally Spies sucks. Kim Possible was good, but later jumped the shark. it then became the worst show ever (well, not as bad as totally spies or futurama, but got close). Also, as for another comment above, Teenage Robot  was AWFUL. Robot Jones was way better. And as for the final one, King of the Hill was great, but Family Guy is unfunny.

GraemeL,

I was wondering if your edits are like a form of literary masturbation for you? I'm curious, have you had any success in your lifetime? I can on imagine a jealous perpetually failing loser could possibly be so particularly concerned with what rational people would agree is legitimate content simply because you are affraid of any association whatsoever with commercialism. Are you jealous, envious, or affraid of people who succeed? Maybe you'd be best to give up your life as a failure and join a commune, where you can spend your days feeling as equaly imcompeted as your fellow unsuccessful losers. At your commune, no one is superior and no one enjoys more success than others, therefore you don't have to feel ashamed of your lack of accomplishment. Do your edits make you feel important? Does your mommy or boyfriend control your life so much that you're only able to feel satisfaction in your life through the edits you demand? Enjoy yourself, Graemel. I'm sure you'll keep up your crusade like the predictible loser I know you must be. I'm going to stop further wasting my time with Wikipedia and go continue what I do best - which is to make money.

2. You have complained with a fellow administrator in order to get me blocked. Because already several lies from your side have been proven beyond doubt, this does not surprise me at all.
3. People that reverted were mainly Irishpunktom and you, both known for their pro-islamic POV and regularly cooperating in edit warring (also regarding several other articles, such as Apostacy and dhimmi, for instance, in order to press pro-islamic POV. All this indicates a coordinated campaign in order to press Islamist viewpoints.
4. Prove it. The fact is, I have sources, you don't even try to source your POV OR and take resort to weasel wording instead. I will force you to source your statement in my next edit.

[Verse 1]
Konnichiwa, senpai
Please notice me
I watch Asian cartoons
I'm a weeaboo

I live in my mom's house
I'm like 32
I collect swords and throwing stars
'Cause I'm a weeaboo

Sticks and stones may break my bones
But I will always be one step ahead of you
Because I read the manga
(You're such a fucking pleb, are you even even Japanese bro?)

I haven't showered in like 16 weeks
All my friends and peers are ashamed of me
'Cause all of a sudden
I think I'm Japanese

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm a weeaboo (x4)
A filthy weeaboo
(Naruto's so overrated)
A dirty weeaboo
(You wanna see my katana collection?)
A fucking weeaboo
(I'm learning Japanese on Rosetta Stone)
A disgusting weeaboo
(So I'm like basically Japanese now)

[Verse 2]
I sit at my computer desk
And argue with teenagers on the internet
About atheism
And how Japan is superior to other countries
I learned a bit of Japanese
So now i'm qualified to be a part of their community
So i made my avatar a kawaii waifu

[Chorus]
Yes, I'm a weeaboo
(Uh duh, everybody wears kimonos)
Yes, I'm a weeaboo
(Ninjas are still real, okay?)
Yes, I'm a weeaboo
(Uh, k-konnichiwa)
Yes, I'm a weeaboo
(Domo arigato)
A filthy weeaboo
(...)
A dirty weeaboo
A fucking weeaboo

 I have to put this as sittign here cackling my head off.  Are you peopel on leave from a psyche hospital?  I just found the following post from prissy Dame Ewart on some other user's talk page.

Its all very weird.  This Gretaw is not me.  It seems she also is offended by Dame Sara so good on her.  Fancy this Sarah going to anothers talk page and speakign to them as though they are someone else.  That is so wacko.  Shows how you guys are.  Very delusional.

Its a delicious honour to be blocked from you feral ninnys.  TY for the compliment.  I just edit on Help.com but really, what a waste of time editing anywhere, especially when no one pays for the effort.

Ensure Dame Sarah reads this below the obvious delusional it is.  No one presumes to that extent unless the need some help.

Why would I register an accoutn when I wont even sign posts, (too much IT nous for that whereas the rest of u dont it seems).

2.Wikipedia guidelines dictate that you assume good faith in dealing with other editors. Please stop being uncivil to your fellow editors, and assume that they are here to improve Wikipedia. Thank you.  Bidgee  
[edit] Gundagai
Ms Gundagai, normally I would be thrilled to be the centre of so much attention (so far all your edits, except those to your userpage, have been devoted to me), but article talk pages are for discussing the article, not for making personal attacks on other users. If you wish to give me feedback, I would be most interested to read it. The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.
If you truly object to editors """"fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,"""" then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you. Every time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people. At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.""""
I strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.
I am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf. So thankyou for that. I hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. Sarah Ewart (Talk) """"""",1,0,0,0,0,0
