 RE: Metamodernism 

The large portions I cut had all failed to meet WP:RS as the only citations cited were personal blogs (a few of which were just default-wordpress-theme, abandoned over a year ago kind of blogs). It seems as though the page in question is being maintained by the owners of metamodernism.com, which was (and may still be) the most cited source on the page (which, once more, in no way passes WP:RS), thus provokes other issues with WP:NOTADVERTISING, WP:COI, etc. _friend """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Challenged content

The following material has been challenged by two separate IP editors, and restored by one editor (Altenmann). Having reviewed it, it does not appear to be in an encyclopedic style and requires a rewrite. As such, I've posted it here for discussion and reworking to avoid disruption. The text in dispute is as follows:

Pincus offers managerial advice on handling difficulties caused by both types: she defines the know-it-all as the """"Truly Smart Know-It-All"""", an employee with """"a intellectual handle on the job requirements that is spectacular"""", but who """"doesn't 'see' boundaries"""", and the omniscient deity as a person who """"thinks nothing of imposing or intruding"""". Lloyd makes no such distinction, although he notes that ironically, Know-It-Alls can sometimes know what they are talking about, and simply have such a brusque style of communication that people are unwilling to listen. He characterizes Know-It-Alls as superficially domineering and controlling, but insecure underneath. The outward focus on the inferiority of their fellows is intended to mask the inner sense of their own weaknesses in knowledge, skills, and competence.
 
Pincus recommends different strategies for each type. For the case of the Truly Smart Know-It-All she observes that a manager might have to bend the rules somewhat to accommodate the negative aspects of such an employee, which include impatience, an exaggerated sense of self-importance, and other peculiarities, in order to retain the positive benefits of the employee's knowledge and experience. Although she also cautions that managers have to weigh the benefits against the taxing effects, upon managers and staff, of employing an """"outlandish prima donna"""". She also recommends that rule-bending not extend to allowing the peculiarities of a true know-it-all with odd habits to be displayed to outsiders, such as customers and other visitors, and that such employees be clearly requested not to flout their eccentricities when such visitors call. She also states that managers should not be afraid of asking a genius employee questions, and should insist upon mutual respect and not adopt a self-deprecating attitude simply in order to placate such employees. Lloyd similarly advises managers to take a strong line against any form of intellectual bullying, either of others or indeed of the manager.
 
For the Know-It-All who doesn't, Pincus recommends to managers that they give praise where it is due, and that they assign such employees to work together with one, or two, other people, and regularly check for signs of stress. Notess observes that the last tactic mentioned can be unsuccessful if a Know-It-All is paired with a novice, since the Know-It-All quickly takes control away from the novice.
 
LLoyd observes that getting a point across to a Know-It-All can sometimes be difficult, and require much repetition, because such people are more interested in what they themselves are saying than in listening to others.

Please post suggestions for rewrites below; if we cannot find consensus, it might be worth seeking a third opinion or an RfC. '''chatspy """,0,0,0,0,0,0

While first reading this article I was slightly overwhelmed with the amount of information. However as the article progressed, I continued to see an increasing amount of methods (both right and wrong) that I recognized from first hand experience. Throughout high school I was continuously asked to tutor children (typically students between first and fourth grade) and so one of the most commonly used methods was the additive method. The children I tutored, especially the younger ones, found it difficult to distinguish when to use the multiplicative method versus the additive method. Originally I found this frustrating but reading this article, and in particular the section on the ‘Mr. Short and Mr. Tall’ experiment, made it clear as to why the kids didn’t understand. 

I am also studying astronomy in which we are studying Newton’s universal law of gravitation and hence this was one of the more interesting and appealing sections of the article for me. That being said, I think the author could have expanded upon this example by describing, for instance, the inverse square law in which tripling the distance between the objects would weaken the force of gravity by 3^2 and explaining so people who haven’t covered the subject would understand.",0,0,0,0,0,0

""""To state that is not correct is contradicting sourced material.""""  From the context, it appears that youre trying to contradict me, but I don't see how your comment advances that goal.  That the Resolution did not explicitly assert either claim absolutely is sourced; one need only look at the Resolution to see that.  That critics have not found a claim which is clearly false is a negative claim; do you seriously expect me to prove it?  What else is there?  That critics have claimed the war is based on lies?  You aren't seriously disputing that, are you?  So what, exactly, are you claiming is """"unsourced and incorrect""""?  Nice how anything that doesn't fit with your radical leftism is a """"highly biased slant"""".  As I have said, the Resolution never claimed that there was a working relationship between SH and AQ.  If you want to claim that the Resolution implied false statements, fine.  But anyone who claims that there is a single statement in the Resolution which is an outright lie is simply being dishonest.  Now, the Resolution cites Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction capability.  It does not cite Iraq's alleged weapons of mass destruction.  Therefore, YOUR edit is inaccurate and unsourced.  Since you have been informed of the error, and yet you continue to make a claim that you know is false, your editing is clearly vandalism, and if you continue to remove the word """"capability"""", I will seek administrative action.  There is simply no room for disagreement on the Contents section.  When discussing what a document says, we should quote what it actually says, rather than editing it for political convenience.  In the Weapons of Mass Destruction and Al-Qaeda section, you again are restoring unsourced statements.

 Hi Bbb23 I need your help and some advice about possible sockpuppetry 

Hi Bbb23,

I need your help and some advice about possible sockpuppetry. I am also going to ping User:PBS  @PBS so that he may have advice as well, or if you are really busy just now.

There has been ongoing disputes, edit warring, blatant blp issues, NPA's up to like 3 now from one certain editor.in and around the article for a pianist here at en wikipedia, as well as the blp board, edit warring boards (reports by two  different editors about the same James Rhodes (pianist)  article, page protection board, where @CambridgeBayWeather saw all the blp issuesthat were going on at the time she judged the need for protection there at the pianist article. User:CambridgeBayWeather in her admin role semi-protected the article for one week, then there were three WP:NPA violations against him, which I warned the editor on his talk page on two occasions.

 Since then the editor has struck up a whole band of possible sock monkeys to help defend him, and also some of the ones have made personal attacks againt me as well in the ani the editor filed.  I have been trying to state what has actually happened over this while, but there is so much disruption, attacking, and lacking good faith by him and some others there.

I just got to thinking this is so weird. All the possible soccy editors seemed to be acting in concert in how the flow of things went there so far.  I just kept my thoughts about all this to myself until now, but it occurred to me to check the block log of this editor to see if he had ever had any trouble with issues that he may have been blocked for.  I  asked him about the two blocks listed in the report. One block was for 72 hours and the next block was an INdeffinent. block. I noticed the offenses listed was sock puppeting and abusing multiple accounts. 

When I asked him about the sockpuppetry charge in the ani, he said something to the effect that """"he was testing wikipedias security"""" by """"setting up some vandalism only accounts"""" to test security. You could read his exact storyline that he posted on there. Are editors allowed to """"test security"""" by making up sockpuppets to vandalize editors, articles and such? Is he really working for you as a clerk or something?

To paraphrase, he said at ani it was just a couple of accounts, maybe 2 just to test with. I took his word on that for awhile, but then I took a break from making new articles, to just try typing his editor name and sockpuppet in wp search. This is what I found, it had your name on it so I thought you would be the perfect person to explain to me how this works exactly. [title=Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Gabucho181/Archive&oldid;=663847791]

Maybe I am not reading the pages and archives correctly since I do not follow the spi reports very often.  I see people speak of a duck rule, and or diffs of evidence is needed to request an investigation. I do not know myself is all this meets the duck rule or if there is any real evidence that this user may be continuing to abuse multi accounts or not,  But I was stunned to se reports on his  archive go back to januaey and the latest one was around may 18. Could you read this over if you have time to see if it warrants asking for all this to be checked on. I do not know how to do a spi report. I am not sure if it can be added on to the ongoing list that goes back several months? Please look it over and let me know something. I am going to work offline on my new article sets tonight, and upload them tomorrow or the next day. I have been doing a series of articles about different writers around the world, and then I make a few stubs from red links in the one about the writer. 

This is all very discouraging.   
Thank you.

If using hubs there is a limit imposed by the need for a collision to be detected everywhere, iirc it's officially two hubs for fast ethernet (though in practice you may get away with more due to shorter than required delays in the hubs) but hardly anyone uses hubs anymore so this is largely irrelevent in modern network design. Switches either seperate collision domains or eliminate them entirely so this isn't a problem on a switch based network. Eventually the delays would build up to the point where higher level protocols started to time out but the network would have to get huge for that to happen with most protocols.
Practically there are several other troublesome factors. One is that switches rely on storing the mac addresses of every machine on the lan to decide where to send packets. If there are too many machines for the switches to store the switches will """"fail open"""" and end up broadcasting traffic they don't know where to send to the whole network.

Article issues
This article has some issues that need to be addressed. The first is that of notability. As it is now, the article fails to establish any notability. It is merely a plot summary and, as was explained numerous times at Talk:List of NCIS episodes, Wikipedia is not for plot summaries. It is likely that each individual episode of a television series will not be notable on its own. As per WP:PLOT, """"a concise plot summary is appropriate as part of the larger coverage of a fictional work"""", but on its own the plot does not establish notability. As it says in the {{notability}} tag that kepps getting removed, notability needs to be established by adding reliable, secondary sources. At the moment, there are none. More on this later.

The plot summary in this article is not concise by any means. It needs to be pruned and appropriate information concerning """"the reception, impact, and significance"""" of the episode must be added.

A third issue is that of references. I've already mentioned that reliable, secondary sources do not exist in the article. Of the two references that do exist in the article, one is a primary source. The other (cbsncis.wetpaint.com) is a fan wiki that anyone can edit and so it is not a reliable source.

 The importance of Khalifman...and of Anand, Ponomariov, Kazimzhinov and Topalov...in being world champions during a time of crisis for FIDE...cannot be overstated.   They represent the rule of law  the functioning of the world title cycle  at a time when it was under direct attack by persons who viewed the title as private property, rather than as a sports title bestowed upon a player by a public cycle (as it had been from 1948 onward).  To say that Fischer, Kasparov or Alekhine were greater players...and therefore of more importance...overlooks this important aspect of Khalifman's title reign.   One could say that Fischer, Kasparov and Alkehine were stronger than Euwe and Smyslov, too...but that doesn't get us anywhere.   We don't rank US presidents by reputation  we list them all equally, yes?  Khalifman himself  in 1999 in interviews  said that although he was not the strongest player in the world (being 44th by rating)...he was clearly the world champion (having won the title in the open, public cycle run by FIDE).   That stand  that position  is what makes his title reign important.  BTW before anyone denigrates the """"FIDE Title Champions"""" ...it should be noted that at least two could be considered super-GMs (Anand and Topalov), and that one (Anand) regained the title via the classical method.

Wikipedia naming guidelines do not apply to """"unique titles"""", which can be interpreted as referring to works of art that are capitalized in a particular way for a reason. If an album cover clearly identifies the capitalization in a particular way, it should be displayed that way online. Gwernol, who is abusing his power as an administrator, decided to step in after I wrote a paragraph about Musicpvm in MY user page. If I'm not allowed to write my own opinions in my user page, then there is no point in a user page at all.

BTW, /where/ a particular critic is published or quoted is 'technically' only relevant (for verifiability) as far as the 'reputation' of the publication. Time and Womens Wear Daily are equally 'reputable sources', in the very sense I mean, as in that if either one publishes an interview with a major personality you can be pretty damn sure the person actually said the quotes. Writing """"Bob said 'I love it!'"""" is a 'statement of a fact directly known to the author'. The interviewer saw and heard the interviewee say it, unless they are lying, the publisher let them get away with it, and the interviewee didn't scream bloody murder. Doubtful for either of those magazines.
The same critic's interview published on the fansite 'www.ilovebooks.com' fails that test (His published quotes are 'notable', but not 'verifiable'). In the little known 'Collection of My Interviews of Book Critics', written by 'Joe English Professor, Ph.D.' and published by Oxford University Press it definitely passes due to scholarly review.
OTOH, the interview quotes of an 'unnamed Palestinean' as part of an article in Time about the West Bank pass the verifiability test, though 'notability' of the quotes would depend on context. The same article in Womens Wear Daily does not, as they are much less likely to have fact checked it as thoroughly, which is needed for something such as that. It's much more plausible that the WWD author spent his entire 'in country' time sitting in the hotel bar writing a fake article and got away with it. Get it?
It's also unlikely, TBH, that Bloom would have said anything different if he was asked the exact same questions, in the same order, by the same person, in the exact same context except that the interview was for Time. Also, a formal 'review' by him would have said the same thing....just in better language.
As far as a book review by a professional, which is a 'direct statement of opinion by an expert', where the critic is published is a function of his 'reputation', not vice versa. Peeps write reviews for Time instead of The Podunk Daily because of their reputation, and the fact they are published in Time is just an indication of that.
Say that famous reviewer retires, and only writes occasional reviews for his hometown paper, The Podunk Daily, to 'keep his hand in'. They are just as usable, though it might be harder to verify that (you can assume a reviewer published in Time is a 'good' one, you have to check the other one out).

 Epiwafer 

I am surprised to learn that """"epiwafer"""" was a popular term right around 2000-2002, the exact time that my company started to use epi wafers.  I should pay more attention to ads, I guess.  Anyway, it quickly settled back to more normal terminology, like """"epitaxial wafer"""", looks like.  I guess another move is in order.    

Hi , I think it best to look at all those Google searches on the Talk page, and see which spelling/nomenclature  adding the web + book, singular + plural spellings (that's four searches for each spelling)  has the most hits, for the title of the article. If you want, I can do that and add them up. Of course, the company name will skew """"epiwafer"""" so we can exclude that if you like.   
We don't use plurals, and book searches are generally more authoritative than web searches, but feel free to provide more data.    
Plurals are for the Google searches, because obviously many of the mentions (even in books) are only in plural, not singular, so an exact-phrase Google search (i.e., in quotation marks) will omit those mentions unless a plural form is searched. I'm fine with the fully spelled-out version as long as all of the other spellings redirect to it; therefore should probably also create a redirect for Epi-wafer, since that hyphenated form is sometimes used as well.

Both Paul and Kathryn should voluntarily cease editing this article unless and until all inappropriate links to theur site are removed. It's suitable for inclusion under External links, but not suuitable as a reference.

Request for help from some honest administrator

I apologize for contacting you in this way, I asked a friend to do it, please read and you will understand why:

I was very unfairly treated, please help me, here is what happened. I tried to post this at the debate but my voice has been strategically silenced so I needed to ask a friend to go there and ask for help.

The True of this story
 
After having heard many users (if in true are many and not a few posing as many) asking me to see it from Wikipedia's point of view or even from other user's point of view, I will give here my point of view, lets see if someone has the courage to say he/she understands and the determination to stand out of the crowd.
 
I was having a normal quiet Wikilife since a few weeks ago, I joined groups, I edited and was collaborating in the whole goal of Wikipedia.
Yesterday, I had a disagreement with user Durin at the talk page of user Demon, about the validity of existing a category for users who have chosen to be nice to newcomers
One hour or less after, user Durin """"coincidentally"""" """"finds out"""" that the humorous pictures I uploaded to my page, all of which were my work and in good  tone, are (or so he said) in other places in Internet 
I was told and was written since the first log by user Durin that I """"believe that I can download artwork from Internet and have rights on it""""
I requested immediate preventive deletion and I declared that the work is mine
I asked user Durin to tell me who and where is using my work, that is, where he saw it
User Durin said that the artwork was deleted and that is all, the matter was closed
I informed user Durin that I needed to know where he saw my work so I could take legal steps against who was using my artwork
User Durin said (absurdly) that I was threatening him with legal action
I said in more than one message that the legal action referred to whom, when and where was using my work, not to him
User Durin started to say that I was harassing him
Some of Durin's supporters (who some may be alter egos) showed support at his talk page and mine
I decided to see who was user Durin and read his works
From about 30 or more articles authored by user Durin, I tagged four of them because missing references and citations
Durin and supporters (some of who may be alter egos)claimed harassment
I spoke about the problem on the phone with the Dean and she advised me to let go and to contact e-pol.org, an agency that has helped them previously on matters regarding copyrights violations in the Net.
I followed advise, handled the editions of those articles to other editors for avoiding conflict of interests and wrote a polite message informing user Durin that I had abandoned my query with him even if he did not provide at any time who or where my work was used, I added recognition and 
apologized for rudeness and also that then I left the matters in the hands of the recommended agency and that unless he wanted to help, he didn't need further involvement given that the agency would sort out who is using my work.
User Durin misunderstood my message and panicked (by reasons only known to him) and """"retired"""" from Wikipedia informing so at his page. Also please be aware that reading user Durin's pages, he has been """"threatening"""" with retiring for a good while, seemingly using this situation in good timing.
""""Coincidentally"""" an administrator's attention was called by the issue and blocked me for legal threats (please keep in  mind that these existed only in the interpretation of others of my words and not in precise wording and less in my intentions)
I requested unblocking and I was requested to prove that no Wikipedian or Wikiorganization was involved in any legal action
I asked the agency I reported the case to, to please inform Wikipedia about their no involvement, they did so clearly saying that the case is against sites using my work and neither Wikipedia nor any editor is involved in the case.
Far from the block be removed, the administrators not only left the block in place, in spite of no legal threats existed, but also questioned the existence of the agency handling my case
In the most """"interrogation"""" or better said """"organized crime"""" fashion, I received administrator's messages that I must tell who they are or I will remain blocked. It seems no longer the block obeys to policies about legal threats.
User Durin, while """"retired"""" and showing so at his page, left messages in the blocking discussion page (my talk page) warning administrators to not lift the block (curious retirement)

 Add-in of old material or add to new page 

This edit was definately a great improvement, the only thing is it stripped out some information that I think was good. How about we add some of it back in or add some of it to start a new artcile Goddard Space Flight Center Facilities or List of facilities of the Goddard Space Flight Center or something like that. Comments? Here is the material that was taken out on that edit:

West Campus
The West Campus contains buildings that support administration, research, design and construction of spacecraft, operation of spacecraft, information storage and archival, and data analysis. The buildings generally are two to three stories high, often brick, and simply detailed. Amenities include two cafeterias, a base exchange operated by the Goddard Employees Welfare Association (GEWA), a library, a health services unit, a post office, and recreation areas. West Campus facilities include:
The Diffraction Grating Evaluation Facility (DGEF) was developed at Goddard to evaluate optical components such as diffraction gratings, mirrors, and filters as well as detection systems used in space instrumentation. 
The Flight Dynamics Facility (FDF) provides engineering services to missions including orbit determination, attitude determination, maneuver planning, spacecraft navigation systems, and attitude sensor performance analysis. Currently, FDF provides orbit and attitude determination for more than 15 NASA spacecraft, and also supports Space Shuttle operations and expendable launch vehicles. 
The High Capacity Centrifuge located in Building 15 is a 30 g rotary accelerator capable of rotating 5,000 pound payloads at up to 30 RPM and is housed in its own circular building. Tilt fixtures allow the orientation of test articles in a wide range of attitudes and angles. 
The NASA Communications Network (NASCOM) is a global system that provides communications support to all NASA projects. Voice, data, and teletype links are available through the network for connecting the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) with user spacecraft control centers. Land lines, submarine cables, and microwave/satellite links make up this communications system. 
The Network Control Center (NCC) manages the total Space Network. The NCC schedules and configures the TDRSS and monitors the status of ongoing scheduled services. Operators schedule emergency services, isolate any problems in the system, and restore faulty user services. The Control Center communicates with other stations through the NASCOM network.
The Building 3/13/14 Payload Operations Control Centers (POCC) are facilities that provide support to one or more spacecraft missions. Some are operated from GSFC, for example SOHO, and some are operated from offsite, for example Swift. Equipment located in control centers handles all data, generates commands, and interfaces with other stations. The control centers also process experiment commands and telemetry, and control payload and instrument operations. The Hubble Space Telescope Control Center (STOCC) in Building 3 is the facility where Hubble Space Telescope (HST) managers and engineers monitor and control the orbiting observatory. Past missions operated at GSFC include the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, COBE, and IUE.
The Space Environment Simulator is a three-story high thermal-vacuum chamber (nicknamed """"The SES"""") located in Building 10 that features an 8.2 meter diameter by 12.2 meter high vacuum chamber capable of simulating temperature and vacuum conditions for virtually any launch or orbital environment condition. Shroud temperatures within the chamber can be controlled to -180 °C to +100 °C. 
The National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) at GSFC provides online and offline access to a wide variety of astrophysics, space plasma and solar physics, lunar and planetary, and Earth science data from NASA space flight missions. NSSDC also provides access to online information for the spacecraft and experiments that have or will provide public access data. 
The Spacecraft Fabrication Facility where Goddard technicians and engineers manufacture components used for spacecraft assembly. This includes the tools which the astronauts use in space as well as the spacecraft themselves.
The Building 29 Spacecraft Systems Development and Integration Facility is a 7990 m² facility that contains one of the largest cleanrooms in the world. The High Bay Cleanroom is a , class 1,000 (M4.5), horizontal flow cleanroom measuring 30.5 x 38 x 27 meters (100'x125'x89'). Its five {{con",0,0,0,0,0,0

In the meantime, I would be interested in any further comments you might have on the following issues:
 Given that MickMacNee was already to remain blocked for 72 hours, was immediate escalation of the block length necessary even in the context of a stated intent to resume the conduct in question?  In particular, I'm interested in your thoughts on (a) whether the 72 hour period could instead have been used to reach a more amicable arrangement and (b) whether a removal of the underlying cause for conflict (in this case, Hammersoft's redaction of his original remarks) would have made any such statements of intent moot at the time the block expired.
 A number of editors have suggested that Hammersoft's comments were themselves personal attacks, or may have (intentionally or unintentionally) baited MickMacNee into an aggressive response.  To what degree is this explanation credible; and, if it is, to what degree does it mitigate MickMacNee's culpability?

This etymological discussion is simply wrong in so many ways:
The Greek name tigris comes from the Old Persian word for """"tiger"""" and means """"the fast one"""". It might also be argued to come from Kurdish too. In Kurdish """"Tir"""" means arrow. This means that the river is quick and fast like an arrow.Tîj-Tûj means sharp, pointing and cutting. Since the letter """"j"""" doesn't exist in Greek Tîj-Tûj became Tig later Tigr.In Greek at the end of words -is sonex is used (Tîj-Tijr-Tig-Tigr-Tigris). 

First of all, the Persian for """"tiger"""" is babr, not tigr or anything like it.  The Greek word """"tigris"""" meaning """"tiger"""" may be related to Persian words within the same family as """"*tigr"""", but that is not the Persian meaning of the words.

Second, the Kurdish (and Farsi) word for """"arrow"""", tir, comes from Middle Persian tigr  which also means """"arrow"""".

Third, the word tij (or rather tiz) """"sharp"""" is certainly related to tigr, but they belong to the same word family  they are not the same word.

The separation of Michael's personal life info from the main 'eras' section is going too far with this categorization thing which seems to have swept up the article recently. Introducing an 'influence' section was alright, as that didn't take from the main body, the chronological section, of the article. But taking out things deemed 'personal' and plonking them neatly under four different areas just doesn't flow well. It junts the reader in and out of various years, and just doesn't work. Before, the article was chronological, and a certain degree of chronology is good in a biographical article. Let me clear up one thing: the eras don't just mean what was related to the ALBUM of the era. The eras are simply a convenient way of splitting up Michael's life into nice sections. We don't need to FURTHER split the article up. I think that we should put personal stuff back into the main chronological bit, as people seem to have misinterpreted what the 'eras' are meant to be. His career and his personal life should go together. For example, the Oprah Interview, once aired, significantly increased sales of Dangerous. That link cannot be neatly established if the two 'bits' (for lack of a better word) are separated. I am trying to reach a new consensus to have the personal stuff put back into the main body, as right not the article seems to be a skeleton of subheadings.

Anyone can write a song about any topic they want. The point of the genre is to describe the actual music involved and how it's played. Where's the fact that bands very rarely used clean, melodic singing vocals early on?

Mariah Carey (born March 27, 1970) is a R&B; and pop singer, songwriter, record producer and occasional actress of the 1990s and 2000s. Making her debut in 1990, she became the most successful and best-selling artist of the coming decade according to Billboard magazine and the World Music Awards. In 2000, the World Music Awards show named her the best-selling female recording artist of all time.

Carey is noted for her distinctive singing style that makes frequent use of melismas and other ornamentation, and she possesses a five-octave vocal range. She released a throng of number-one hits while signed to Columbia Records, formerly run by then-husband Tommy Mottola, and several of them broke chart records. By the turn of the millennium, however, Carey's popularity with critics and the public had entered decline, and she was dropped from her new record label following a highly-publicised physical breakdown and an unsuccessful foray into film. In 2005, Carey returned to the forefront of popular music with the release of the multi-platinum The Emancipation of Mimi.

Biography and music career
Early life and discovery
Carey was born in Huntington, New York. She is the third and youngest child of Patricia Hickey, a Catholic opera singer and voice coach of Irish-American descent, and Alfred Roy Carey (né Núñez), an aeronautical engineer of Afro-Venezuelan descent. She was named after the song """"And They Call the Wind Maria"""", from the musical Paint Your Wagon. Carey's siblings include her older sister Alison, and her older brother Morgan. As a multiracial family, the Carey household was met with racial slurs, hostility, and sometimes violence, causing the family to move frequently around the New York area. The strain on the family led to the divorce of Carey's parents when she was three years old. Carey had little contact with her father, and her mother worked several jobs to support the family.

Spending much of her time at home alone, Carey turned to music as an outlet. She began singing at the age of four, and first performed in public at the age of six. She began writing songs while in grade school, and her mother and the members of her opera company were impressed with her talents when Carey hit a cue note that her mother had missed. Carey attended and graduated from Oldfield Middle School and Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, although she was frequently absent due to efforts to break into the music business. After moving to New York City, she eventually landed a role as a backup singer for Brenda K. Starr.

In 1988, Carey met Columbia Records executive Tommy Mottola at a party, where Starr gave him a demo tape. Mottola played the tape while leaving the party and was very impressed by what he heard. He returned to the party to find Carey, but she had already left. Nevertheless, Mottola tracked her down and signed her to a recording contract. This Cinderella-like story became part of the standard publicity surrounding Carey's entrance into the industry.

1990–1992: Early commercial success
Carey's professional music career began with the release of her eponymous debut album, Mariah Carey, in 1990. Carey co-wrote all of the compositions on her debut album with songwriter-producers such as Ric Wake and Rhett Lawrence, and would continue to co-write nearly all of her material for the rest of her career.

You cannot just go out and make a Lord of the Rings film without the required licensing, since all LOTR films are made from the same intellectual property. The Peter Jackson series is not a franchise, it is one instance of an independently produced series in a franchise that includes multiple adaptations across multiple media. Batman is similar: Batman is a franchise that includes comics, multiple independent adaptations and merchandise. We could just have a chart of each independent series, but that would mean separating the Batman films, separating the Spider-Man films etc, but the chart does this anyway, because you can just expand the entries. The article retains a neutral point of view on what data we present, since readers may be just as interested in the collective value of the whole Batman franchise as opposed to just one series in it; on the other hand, they must just be interested in the Nolan series. Either way it doesn't matter because both sets of data are given. Likewise with the Middle Earth films, the reader has access to how much the franchise has earned as a whole, how much the Jackson series has earned as a whole, and how much just the LOTR trilogy within the Jackson series has earned as a whole. It covers all possible ways a reader might want to interpret the information. As for the information being out of date, there is usually a short lag between Sunday-Monday as the data is released and then update in the chart.

 Basques and more... 

If anybody knows why Claret is also called Bordeaux and is so popular in England, then perhaps we should include Basques (e.g. Piers Gaveston).  Basques entered English society at the same historic time as the Irish.  I also find it odd that Normans should get monolithic mention, without Brittany.  The Duchy of Brittany was a feudal subdomain of English Kings from the Norman Conquest until the 16th Century, in one capacity or another.  Aside from that, we all know the British (Welsh) connection that practically makes them who they are by definition.  Saint-Pierre and Miquelon has a flag and coat of arms which match English ethnic cousins on the Continent, because virtually all of New France was founded by those """"Frenchmen"""" once under English yoke (north and west coasts of """"France"""").  England's arms supposedly include Aquitaine and Gascony as well as the well-known Normandy.

IMHO:

Normandy has best ethnic transferance with England.  Both Scandinavian.
Brittany has best ethnic transferance with Wales.  Both Romano-Briton.
Aquitaine and Gascony has best ethnic transferance with Ireland.  Celtic/Basque connexions (hmm, Queen Mary's marriage with Spain).

All of these domains were of great post-Conquest importance, with added Scotland under Stuarts.  The union of the crowns under James (after the Tudor-Habsburg struggle) marked the divergence of a merely English people and it is from there, that a new British people was formed with participation in the Dutch and German dominions.  As far as I know and now think, the new """"British people"""" is mostly a network of upper class/parliamentary aristocrats and their personal heritage.

I am proud to sport a 1/8th Aquitainian/Poitevin (although Huguenot) ancestor.  I don't know further genealogy to find a recent Parisian (non-London) French (what is called France, but has English character) ancestor.  You know what side this ancestor would have fought on if Buckingham's war with France got serious.  This opens up a window to the past glories of the Angevin Empire for me because although I sport a Scottish colonial American wife, my own specific heritage does not leave the bounds of the three leopards of the Plantagenet dominions.

What some people should look at, is the French Wars of Religion maps.  Huguenots are numerous in Aquitaine/Gascony and Toulouse, both former Angevin areas.  One wonders if this Protestantism is an Albigensian Crusade relic, an Arian Visigothic vs Catholic Frankish relic or both combined with a culture of English resistance to the Capetians.

Also, if mentioning the Danes we shouldn't neglect the Norwegians.  I think the Royal Website summarizes our English ethnic roots by explaining them dynastically and the personal unions that encouraged a compatible mix of people.  That is why I believe the """"French people"""" are reasonably well related; to nitpick or split hairs on it is just ridiculous.

Of course we can mention the view point here even using Press TV as a source but it should not be stated as a fact and consequently we can't have it in infobox if press TV is the only source.   

 I think what genuinely matters more than verbatim use of the term, is whether the source characterizes the movement as being one opposed to Imperialism which Wikipedia defines as """"a policy of extending a country's power and influence through colonization, use of military force, or other means"""". Having said that, the expert POV by PressTV does even employ the term """"anti-Imperialist"""" verbatim to describe the Houthis. Russia Today also suggests that the struggle is part of the post-colonialist movements' struggle against imperialists and colonialists. Likewise, the author in the linked paper from Taylor & Francis identifies the same anti-imperialist themes in Hussein al-Houthi's thoughts. Furthermore beyond these sources, the very fact that Houthis' antagonists are well-known to be in alliance with the living reality of US Imperialism and the blatant reality of the ongoing war against Yemen are themselves obvious clues reaffirming the nature of the struggle by the Houthis as being anti-Imperialist in nature. Houthi leaders have also numerously stressed that they are aspiring for independence from foreign influence (namely US and Saudi) as already mentioned in the article. So I think it must be now obvious that the tag represents a definite fact, and restoration is well due.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

From the Hood quote it certainly looks as though it's altered enough (and both versions were successful enough) for each to have a separate article - that's one issue. (Although I do wonder about the 1983 Sadler's Wells version. If it had a new book and lyrics, it clearly wasn't Hood and Ross's version - so is it a version of Count, or of Graf? Does anyone know about the music?)

As for the other - I'd say it's definitely an operetta. Unless we can prove some substantial alteration of the music - style, vocal range, whatnot - it's the music from an operetta, and the show is an operetta.

I sincerely believe that's what everyone is trying to do, but approaching it from different directions.  The """"Queen of Pop"""" thing is not the biggest problem here.  There's a sentence in the article that describes Madonna as one of the most important people in the history of the world.  Really, that kind of overstatement does her a disservice.  She's made an incredible, unique contribution to pop music, culture etc but that's barely acknowledged in favor of a bunch of meaningless praise.  Can we please look at the entire article, and rather than give examples such as Bette Midler, which is not a particularly good article, please compare it to the various singers, actors, performers etc who are the subjects of featured articles.  There are numerous """"bad"""" articles that we could use as a rationale for the development of the Madonna article but I would prefer to draw inspiration from the best articles rather than the mediocre.  There is some justification for the """"Divine Miss M"""" reference.  She was actually known by that moniker early in her career as it was a character she created and for a time she was that character on and off-stage.  Her stage show and album used the same name - it was a strong connection.  Maybe not strong enough for the lead sentence, but it doesn't compare with the media created """"Queen of Pop"""" tag. 

Once again I draw your attention to WP:LEAD.  Please take a few moments to read it so that we can at least try to tackle this from the same angle instead of all this bickering, which is doing nothing but harm.  Nothing should be in the lead section that is not in the article because the lead is meant to be a summary of the article.  If the """"Queen of Pop"""" reference is so important, please discuss it in the article so it at least has some context.  """"She's commonly called """"Queen of Pop"""".   Big deal - what does that mean?  There's no attempt to place it into any context, there's no meaning, no explanation.  Please try to keep personal opinions aside and use WP guidelines to approach the article objectively.  Wikipedia:What is a featured article? is also full of useful tips on what to aim for.

 VfD on Jews by country 

This has not yet been submitted, and John would wig out if I submitted it myself. But I suggest you discuss this with others ASAP. I submit for your discussion with others that the author has little regard for misrepresenting the reliability of his figures, that the article gives a inferior knowledge than the Jewish population article does both of current and pass population tends. That the title is questionable in its honesty because as he shows at the top of the discussion page, following his prevuious pattern he should have used the less offensive title Judaism by country. And finally, the figures which he has published do not come from the listed reference pages as he infers but have been generated by himself by multiplying the est. 2005 populations by the rough percentage numbers for the countries.

As an example, being Australian I checked his figure for """"Australian Jews"""" in his words. None of his references give his figure of 100,452. Nor do any of the reputable sources pretend to give percise religious numbers to six or eight digit accuracy. In fact, checking the references you quickly discover that the 2001 Australian census gave the figure of 84,000 people who marked Judaism as their religion. That all other real estimates are based upon adjustments to that figure, as is discussed on this page I found by a Christian Research Association. I finally did a Google searchon his claimed figure to discover that Wikipedia is the only publication claiming such a figure. So I finally submit that this article relects badly upon Wikipedia and adds no meaningful value beyond the fine work already done in Jewish population. I am afraid this is seems to be another example of where this author has misrepresented certain details to create the illusion that he is scholarly NPOV author. 17:32, 11 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

According to your Rump section, there are still Progressive Conservatives who sit in parliament. So the party is not dead. See the extract below.   

Rump PC caucus
Following the merger, a rump Progressive Conservative caucus remained in Parliament, consisting of individuals who declined to join the new Conservative Party. In the House of Commons, Joe Clark, André Bachand and John Herron sat as PC members.

In the 2004 election, Bachand and Clark did not to run for re-election, and Herron ran as a Liberal, losing to Rob Moore in his riding of Fundy—Royal. Scott Brison, who had joined the Liberal caucus immediately upon departing the Conservative Party, was reelected as a Liberal in the 2004 election.

In the Senate, William Doody, Lowell Murray and Norman Atkins also declined to join the new party, and continue to sit as Progressive Conservative senators. On March 24, 2005, Prime Minister Paul Martin appointed nine new senators, two of whom, Nancy Ruth and Elaine McCoy, were designated as Progressive Conservatives. Thus there may be Progressive Conservative senators until 2021 when McCoy, the youngest of the five, attains the mandatory retirement age of 75, or later if subsequent senators designate themselves Progressive Conservatives. Nancy Ruth has since left to sit with the Conservative Party. Adding the death of Senator Doody on December 27, 2005, this reduced the number of PC Senators to three.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Ethnocentric statement of """"discovery"""" of gold 

How can you discovery something the existence of which has already been established although those that proclaim it discovered were mistaken. Gold was found in California w/early explorers along Colorado River & near Mexican era Los Angeles in 1832 so existence of gold only confirmed not discovered in 1848 although the find was reason for the 1849 Rush, the latter the unique part of incident. To say that gold was discovered in California in 1848 is an ethnocentric statement as well as an example of ignorance by those that either do not want to acknowledge that gold had already been verified as being in California therefore it cannot be a discovery. Finding more gold is not a discovery but a re-confirmation of the existence of gold in the area.66.74.176.59  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

@Settleman 

In this article that you created, you wrote """"(...) pray at the compound"""". That's not exactly what the source says.

Would you mind reporting the statu quo that has been negociated between Jewih religious authorities and Waqf, as well as between Jordan and Israeli authorities regarding the management of the """"al-Haram al-Sharif / Temple Mount"""". That's an important background in order to understand the situation. Of course, would some group contests this, that should reported too.

I could not find this in the source  """"funded by the northern branch of Israel’s Islamic Movement"""". The reference to Isrel is amazing and in any case requires a very good sources with information cross-checking.

One thing occurred to me in my languid repose: we should discuss the age dependence of the immune system.  You know, how young toddlers seem to have super-charged immune systems (important for surviving day-care) whereas older people get sick more readily?  One cute factoid I gleaned from a dentist was that older people get a lot more cavities because they have dry mouths; producing less saliva means fewer protective peptides and they suck on sweet lozenges to wet their whistles, providing a nice diet of pure sucrose for their unwelcome guests.  Anyway, speaking more generally, I think that lay readers would be really interested in the whole age-dependence thing, as it touches all their lives.  Maybe someone there can look into it?  I'll try to tackle the hormonal thing.

 Clarification on Wikipedia naming standards 

Hi Kohikoi,

You just left a message on my talkpage where you immediately threatened to block me out of the blue instead of a friendly suggestion or attempt to discuss/investigate. I would like to remind you that Wikipedia:Administrator_Code_of_Conduct | Wikipedia admin code of conduct}} guidelines specifically state...

threatening a user with an inappropriate block is just as bad behavior as actually making that block
admins should never use their admin abilities to intimidate others

To deal with your concerns though. From my tandpoint I just corrected a breach of Wikipedia naming standards that appear politically motivated. However,you just suggested the current version of these pages are the result of a long-standing consensus between several users. Do you have evidence of this consensus? (i.e Where exactly is it reported on Wikipedia?) As far as I can tell the page for  naming conventions of Greek and Turkish named places specifically states... 

""""This Wikipedia page is currently inactive and is retained as a historical archive. Either the page is no longer relevant or consensus has become unclear. If you want to revive discussion regarding the subject, you should seek broader input via a forum such as the proposals page of the village pump.""""

Furthermore, I have to ask why is there suddenly a special page only for Greek/Turkish naming conventions in the first place? The standards proposed on that page appear to directly contridict broader Wikipedia naming standards which state...

Use modern English names for titles and in articles. Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution.

RSA Labss (Now EMC), MIT, and ACM are wrong? 
VQuaker.  I am used to accepting correction when it is due, but for the life of me I cannot understand why cited information from a primary source (RSA Labs) on the fourth factor of authentication is not worth knowing.  I am confronted with the information that because it is not a legal requirement as far as you know, it must be spurious.  Some people know that it's better to get their legal information from government sources, not Wikipedia.  If you are holding up this resource as some type of CFR or USC guide, exposition, or sanctioned resource, then I believe the U.S. Government would like to hear your ideas.  Further, """"someone you know"""" (or knows you) is part of network administrationwhich is part of the brilliance.  Needing a cohort or supervisor to provide a human factor is difficult to defeat.  Though, I suspect you know this already.  I'm not offended though, just immensely confused as to why this item of access control must be devoid of technical information and meet some arbitrary legal standard.  I would ask you this: if a user loses their SmartCard (i.e. CAC) and forgets their password, with the premise being that biometric devices or other inherence factor methodologies are not deployed, in most situations does an administrator with knowledge of the user ask they be terminated, or do they reissue credentials based on knowing the person?  There are organizations that will terminate you, but I couldn't have said that in my expounding of the 4th factor because it would mean citing information not available to the lay. (I do hope I can """"talk"""" without citing what those in DF and IS would consider common knowledge.)  When we set out, it was to provide reliable information, if the mission has changed, well who could tell?  Consider me a non-contributor from now onwe aren't allowed to use Wikipedia anyway where I work, it is an anathema.  Say what you want unless it surprises someone and then an ego check is issued. I should expect nothing less, after all, I teach.  What changed the tone was your dumbing-down and use of nonsensical examples that could not be used to authenticate someone.  Smell?  Non-sequitur.  You gave me things to read, but I'm still waiting for you to cite Wikipedia's policy that information be legally sanctioned and in the format expected by a barrister.  I cited my sourcewhere is the citation that the language style, organization, and applicability be in-line with one or more regulatory bodies?

Now a better way to be proactive would be to realize that academic databases (do you have access to them [Elsevier, JSTOR, EDAS, IEEE, SpringerLink], they can be pricey if you try and yet without them you're stuck in a Google funk, but I digress) are full of references to fourth factor.  That cash register key the manager uses when you return something, yep, someone you know.  An that's been around for decades!  Sign up for an account with an ISP, there it is again!  Take joy in knowing you have some sheriff star and are for the most part helpful.  I just didn't realize you alone set these standards.  I repent in ashes and wrend my sackcloth accordingly.

a4bd7f9ff0ba4213,"Chapter Nine
In chapter nine Burlington, Vermont Kolbert writes about Burlington, Vermont’s largest city. Years ago the citizens decided to stand up to global warming by using less power instead of buying more. The mayor of Burlington, Peter Clavelle, who has been mayor since 1989, came up with a program that encourages contractors to engage not in demolition but in “deconstruction”. This helps the city save energy by reducing waste and cutting down the need for new materials. Burlington’s electric department (BED) has a wind turbine that provided enough power for thirty homes and gets half of its energy from renewable sources, such as its 50 megawatt power plant that runs off of wood chips. The BED also leases compact florescent light bulbs for twenty cents a month because a family who uses these bulbs can cut their electricity bill by 10 percent. The city of Burlington estimates that their energy saving projects over the course of this lifetime will prevent the release of 175,000 tons of carbon. Burlington residents also eat locally and have turned old waste sites into an assortment of community gardens and cooperatives, the waste from these gardens is taken to a composting factory, and turned back into soil, making this process “closed loop”. Clavelle’s plan has begun to pick up across America beginning with Greg Nickles, the mayor of Seattle, who created a set of principles called the “US Mayors Climate Protection Agreement”. This agreement has been signed by over a hundred and seventy mayors, representing about thirty – six million people. This agreement is trying to prove how much can be done at the local level and Clavelle hopes that more cities will adopt this plan.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi, I think that you are doing well with the GA review on the parathyroid gland. There are certain things about it that I would find difficult to describe quickly that makes me think that it is nudging GA status, but not quite there yet. Of course, the parathyroid glands and PTH are only part of a system that regulates Ca and PO4. Parathyroids have a thin capsule. According to my books, the sizes can be asymmetrical, so it would be better to say that a normal parathyroid gland is less than 60 g, than give the average weight. If you think that I could contribute something to the final phase of the GA over the next week or two, then I would appreciate it if you could check my grammar of anything that I added to the article.

 Peter Birks 

Dear Legis

I have had to revert most of the edits made to the article Peter Birks because they were virtually indistinguishable from Jack Beatson, 'Peter Birks' (Obituary), The Guardian (16 July 2004), accessed 18 August 2009. You appear to be the editor who was responsible for reproducing a large quantity of copyright material in this article. I am surprised to find this kind of editing being done by a lawyer with a first-class degree. Just to show to what an extent you had plagiarised the material, compare:

He became regius professor of civil law at Oxford University and a fellow of All Souls College in 1989, having held chairs at Edinburgh (1981-87) and, briefly, at Southampton. Before that, he was a tutorial fellow of Brasenose College, Oxford (1971-81), a strong law college to which he remained very close, and taught at University College London.

He was elected a fellow of the British Academy in 1989, and an honorary fellow of Trinity College, Oxford, his undergraduate college, in 1994; ... He was made an honorary Queen's counsel in 1995, and served as president of the Society of Legal Scholars in 2002-03. He lectured and taught throughout the Commonwealth and in Europe. (The Guardian)

... [Birks,] with Robert Goff and Gareth Jones, [was] a key figure in the extraordinary development of the law of restitution in the last 45 years. (The Guardian)

Birks, together with Robert Goff and Gareth Jones, was a key figure in the extraordinary development of the law of restitution in the last 45 years. (Your edit)

And so it continues, including the lifting, almost wholesale, of this paragraph:

One example of his influence may be seen in the 1991 decision in Woolwich Building Society v Inland Revenue. This held, for the first time, that citizens are entitled to recover taxes paid in a case where the tax authorities are not entitled to them. The reasoning of the court of appeal closely followed that in a Birks essay but, possibly because the lawyers had adopted his arguments without attribution, the judgments do not refer to the essay. This was put right in the House of Lords, where Lord Goff described the essay as """"powerful"""". (The Guardian)

One example of his influence may be seen in the 1991 decision in Woolwich Building Society v Inland Revenue. In that case the courts [synonymous with The Guardian's original, 'This'] held, for the first time in English law [you add 'in English law'], that citizens are entitled to recover taxes paid in a case where the tax authorities had no legal right to levy them [again, synonymous with the original]. The reasoning of the court of appeal closely followed that in a Birks essay but the judgments did not refer to his writing (some critics suggest this was because the lawyers adopted his arguments without attribution) [you move a subordinate clause from the middle of the sentence to the end, varying the wording just slightly]. This was put right in the House of Lords, where Lord Goff described his writings [='the essay'] as """"powerful"""". (Your edit)

You copy a bit more copyright material, and at the end of the article even clumsily leave in, '· Peter Brian Herrenden Birks, academic lawyer, born October 3 1941; died July 6 2004'.

Disappointing editing from a highly educated member of the legal profession.

Listen: there were 350,000 Germans in Vojvodina before the war, and about 250,000 of them left from the region together with the withdrawal German army, before partisans took control of the region. The remaining 100,000 were the subject for persecution. Also, it is not quite correct that those 250,000 fled the partisans, but they fled the Soviet Red Army. Partisans came after Red Army (or together with it at least). Also, it is the main difference between Germans and Jews, since most of the Jews were killed or deported during the war, while most of the Germans escaped before they could became a subject for persecutions. Second thing, during the war, Serbs also were persecuted and thousands of them were held in prison camps or expelled. The only difference between Germans and Serbs here is that Serbs returned to their homes after the war, and Germans did not. So, is that difference a good reason to write here only about persecuted Germans and not about persecuted Serbs too? It is good that you said that the one who want to know who were partisans should to read the """"Partisans"""" article, because the one who want to know more why Germans fled should to read Danube Swabians article. However, the kind of compromise I would accept would be to write that most of the Germans colaborated with German troops during the war, and that this was a reason why partisans persecuted them. Every consequence have its root somewhere, right?  (talk)

It seems at the end of the day, I'm convinced that both you and Vintagekits are to blame for a series of Wikipedia-as-battleground incidents, and you do not. From where I sit however, when he went straight to his old battleground, you welcomed him back in kind - and the fact is on Wiki experienced users are expected to do better than that. Some sort of attempt at peacemaking is best, or some sort of dialogue or somesuch. When you ran straight to an admin and then AN/I to get the topicban reinstated, it showed me that you are not interested (probably because you believe it is impossible) in working together with Vintagekits - and possibly others who share his viewpoint. You see it as more Vintagekits' fault, but from my chair, you're both beyond the cutoff. Please remember, my job is to not create parity, equity, equality, or even justice, though I flatter myself and think I can produce it in my own life on occasion. No, I am an administrator not a philosopher-king, and at the end of the day Wikipedia needs no one, not you, Vintagekits, or I, more than it needs a productive working environment as a whole.

When I was involved with Vintagekits' topic ban, at the previous round with the Baronets and troubles bans, I can tell you that they worked to great effect, maintaining him in a topic of interest - despite his protestations of injustice. I hope you can find something you're interested in as well outside your original main content.

That there is bidding should be spelled out in the parent article.  That there are only 15 useable words which partners may use to describe their hand and to arrive at a contract should be spelled out, the concept of strain or demonination should be presented and the rules of play.  But I don't believe it would be appropriate to do more than touch on bidding systems.  Rubber bridge is the way Contract Bridge is scored.  Then, Duplicate bidge adds another layer of scoring complexity in addition to the already present and continually used, rubber bridge scoring. In addition, Duplicate Bridge adds another layer of rigidity to what cards partnerships hold.  In this manner the element is skill is boosted while the element of luck (unavoidably present) is made smaller.  The Duplicate bridge article could get into the bidding boxes, the curtain used in large, international tournements and so on.  But I would very much like to see these articles be friendly and readable so that a person who had never played bridge could read them and could find a logical development of complexity and of expertise required.  So that a green player could view both how to begin to learn to play and where the top is too, that people make their living at playing bridge, that there are international tournements of great interest, that some top bridge players are recognized by various public figures and so on.  So that a person can follow the logical development of being a beginning player, right through to becoming a top player.

 Re: How to pronounce maize? 
How do you pronounce maize? - """"maze"""" (rhymes with days) or """"mize"""" (rhymes with eyes)?  This needs to be made apparent, and does not seem to have been addressed (except perhaps for those readers who are conversant with the special symbols denoting pronunciation, which the casual reader is not).
72.73.250.57  
 Re: How to pronounce maize? 
My apologies - It appears that there is an attempt on the page to explain how to pronounce maize - there is an """"ei"""" reference where the """"ei"""" appears to be in a different font from the rest of the the sentence, and that corresponds to a rhyming with """"days"""" (i.e., not rhyming with """"eyes""""). But to the first-time reader this is easy to overlook. Perhaps with further experience with the Wikipedia pages, I will not be so quick to jump to these conclusions of inadequacy.  But for now, suffice it to say that a casual browser of these pages can quite easily make the same mistake(s) that I have. In other words, it seems like a simple statement like """"rhymes with ..."""" would prevent such waste of time and resources. Again, my apologies...""""mea culpa"""".

Whenever anyone states a clearly obvious uncontested fact in Wiki, which is what about 50% of Wiki is, unless someone can show the logical fallacy of the statement being presented as fact, it is usually not removed due to lack of documentation.

Now if I were wrong about this in an article, then perhaps someone would first point out specifically that they have heard that the Dravidian culture is centered in the North of India, and could I please document my claim that it is centered in the South.

(deindent) Not even wrong only if you don't understand what he's doing. These are all standard problems for the many millions of people who have tried to make sense of infinite arithmetic at some point in their lives.

The number  ...9997 in Archimedes' system is also known as the number -3, which almost is the """"largest prime"""" in Ludwig's order on the Plutonian integers. You would think ...99998 might be the right one, but that's -2, and it is clearly divisible by two. So maybe ...9997 should be thought of as divisible by three, but dividing by three is different than dividing by two in base-10, because two divides 10 and three does not. So maybe that's a self-consistent definition in a 10-based infinite arithmetic with the order he chooses. Maybe not. I don't know, but neither do you, and to pretend otherwise is insincere. It's not incoherent, just original, and incomplete. The methodology is obviously many, many, painstaking infinite digit calculations, with the extra burden that the rules keep shifting whenever he finds an inconsistency. 

The reason he claims transcendental numbers are incomplete is because, if you accept that the integers are Plutonian, the real numbers are only """"finitely"""" wide. Normally, a real number can be thought of as a map from Z->digits, giving it's digit sequence. Unfortunately, Plutonium's """"Z"""" is just as large as the real numbers, so that a real number is really only a sequence of digits, because a sequence in this view cannot be viewed as a map from Z-> digits. In this view Z is larger than any sequence (the integers are """"uncountable""""). So the real numbers have """"gaps"""" which would be filled by reciprocals of infinite integers. But large integers don't have reciprocals in Plutonium's system, because he can't make any sense out of bi-infinite sequences:

Numbers like ... 999123.3333..... are not allowed because you can't do multiplication digit by digit.

So he doesn't think of the real numbers as containing the integers, he has two classes of numbers the """"Adic integers"""" which are infinite to the left and finite to the right, and the """"real numbers"""" which are infinite to the right and finite to the left, and it is illegal to add an adic integer and a real number.

The reason Archimedes Plutonium keeps working on the Riemann Hypothesis is because he feels he can say something new about the distribution of primes because he has knowledge of some infinite ones. This is because he can ask questions like """"if I choose an infinite integer at random, digit by digit, do I get a prime number?"""" Those sorts of questions have analytic counterparts about real numbers (complete numbers really). He probably feels the twin-prime conjecture is false, becuase, what's the chance that the infinite integer ....321113 and ....321115 are both prime? He also probably feels that an infinite even number can never be the sum of two primes. These last two statements are both based on my own thinking. He might thinks that there are very many primes at infinity, I don't know for sure.

Look, I am not saying his mathematical musing are not cranckish. But recognize that Archimedes Plutonium is to cranck science as Isaac Newton is to mainstream science. He has seen futher than others even though he stands on the shoulders of no-one. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Questioning minor 1st paragraph edits?
Re: John Roberts, John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Samuel Alito, Sandra Day O'Connor
This is a small matter.  I don't understand the reasons for 's recent minor edits of articles about each of the Justices of the Supreme Court.  After some time, there has been no response to inquiries posted on this editor's talk page nor has there been feedback from similar postings on the talk pages of each of the nine articles about a sitting Justice and the one about retired Justice O'Connor.  Rather than simply reverting this """"improvement,"""" I thought it best to solicit comment from others who might be interested. I found your name amongst others at Talk:Supreme Court of the United States.

I'm persuaded that 's strategy of introducing academic honors in the first paragraph is unhelpful in this narrow set of articles  that is, in Wikipedia articles about Justices of the Supreme Court. I think my reasoning might well extend as well to others on the Federal bench.

The question becomes: Would the current version of the Wikipedia article about any one of them  or either pair  be improved by academic credentials in the introductory paragraph?  I think not.

Perhaps it helps to repeat a wry argument Kathleen Sullivan of Stanford Law makes when she suggests that some on the Harvard Law faculty do wonder how Antonin Scalia avoided learning what others have managed to grasp about the processes of judging?  I would hope this anecdote gently illustrates the point. 

Less humorous, but an even stronger argument is the one Clarence Thomas makes when he mentions wanting to return his law degree to Yale.

As you can see, I'm questioning relatively trivial edit; but I hope you agree that this otherwise plausible """"improvement"""" should be removed from introductory paragraphs of ten articles.  If not, why not?

9e80ca14ba197367,"Are you even listening to me? In 1838, the Armenian Oblast (Armenian province) population was numbering of about 165,000 people according to statistics, about half were Armenian(excluding the later 200,000 on its seroundings who later immigrated). In 1924 the population of Azerbaijan was of 2 million, 75% were Azeri Tartars, it compromised of Baku province , Elizavetpol Province and the adjoining districts, (including Nagorno Karabakh and Nakhochevan). From 250-300,000 Armenians were moved from Julfa, Erivan and Nakhichevan in 1604 and following, if you claim that there was even as much Muslim there, you are totally ignoring the history of the period. Since the partial control by the Ottoman, Nakhichevan and Erivan served as depots of goods, intermedary from the Ouest and East, Persia even further pushed that but replaced the Armenians who would rather trade on the Shah's capital. You claim having provided data, but you have provided absolutly nothing, because the only things you have provided, even before I covered them, and what you present in no way contradict what you claim. A projection of that much people (250-300,000), to claim that Tartars at least presented that much in the Western zone, would have been just sensless.

What I have provided.

1-That there were reasons specifically targetting Armenians which do not apply and were not applied to Muslims.

2-I have provided materials excluding the Muslims in reference to the depopulation.

3-I have provided materials equating the population with the word Armenian.

4-I have provided a reference prior to Gultestan Treaty, and you dismissed the author, while in Wikipedia we only present sources and if there exist critics from notable published materials of those sources. What you think of the author is original research.

You answered by presenting 13-14th century and post Gulestan materials, which in no way have I contested nor do they contradict what I have been saying. I have provided figures of Armenian moved, which by projection represent 2 million or more Armenians if projected for 1918, and those excludes the recorded numbers of Armenians who escaped depopulation and inspite of it, there still remained a considerable number of Armenians pre Gulestan, which I also documented. I have documented everything I have been claiming, you request things that do not exist, because there was no Nakhochevan delimitation in that period, nor statistics for a bordering which is quite modern in comparaison to Abbas period.

In short, what you have highlighted is that the word Armenian has no place in this article, and that you have no intention to improve it. You know that what you propose is misleading but you still claim it is neutral. As we speak 98% of Nakhichevan population is Azeri, so claiming depopulation could only be misleading in that it suggest that Azeris were those moved when the Armenians were those mostly affected. Obviously here, we do have a problem, and as it appears, you in no way want to correct it.  (ix)",0,0,0,0,0,0
71d280f52f349463,"Úbeda 

Hello, sorry for the long message.

In March 2005, there was a WP:RM request and vote (which you took part in) to move Úbeda to Ubeda, with a 6-3 result, see  Talk:Ubeda#Requested_move:_.C3.9Abeda_.E2.86.92_Ubeda (or perhaps here if renamed).

However, beginning in April 2005 and lasting several months, there was a survey conducted at Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (use English)#Proposal and straw poll regarding place names with diacritical marks, with dozens of participants voting and discussing over an extended period of time.  The purpose of the survey was to try to gather feedback for what the policy should be globally.  Proponents of diacritics were in the majority, and in general, use of diacritics is widespread in actual practice on Wikipedia today (particularly since the Mediawiki upgrade to Unicode).

However, for Úbeda/Ubeda, Philip Baird Shearer is stating that the WP:RM vote takes precedence over the survey results, and a new WP:RM vote would be required to move it to Úbeda.  My position is that there should be a global policy rather than case-by-case voting  that was the whole purpose of the survey.  In discussion with him, I wrote:
Just as we wouldn't have case-by-case voting on, say, capitalization issues for articles (eg, prepositions in movie and book titles should be lowercase, globally), we shouldn't have case-by-case voting on diacritic issues.
See the discussion at Talk:Ubeda#Talk_page_discussion_on_page_move (or perhaps here if renamed).

As a possible alternative to calling a new WP:RM vote which might set a precedent for case-by-case voting across thousands of articles, I am polling all the participants of the original WP:RM vote to ask:
 Regardless of how you voted in the WP:RM voting, which do you believe should take precedence: the earlier WP:RM vote on the specific article, or the subsequent survey?

Note, since Philip Baird Shearer was one of the participants in that vote, he will also be receiving this message and thus will have the opportunity to respond.",0,0,0,0,0,0

90e0a235104be6e1,"Invitation to workshops on Wikipedia editing
Dear Ploversegg,

We are a team of researchers at the University of Oxford and AU Sharjah, researching the experiences of editors of content about the Arab world on Wikipedia. We are interested in your experiences of editing Wikipedia and are organising two events that we think you would be an excellent contributor to.

First, starting next week on Monday 27th August, we are hosting an online discussion about what it is like to contribute to Wikipedia in Arabic and to articles about the Middle East and North Africa. We are interested in what barriers you perceive to exist in Wikipedia, how articles can be made better and generally what can be done to expand and improve Arabic Wikipedia. This discussion will take place on a MediaWiki hosted at our institution and be available in English and Arabic. We will allow users to create their own discussion pages in addition to our discussions.

Second, we are hosting face-to-face workshops in Cairo from 21st-22nd October 2012. If you are interested in this we may be able to pay your travel and accommodation costs depending on where you live. This workshop will cover similar themes to the online discussion but will allow participants to meet one another and benefit from being together.  

We will take care of the organization and planning and all you have to do is show up and be ready to discuss. But if you would like to help shape some of the discussion themes in advance, please let us know. We have booked time in the workshops for Wikipedian-led discussions.  

More details can be found in our “Frequently Asked Questions” section below. 

We would be delighted to welcome you to either (or both) event. Please let me know (wikiproject@oii.ox.ac.uk) if you would like to participate and we can send you more details.

Sincerely,

Frequently Asked Questions:
 
What is the purpose of this project?

This project is about who represents the Arab World on Wikipedia, and how the Middle East and the Arab world is represented on Wikipedia. We are studying Wikipedia through statistics, edit  history data and personal experiences. Our ultimate goal is to help Wikipedia grow in size and fairness and do academic research on this topic. You can read more about the project here: http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/?id=70 From this page, you can also find a biography of the researchers. You may also want to see our interactive visualizations about Wikipedia here: http://wikiproject.oii.ox.ac.uk/ 

Who is funding this project?

This project is funded by the International Development Research Centre (http://www.idrc.ca). This organization is funded by the Canadian government to improve infrastructure across the world, including online content. We have been working with the IDRC since June 2010. 

Why did you contact me?

Because you’re awesome. In all seriousness, we have been looking through Wikipedia for active editors based on user activity in either Arabic Wikipedia or articles about the Arab world. We have not contacted everyone we could, but we contact people that we think will help to balance the discussion and help us (and each other) learn more about the state of Wikipedia.  

Do I need to participate in both events?

Not at all. You are welcome to participate in both or just one. We recognise that it will be more convenient for some people to have online conversations and for others to speak in person. For some people it will not be practical to fly to the Middle East, but we still consider their contributions important and want to give them a voice in this work.

Can I use my Wikipedia handle in the online discussion?

You do not need to use any particular name on the online forum. All we need is a valid email address so you can register. You can post using your real name, your Wikipedia name or a completely different nickname, whatever allows you to speak your mind most effectively. 

What sort of travel funding will you supply for the face-to-face workshop?

We have funding for travel and accommodation costs for approximately twenty participants depending on where they are coming from. If you would like to join us in one of the face-to-face meetings then we wi",0,0,0,0,0,0
2e0fbb88e24c1b12,"The facts 

For anyone that has further trouble with troublemakers as I have, consider the following from the wikipedia rules (such as http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Vandalism) in your rebuttal (or just ignore them!):

Making bold edits:
    Wikipedians often make sweeping changes to pages in order to improve them - most of us aim to be bold when updating articles. While having large chunks of text you've written removed or substantially rewritten can be frustrating, simply making edits that noticeably alter the text or content of a pages should not be immediately labeled vandalism.

Talk page vandalism
    Removing the comments of other users from talk pages other than your own, aside from removing internal spam, vandalism, etc. is generally considered vandalism. Removing personal attacks is often considered legitimate, and it is considered acceptable to archive an overly long talk page by creating an archive page and moving the text from the main talk page there. The above rules do not apply to a user's own talk page, where this policy does not itself prohibit the removal and archival of comments at the user's discretion. Please note, though, that removing warnings from one's own talk page is often frowned upon.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Shannon summarized the situation very well. No one is asking your trio to leave out polyandry and such things. What we asked you is to give equal importance to other things as well (Things for which the Nairs are actually famous for). We were the ones who posted """"properly-cited texts"""" and added good citations. But you specifically picked one or two of the points out of a hundred plus and  modified it in such a manner that it lost the original meaning. Each and everyone outside your trio has agreed to the fact that you are the ones who are having POV issues and OR.

Never do business with this bank.  It's not the real Wachovia bank anymore.  First Union, which has always been a bad bank, bought out Wachovia so that it could change its name.  First Union had a terrible reputation for incompetence and fraud, whereas Wachovia had a spotless reputation.

Think about it.  First Union was easily 100 times bigger than Wachovia.  Why would such a company abandon its brand for a virtually unknown brand name unless it was caught hurting its customers so often that its reputation was dismal?  It is just like ValueJet renaming itself after that company killed a plane load of people because they wanted to make an extra buck transporting volatile materials.

I personally lost money due to Wachovia letting my personal information be stolen.  There are tens of thousands of Wachovia bank account holders who had their personal information, including social security numbers and bank account numbers, stolen.  Do not trust this bank.

And the women should be given more leeway regarding this issue compared to the men anyway, as they don't wrestle nearly as many matches as the guys do (1 diva match - MAYBE 2 if they're lucky - per card)

I've always found the """"messenger"""" explanation for the outcome of the 2000 and 2004 elections to be unconvincing.

On the other hand, I don't find Newt Gingrich or George Bush to be particularly compelling orators either. (Although Newt can be very interesting to listen to in smaller venues, particularly since he left office). And yet both had a high degree of political success - until Bush foundered when the Iraq war turned into a disaster. This goes back to my original point - the policy basis for both parties is more or less the same now as it has been since '92, because at their core the parties are have hardly changed. All that has been altered are details of communication and appeal. The idea that significant change is coming in either party has regularly proven to be untrue - losing elections has not seemed to presage major change.

 Dealing with Geaves' trustworthiness as a Rawat scholar 

Rather than get into another reversion war, I'll do it this way.  I propose posting the same paragraph I put up the other day.  Obviously, you premies don't like it but the fact is, it's apparent beyond question that Geaves has misrepresented the truth about Rawat's role in the Millenium hype.

Geaves said:

In November 1973, Divine Light Mission had booked the Houston Astrodome, a large sports stadium with a capacity of 90,000.  The event had taken on millenial expectations in the U.S.  with devotees announcing and advertising Maharaji's appearance at the stadium as a second-coming, complete with angelic and alien visitors.  Only 20,000 attended the event and Maharaji did not appear to have any knowledge of his American followers' expectations.  He spoke as he usually does at such gatherings with no hint of messianic promises.

Whereas, in a broadly-disseminated letter to all his followers, Rawat described the upcoming program as the """"most Holy and significant event in human history"""", intimated that the festival wasn't just for him and his followers but the whole world, """"and maybe the whole universe"""" and suggested that it was time for his followers to help him """"bring peace to this Earth.""""

Any fair reader can clearly see the serious discrepancy between Geaves' account and the documentary evidence.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Courts: I have been putting all articles dealing with state law and state courts and their judges under the 'foo law' sub-category for each US 'foo' state.  This at least puts everything involving law and its administration in one place.  While the courts are of course part of 'government', in some states their articles were so dominating the government category, that the executive and legislative articles were losing out.  I can certainly see putting a 'see also' notice at the top of each 'government of foo' category to point to the 'foo law' category. 

Communications: Communications, of course, encompasses media, and also telephone (area codes) and mail (zip codes) and internet, etc.  I see no differenece to be made at the US level versus the state level.  Not sure that media is of such overwhelming

Notes for the blind communist Castro lovers editing wikipedia and for the man himself

There seems to be a group of people around here in wikipedia with very strong leftist tendency that are very blind as to no recognize Castro for what he is. But not to worry. History will take care of him like it took care of Hitler and Stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer.
There is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral POV but there is no such thing here. All the Castro's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free vacations by the dictator at Varadero beach in Cuba while many true Cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing Castro and what he represents. A decadent regime, a waste of time for the Cuban people. 
Castro I know you or your agents will read this. So do not worry. History will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here. 
You could have been great a great leader if you had help Cuba get out of a dictator like Batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy! 
But you want to know something. You became worst than Batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution. You yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power. 
You claim Cuba is the most democratic country in the world. 

""""Right""""!How many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands? How many desperate people abandon the  island? Because there is no other choice? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime, controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia. Cleaning up your image! 
It amazes me. Because this goes to show what you are. A megalomaniac! too worry about what history will tell about you, about what your legacy will be.
Do not worry Fidel Castro. I will let you know this. Do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as Jose Marti, Feliz Varela or even a Simon Bolivar. 
You do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact I can tell you that you go down for miles and miles.  
You must be full of envy about Chavez! because his got the oil money you never had! and because of it he can buy some people. But do not be! Some people are not for sale. Some people will not buy the lies you sell.
This is for you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, and who fantasize about Castro and Che I will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you Castro that you are not  even at Che's level, yes the same one you made a martyr, an icon of the revolution, Your first patron saint. The same one you sell in t-shirts and postcards now and you profit from! 
That is because at least Che had principles, something you really do not know what it is or even fathom, 
he(Che) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth, while on the other hand you Castro  just used it for your own personal benefit and profit.

Ask yourself why Che die? why Camilo Cienfuegos die? and many others close to power in Cuba?

Many people said that Castro himself send someone to kill him! He just can not stand someone close to power(because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it,obsess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones. Poor guys, I am sorry for them. 
 
Castro have subjugated and dominated the Cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants. But no more.. Just like everything that is born some day you too Fidel Castro will also die sooner or later. Do not worry, when you die we the Cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone. Sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry. Cuba will be rebuild. All the Cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in vane. You know why that will be? Because, Cubans will have learn their lesson. 

For you, all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime, believe me if you impartially read all the news about Fidel Castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution. How power have corrupted him and his regime. How many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution? how much intolerance! how many times he has sell out his """"principles"""".

War crimes are serious violations of the laws of war.  The key words here are """"laws"""" and """"war.""""  Unless one lives in a corrupt town, laws are made by legislatures, or in this case ratified by them, after being written and argued over by diplomats in consultation with their military's generals.  The laws of war were written with the understanding that killing large numbers of people may be a legitimate and necessary part of that process.

Its a delicious honour to be blocked from you feral ninnys.  TY for the compliment.  I just edit on Help.com but really, what a waste of time editing anywhere, especially when no one pays for the effort.

Ensure Dame Sarah reads this below the obvious delusional it is.  No one presumes to that extent unless the need some help.

[edit] Gundagai
Ms Gundagai, normally I would be thrilled to be the centre of so much attention (so far all your edits, except those to your userpage, have been devoted to me), but article talk pages are for discussing the article, not for making personal attacks on other users. If you wish to give me feedback, I would be most interested to read it. The appropriate place for such postings is my userpage, not article or project space.
If you truly object to editors """"fiddling...and inteferring with some else's words,"""" then you might want to consider whether Wikipedia is the right place for you. Every time you make an edit, you acknowledge acceptance that your edits may be edited any number of times by any number of people. At the bottom of each edit page is this statement: """"If you don't want your writing to be edited mercilessly or redistributed by others, do not submit it.""""
I strongly caution you about continuing to make personal attacks on other users. The community condemns personal attacks, and should you choose to continue making them, it will result in further and longer range blocks. It's very easy to avoid such blocks by simply commenting on article content instead of editors. I'm sure we can all work together constructively and productively if we refrain from making comments about other users.
I am very pleased that you now have an account and I think this is a sign of good faith on your behalf. So thankyou for that. I hope we are able to get these issues resolved so you may be able to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia. Sarah Ewart (Talk) """"""",1,0,0,0,0,0

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you """"liars""""; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:

 QUOTED: """"I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.   

 QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as """"1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression."""" First of all, """"all editors have reached a consensus on the article"""" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others """"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system"""", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with """"- For a start,"""" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!  And again I made the distinction in """"the clearest possible words"""" when I proposed here, as my first(!) point in an suggested outline,  Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#Suggested_outline.2C_please_consider_and_discuss """"differentiate a specific numeral script (eg, Arabic Western, Arabic Eastern, Devanagari) from the numeral system (ie, Indian-Arabic, which includes many numerals scripts), the rest of the article should maintain this, it should also keep in mind what the readers may have searched for when looking up this article and cater for those needs (eg, is the reader looking up the Arabic Western numerals script or the Indian-Arabic Numeral system?)"""", and then again zocky, who prefers my version and is against yours, made the same disctinction Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#What_this_page_is_about. The dictionary defines a liar as """"One that tells lies"""" and """"a person who has lied or who lies repeatedly"""", if you want me to stop calling pointing out your lies stop lying! csssclll ()""""

 In addition, I did *not* start the POV fork (Alternative views on Arabic numerals). 

 In addition, you are being misleading and also lying about the following """"I replied to his comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, and at 22:08, asked him on Talk:Arabic numerals to respond to my comment at Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8.

Archangel White Tiger:

A few words, meow:

Oh, so I was banned for quoting the Torah! Excellent, the admins here are banning for """"personal attack on gays"""", when you recite The Words of The G-d, but no one was banned for saying, that holocaust victims were gays and gypsies! More than six million people died in holocaust just because they were Jews, the statement at which I got angered is was of accusing martyrs in concentration camps in sodomy, which IS one of the greatest sins, according to BIBLE - Old Testament, TaNaKh and the New Testament, B’rit Chadashah of Messiah Yeshua Ben Elochim, Jesus Christ the Son of G-d, that Ta Bu Shi Da Yu never tried to read... These are pure actions of anti-Semitic and Heretic propaganda, some sort of modern faschism...

For the last words (and I'm outta here) I will recite Bible... The reason I was banned is for """"surely"""" confirming these Words:

Leviticus 20:13

""""If there is a man who lies with a male as those who lie with a woman, both of them have committed a detestable act; they shall surely be put to death. Their bloodguiltiness is upon them.""""

Cash I am a walmart assocate and I do feel there is a link between Walmart managment and servant leadership, and here is why. The managers are not in charge of the store, the hourly associates are, they take orders directly from the customers. The customers are consitered under walmarts policies to be the boss, the hourly assocates are next in that order and so on. This is a backwards model that was set fourth by Sam Walton himself and is maintained by the current board. Grassroots survays are conducted every 3mos to a year, this survey is a rating of each manager, and is then reviewed by the district and Regional VP, then changes are made. Each level of management must answer to the hourly assocates, and so it is kinda a push/pull managment system. Take my own situation for an example. heres what happend, one night I am short of assocates in the deli(which is where I work) Temp logs did not get done, of course this is a major mistake, I was """"written up"""" for this. However I did not feel this was fair, so I wrote an email to our district manager explaining the situation, he then forwarded the matter to our regional VP. Our VP came to our store, flew in from bentonville mind you. To deal with the situation, he met with me for about an hour and also met with some other deli assocates. After a week he calls me and tells me that he can not get rid of the Written warning, however that all of the managers that had been informed that we where short, would be on probation for the next six months. I was satisfied with the outcome Because, While I was not fault free in the situation, management however was informed that I did not have enough people to help customers and deal with the food safty logs, and they failed to act accordingly and I was not happy with it, so in the end I punished them for their poor perfomance. So you can kinda see why they consiter it a servant leadership. 

Also Cash I hate the way you term 'vast left-wing conspiracy' I am myself a liberal and we liberals are not part of that conspiracy ideal, that would be your union leaders and right-wing large business owners, that are anti-walmart, As much as you would like to identify us liberals with the unions we are in no way assocated with them, infact most of us liberals dislike the unions just as much if not more then you right-wingers. Because the general public tends to identify unions with the democratic party and this is because most union voters, vote on the liberal side, this does not mean that they are liberals, just that they play the politics game. True liberals hate the unions and feel that they are just as bad or worse then a currupt big business. With a currupt big business atleast you know what they are and they make no bones about it, with a union they want to be your friend and then screw you. lol.

On the part about this entry being POV it is very much so POV however I have given up tring to balance it out myself the Anti-Walmart people always revert your edit and then threaten to get you banned for the three revert rule when you attempt to make any edits, its a freaking joke the way they act.

 DON'T ARGUE WITH THAT FARRAKHANISTIC MORON 

  Why do you argue with that Farrakhan?? Ignore that moron, he doesn't know any better. Around 51% percent of DR is Mulatto(euro/black)or mixed and 46% Black. The mixed population lives mainly in the North,also known as the Cibao, while the Blacks are from the South like Sammy Sosa. This guy  is a believer of """" one-droppism"""", hyperdecent"""". So forget about convincing this fool. It is like a religion, it is very hard to convert somebody from one into another. 

  Northern Dominicans aka Cibaeños know who they are, they don't need these idiots to tell them what are they or what they are.  This idiot doesn't know jack about our history. There are ignorant people in every nationality, granted, but that doesn't give license to generalize an entire nationlaity based on the reactions of some people.  I'm Dominican, nobody has ever called me Black, even in the redneck deep south, even thou I do have Black blood, due to the fact that my family is not racist and some intermarrired with dark mulattoes.  Anyways, ignore these idiots,look how he is bad-mouthing white people. white people have done lots of evil, true, but this idiot wouldn't even be talking garbage thru this computer if it wasn't for this invention from the white man in the first place. That's just to tell you about his pea-sized brain.

   Hey Einstein, when did I say anything anti-africanist here?? please point it out for me. I'm even against the CIA sources that some people wanted to place on the article here, the one about 73% mulatto,16% white and 11% black.  Do you think that I'm going to be crazy enough to believe DR is only 11% Black??  I'll be too ashamed of saying such a thing.  I agree on you on that one. 51% mulatto, 46% black, 2% white is the real demographic approximates of DR. Where is the """" denial, anti-black, blaha blah and all the non-sense accusations that you are making by me saying that??
   I stated an increase from 11% that somebody else place here from CIA to 46%, that's an increase of 35. So I am the anti-black, racist,denier??? 

   I knew that you where going to throw the """" Moor myth"""" about Spaniards, you are showing the radical afrocentric nut. What's next? you also believe in Van Sertima's book, that the Olmec heads of the Yucatan peninsula are Africans? or that snow is really black??
   DNA studies in Spaniards show that less than 2% have Moor blood. It has been weed out,since the fall of Cordova in 1236, by the """" limpieza de sangre"""" campaign of the christians. Spaniards are White as are the anglo-saxons,and the Irish. I'm not going into deep details about """" Moors and Spain"""" with a radical Afrocentric nut, but going back to the article, we are not going to allow that the DR article is going to get hijack by radical afrocentric nut, nor eurocentric too. As you can see, I'm not eurocentric, 16% white to 2% white, do the math.

History shows many flaws with your editing/disruptive/blocking/conflict-resolution/reverting style, but right/wrong/indifferent, I think you should dismiss yourself from this project for a period of time.

How do I know? I think you know over the years with just me alone as I've used multiple IPs/user names in the past and you were always the trouble maker, the only one until Jake came along on John Ritter's article. Neither of you can be told what you do wrong, you have to have your way (don't say you're doing what Wikipedia wants because you've both been in violation many times without any punishment).

Again, you disgusting cretin, you accuse my statements of being laughable, yet have no logical basis to believe so. You think I believe my arguments are gospel, eh? So you're the kind of person who believes that if everybody believes something, then you should go along with them? So you're the kind of sick bastard that would've condoned slavery just because everybody you knew did? I do not at all think my arguments are gospel, I just proudly stand by my word until a logical argument will present a sensical contradiction. You're the bastard who has some sort of personal agenda attatched to this and for some reason or another, you refuse to have it changed, like a no-good dirty hippocrite.

Dude, sorry for the rough language, but you are one fucking dumbass idiot. Everything I type is extremely intelligible and free-flowing, if you will, yet you seem to interpret it WAY differently than it is obviously stated. My sentence, """"You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so"""", makes perfect sense and only an idiot would not understand it. I wrote it redundantly to prove a point, not because I lack verbal skills. The point being, that you are an idiot and you can't understand the symbolic (or even literal) nature of my posts, and you interpret it into something that somehow benefits you and your cozy little world view. Ok, this will be the 100TH time I've had to clear something up for you, but let me tell you what this sentence means:

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

If you discerned something other than this, than you are retarded, hands down. I can't understand why you make all these radical interpretations, especially when most of my words are plainly visible. I am in NO WAY contradicting myself here, and if you can't understand this, then I am in NO WAY going to argue with the mentally retarded, for the guilt would prevent me from having peace of mind for quite some time.

About the Standard English, obviously, this article was written by a British person, and is extremely POV, thus is not a valid argument against this issue. That's like basing all your knowledge about drugs on government and anti-drug propaganda. 

Please man, let's put some sense into this argument, and remove all the non-sensical bullcrap you've included into. And don't ever, EVEr fucking tell me to go away, got it? People who back out of arguments are always wrong. They do that because they have no more to say on their behalf, and are afraid to """"join"""" the opposing persuasion.""",1,0,0,0,0,0

The band promotes Croatian patriotism and ultra-nationalism, and sings about topics such as the love for one's country, family and religion, but also about the hatred of Serbs and Croatian social democrats. Dealing with such topics has made the band controversial. Perković has been known to openly promote Ustaša ideology because he wears black clothes, salutes in the corresponding way and had often openly supported the Ustaše and the NDH in his statements to the media. 

Ultra-nationalism?Ultra-nationalism means that you want to destroy everything that is not of your nation.While patriotism means that you love your own nation,but you respect others.Where in his songs does he promote hate to other nations?And no mentioning songs created in time of war against the Serbs,because it was the time of war.And only mention songs written by him.Not what he is accused of performing.

 Hatred toward SDP?Where?Name source.He is right wing,that si widely known.Of course he disagrees with their politics and he considers their politics bad for Croatia,but hatred? Reliable source please.

Where does he promote openly Ustashe?Citation please.Because he wears black clothes?Are all rockers Ustashe?By this,rock 'n' roll is equal fascism.He is a rock singer,of course he wears black clothes.
Salute he uses is an old salute of Croatian nobles,that existed long before Ustashe.

Despite this, his statements confirming his support for the Ustaše actually outnumber his denouncements of this virtual NSDAP equivalent (he is noted to have publicly voiced his support for the NDH, in various degrees, to the media on at least twenty occasions). His credibility in these statements is diminished not only by this fact but also by the legal necessity to denounce any fascist movement in order to avoid further banning (or other legal action).

Again,I see that this is already discussed.Feral is not reliable,its a tabloid.Only reliable newspapers should be used.And these quotations in Feral,while they may be true,there are no links to check the meaning,because they may be taken out of contest,and they could have totally fifferent meaning ii their original contest.This is not reliable.

And one more question.A couple of months ago I translated two Perkovic's statements in Jutarnji list and Vecernji list.I've put relevant sources,links to that articles.And a picture was there also.Someone deleted all this without giving explanation on the discussion page.This is not what wikipedia is about.Any change must be explained.Shame on anyone who uses this kind of sneaky methods.",1,0,0,0,0,0

God damn, it doesn't matter IF I DO provide proof. As you will put a pro-russian spin on it anyway.

The reason this pro-russian bias on this article keeps reoccuring is because Ymblanter is an admin and possibly other pro-russian admins are allowing this. Also, your lack of understanding of a Neutral Point of View doesn't help either.

Tricky situatian you got yourself into here, shame that I don't have the time or the motivation to meddle is pointless discussions with people who are brainwashed into thinking that they have nothing to do with Crimea by their own government.

2690ef334051ceb8,"""Saab lofton was a radio personality for about two months of his before loosing his show on digital radio network. He will not provide proof of his comic roofis (as in did he actuall draw it himself or did he contract out the work while writing the storie. Both of his books (pamplets) are home published and could be considered very racist! This is not someone that has any creditibily as he has lied several times on his wikipedia page.

No RESULTS!
On June 12th, 2008 GLOBETREKER says:
This is not an example and cannot be proven that YOU actually drew THE strip.

Like I said I have been informed this comic in nothing more than 2 or 3 sheets of zerox paper stapled together. Not in the usual format as a printed affair. He uses the term loosely since it’s not a real printed comic. He has no examples of his drawing, what kind of cartoonist doesn’t put their work online. PROVE THAT SHIT!

He stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006

http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l

“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. 

(Example #1 of his lies)

2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.
The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.

“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”

When in reality

“Lofton wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.

(Example #2 of his lies)

I ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!

(Example #3 of his lies)

“In all the WEEKS you've been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, """"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?""""”.

I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!

Here’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!

I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as """"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair"""". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don't appear to establish notability either.

Therefore I am proposing deletion of the article. If the tag is remove, would someone please nominate for deletion? I can't as I can't create the deletion page... 67.67.219.223 (talk) 

I'll keep an eye on it. I also find it a little hard to believe that he was kicked out of San Francisco State for writing a novel that was """"too radical."""" -) Steve Dufour (talk)

 BLACK DAHLIA MURDER IS NOT 'MELODIC DEATH METAL'!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! THEY ARE DEATHCORE PUSSIES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Black Dahlia Murder IS NOT Melodic Death Metal. They are the farthest band from that genre. Black Dahlia Murder are pieces of shit scene bitches that are trying to be """"METAL"""" along with all of the other Deathcore/Grindcore bands like Job For A Cowboy, Suicide Silence, etc. Fuck all of them! They aren't true Metal and they never will be, they need to stick to what they know...American Eagle, MTV, and all of their other lame trends. Melodic Death Metal is Scar Symmetry, In Flames, Sonic Syndicate, and Disarmonia Mundi. Melodic Death Metal is REAL music, it's not a disgrace to music like Deathcore and Grindcore.

I will continue to change Black Dahlia CUNT'Murder's genre to Deathcore/Grindcore, I don't give a shit..I'm not letting you stupid scene bitches take away the only thing that you and the Mainstream hasn't destroyed and that's the amazing genre of Melodic Death Metal. So fuck all of you trendy conformists, go fucking die.

Black Dahlia Murder are Deathcore pussies that need to be beheaded, them and all of the other Deathcore bands that are ruining Metal.

Deathcore is the biggest piece of shit I've ever heard...it shouldn't even be considered music, it's a bunch of pussy scene kids trying to be """"METAL"""". Deathcore and Grindcore are the two worst forms of music ever invented.

So yeah, you can listen to Deathcore if you enjoy hearing """"music"""" that has no tempo or beat to it whatsoever, they pretty much just hit random shit on the drums and play random notes on the Guitar while the vocalist does terrible random screaming and pig squels. Don't forget the hillarious millions of breakdowns they put into their songs.

""""DA...THIS SONG IS CALLED BIG FUCKING TREE!""""

""""Ya boi....we are so down wit American Eagle..ya boi, my hair does that flippy thing.. RAWR RAWR RAWR I'M SO LYK HARDCORES OMGZ@!!!@@!!!! GAGES AND SNAKE BITES RAWWWRRR""""

Fuck Job for a Cowboy and Black Dahlia Murder, trendy pieces of shit.

Melodic Death Metal owns all. 

There really isn't much of a difference between any """"Deathcore"""" band for that matter, they are all just a bunch of pussies that are trying to fit in with this new trend of trying to be a """"Metal"""" band.

So please don't try to tell me """"OH...YOUR STUPID...THE BANDS AREN'T THE SAME.""""

Ok, so maybe....JUST MAYBE.. Job For A Cowboy's vocalist does 3 more pig squels in a second than the vocalist from Black Dahlia Murder, there I said it! I guess they aren't all the same!!!! Oh dear fuck ..... And my bad...my bad, White Chapel actually does 200 breakdowns in a minute rather than Suicide Silence's 100 breakdowns in a minute. My bad dude you were right all along!! Deathcore and Grindcore bands aren't all the same!!!!!!!!!

But seriously, the genre is pure shit and is just another trend in the music industry that bands are following to """"make it to the top"""" and to fit in with the rest of the bands these days.

I mean, I have nothing against every band in a certain genre sounding the same or anything, but when the """"music"""" of the genre they produce is pure shit and can be done by any living human being on Earth...then I have to draw the line. It doesn't take much talent to do shittty raw screaming, hit random notes on a guitar, and hit your double bass pedal at like 500bpm.

Another reason why I don't take any bands from this genre seriously is their hillarious excuses for a """"band logo"""".

They try oh so hard to be """"HARDDCOREEEEE"""".

I also find it funny that all of these pussy bands have names like, """"ANAL CUNT"""" or """"DEAD DEATH BLOODY DEAD HAND"""".

Fact is, any band that produces """"music"""" under this genre sucks and is just trying to fit-in.

YA BOI! LETS HARDCORE DANCE! RAHHHH YAAAAAA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Grindcore and Deathcore isn't Metal so all you douchebags should just give up....you aren't Metal and you never will be, go fall into a pool of AID's. 

Fuck Black Dahlia Murder, I'm not giving up....this is insane, I'm not letting you mother fuckers take away the one thing I have that you haven't ruined.""",1,0,1,0,1,0

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_talk:Citations_missing#Inline_citations_are_not_required_by_policy

1. Inline citations are not required by policy

No policy requires inline citations. They are often a good idea, and are a requirement for feature article status, but it is not a requirement for all articles. Furthermore, the tag is often used when the article has adequate sources. This tag therefore enshrines a particular editor's view about style (that the article in question should have inline citations) in an inappropriate way. That point belongs on the talk page, not in the article itself. Robert A.West (Talk) 

    Where does it say that featured articles have different requirements then other articles? Jeepday 

        The whole point in to get citations for all articles so that they meet the WP:V requirements, I have noticed that tags quite often help by bringing this to attention of users, particularly new-ish users. Cheers SeanMack 

            I agree with Jeepday and SeanMack. Our ultimate goal should be for every article to be of FA quality.  Satori Son 

                That goal is not consensus among editors. But more importantly, inline citations for every fact are not an FA requirement; see WP:FA? section 1c. CMummert · talk

Too bad Sister Mary Lou isn't available to teach a few intensive lessons on tolerance to the campaign people of presidential candidate John Edwards. Within the last few weeks, two bloggers for the former North Carolina senator resigned after being hit with criticism from conservative Catholic organizations angered by past anti-Catholic remarks the bloggers posted on the Web, according to CNN. Melissa McEwan and Amanda Marcotte quit after groups like the Catholic...

Suprisingly - or not - at least one individual whose statements are featured in that archive ( and also in collections of antisemitic rhetoric ) is also leader of a prominent Christian right group that claims to fight against anti-Catholic bias and discrimination who...

To all the vandals and so called just administrators, the air dates are minor problems, the facts and details surrounding Reeves suicided are not being written well enough, as everybody else is reporting, the fact that Reeves was to fight Moore next day, is also being reverted, this is pure vandalism. As far as spelling goes by Vesa or Projects or whoever, well, if you keep on repeating yourself and have no time, some spelling errors might occur, but it's not the spelling that counts but content which is being vandalised by so called just users and administrators of this so called just wikipedia. And it is obvious wahkeenah has some personal interest in this, proof: All over internet we have Reeves' death explained in detail and possible people involved, but over here he is taking everything down, the idiotic administratotors are reversing it, thus making themselves look stupid and ignorant by not realizing the historical facts.""",1,0,0,0,0,0

no seriousy.  the only thing i think actually did or said against your precious wikipedia policies was saying that """"if i really had my way, half of you would be shot"""".  ignoring for a while the fact that i was obviously joking, it happens to be my religious belief that the human race on a whole would be much, much better off if 95% of the population died tomorrow.  that doesn't mean i go around killing people, or making specific death threats against individuals.  and don't you actually have the sense to realize that if someone says """"OH MY GOD YOU ARE SUCH A FUCKING IDIOT, JUST GO DIE ALREADY"""" that they probably don't want you to die, or more accurately they don't care.  Very few people actually have the emotion required to sit and pray for the death of another person or group of people.  And I am not one of those people.

If you really wanted to show off what a horrible and insensitive person I am,  edit, which was on a wiki talk page, is probably not the best.  Granted, nothing pisses me off more than people who see letters like я and щ and automatically assume that whatever is written is Russian.  The Cyrillic alphabet is used in many Slavic languages, as well as central asian former soviet republics, and even Mongolia.  So I called someone an idiot.  BOO FUCKING HOO.  maybe he could have said """"What language is that?"""" instead of assuming that it was Russian.  However insulted he was by me calling him an idiot, I can guarantee you that I was at least 10 times as insulted by him calling that Russian.  I am a proud, native Russian, and will not have my culture besmirched with these allegations.

Your other example how I am a bad contributor is what, a spelling correction?  Or was it the fact that my edit summary was how I felt about the sad fact that niggers can't spell? Don't even think about raising issue of my use of the word.  I live in Harlem.  Around here, that word is used like a comma.  And before you try to tell me the difference between """"nigga"""" and """"nigger"""", there is none.  It's called a dialect.  While for some purposes, it makes sense to write things phonetically as they are pronounced by the person saying them, I find it is usually clearer to spell properly.  Also, a nigger, to me at least, is not a """"black person"""". I am not a racist. I do not even draw distinctions between people. In my holy opinion, there is a nigger inside of all of us.  People (like you, for instance) who take offense for no reason (i mean, was saying """"black people are stupid and i think they should be marginalized in society, tarred and feathered, strung up on trees, dragged through town by their enormous wangs, etc.""""?  No.  And if that is what you heard, I'd like to know why.  Are you black?  98% of the black people I know personally use the word """"nigger"""" more than I do.) are why we as a society still can't get over the silly idea that words are harmful.  Words are not harmful.  Ideas are harmful.  One particularly harmful idea is that certain words are so unspeakably horrible that nobody can be allowed to say them for any reason at all.  You want to end racism forever?  Stop freaking the fuck out every time you see the word """"nigger"""".  SERIOUSLY.  I happen to be a Priest (and a Docktor), and saving humanity is just one of my many responsibilities.  Fucks like you make me hate it, but I still do it.  That's what a good person I am.

I forgot what else I was going to complain about.  I mean, I could complain about everything on Wikipedia, not because I am uncivil, but because there are enough Wikipedos to make this community unbearable for normal, well-adjusted individuals such as myself.  If you look at all my page edits, they were all GOOD FOR THE ENCYCLOPEDIA.  Ok, there was one tiny exception - a long time ago, I saw someone changed a caption on Scottish fold to """"Winston Churchill"""".  Someone else reverted it, and I reverted it back.  I felt it was an appropriate caption to that particular image.  But everything else was beneficial to improving the quality of the content.  I may be a little hard on people who are hung up on things that are wrong, but I only do what is right.  That is why I put it on my user page.  I don't do wrong things.  If you try to argue with me, you will be in for a world of hurt.  Butthurt, to be exact.  But you have nobody to blame but yourself.  Unlike you, I actually warn people first.  But no.  You fags have to be humorless, oversensitive, fascist wikipedos with your unwarranted self-importance and your administrative powers.  Well you can go fuck yourselves.

It turns out, that even after showing TWO admins the info he needed he STILL got banned from an admin named Glen. He told me through MSN...Now I knew that wikipedian's admins were not the BEST on the internet, but after hearing this you guys have to be the most sick, vile people i've ever heard in my life.

I have never used swear words against him but have used descroiptions that are accurate. look at his recent self serving post on rod laver to carlo and his digraceful censorship of my legitimate  comments; he is not a censor or a dictator ' but acts like one; he needs to be brought to heel and your helping him because  your  stopping crticism of him. he is an absoloute disgrace. plenty of people have criticied him but he never, never apologises. its beyond a joke. its war as far as l'm concerned and its being going on for 5 months mate and is not going to stop  until he is broughy to book.

I did not say what you repeatedly say I said. You have several times now said I should be blocked for calling somebody a """"cunt"""". You have repeatedly made false accusations against me without a single time providing a diff. I am well aware of what I have written and where it was written. I have not called you or anybody else such a word anywhere on Wikipedia. The most outrageous thing in the diff in which you were blocked for was not your reference to """"cancer"""". It is your persistence in spreading false and malicious commentary about me. In that diff you say When Nableezy had the balls to say that he knew someone was a sockpuppet but that he was keeping his mouth shut because he likes him it showed that he was here for one reason and one reason only. Post a diff that backs that comment up. Just one, try to find one. Later on you say this time he called people cunts. Could you please provide a diff in which I call people (pl) cunts (pl) or even a person a cunt? Of course you cant, but that doesnt stop you. I dont even care if you are blocked or not, I wanted an admin to make you stop making these outrageous accusations without providing any evidence. Earlier you made several allusions to various people who think I was socking. You back out of it by saying """"Im not the one accusing you, just other unnamed people do"""", as if that allows you to drop such an accusation with out one bit of evidence.The other problems with your comment aside, the accusation that you made that I """"breed cancer"""", that cancer being sockpuppetry, shows only how obsessed you are with directing fault to me. You think I am the reason NoCal or Dajudem socks? Really? I, hoping that I am right, will assume you say this because you are just unaware of the actual history, as opposed to purposely ignoring or distorting it. Much of this happened before my time here, but before I got involved in editing here I read a quite a bit of the history, through article and user talk pages and archives, AfDs, ANI, AE, AN3, ..., and the arbitration cases. So I have a certain familiarity with the actors of this play and know the story fairly well. Once upon a time, there was a user named Isarig. This user has had their account """"vanished"""" to . Some things I dont know, as the user's talk page is deleted, and others dont need to be discussed, but this user vanished at the start of the ARBPIA case. The user already had a history of socking, how much is one of the things I dont know. This happened late 2007/early 2008, with his last edit talking place on Dec 24 2007. NoCal100 was created Jan 3 2008. Canadian Monkey Dec 30 2007. Mr Hicks The III is an older sock, from Sep 2007. There were a few others created back then. All this before this monstrous creature you refer to as Nableezy arrived and caused this man to start socking.Now, as for your BFF (Stellarkid). The account Dajudem was given a topic ban after the CAMERA lobbying issue came to light in April 2008. One month later the Tundrabuggy account was created. One of the first things this account did was to go after, in a purely vindictive manner, one of the admins who had dealt with that issue. She, dishonestly posing as a new editor confused by the rules, was able to game the system into producing several blocks or bans against that admin. She followed him from article to article, going away from the A/I area into random areas such as Persian history. She was able to hide the fact that she was doing this for some time, until she was discovered as Dajudem's sock and blocked. One month later, a new account, Stellarkid, is created. Posing as a new account confused by the rules, this new sock proceeds to do the same thing she did with that earlier admin with a new target (guess who?). She is able to successfully get a ban placed against her target. When this account is discovered to be a sock, a new account (in fact several) was created. Three separate accounts were blocked last time around, including one with no edits just waiting to be put in to use. So Dajudem began socking prior to ever seeing me, yet I am responsible for her continued socking? And NoCal? I am responsible for dozen or so different accounts that I know that he has, and that isnt counting the ones from Isarig? How can you possibly blame me for the fact that a number of die hard members of the Defenders of the Glorious Cause have repeatedly socked?But back to the point, dont make accusations that you cant provide evidence for. Either provide a diff of me calling somebody a """"cunt"""" or retract the charge. Same for the accusation that I knowingly overlooked sockpuppetry because I liked a user. nableezy - """,1,0,1,0,0,0
