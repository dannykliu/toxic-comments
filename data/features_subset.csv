 Long hair shep image 

I've rechecked the old image, and I still don't think it's a good one for the article. Even in full size, the dog is front-on, so only the tufts of fur from the ruff are visible. In a thumbnail the long hair features are not visible at all, and it looks like a poor focused """"generic German Shepherd"""" picture. The picture I replaced it with is side-view. Even in a thumbnail the features are visible, and because it's a side view, the long hair influence is visible on the neck and haunches which is not the case even at high resolution with the older image.

I don't do much image work, but this one was crying out for a better one and has been for ages, to my eyes. Can you take another look at both, and reconsider the full images, and the thumbnail images of each revision, and my comments on these above. Many thanks. FT2 (Talk | email) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Here the most authoritative photo: http://users.servicios.retecal.es/jomicoe/Alconetar.JPG

  El puente de Alconétar, sobre el Tajo  en Garrovillas (Cáceres) cerca de Alcántara, estaba en la Vía de la Plata. Debió de ser también monumental. Fue destruido por los árabes en el siglo XIII y nunca después reconstruido. Hoy día es un puente sin río. Al construir el pantano de Alcántara hubiera quedado sepultado por las aguas. En el año 1972 se trasladaron sus restos a un nuevo emplazamiento. Apenas quedan tres arcos de los 13 que tuvo. Se aprecia su solidez en sus fuertes machones.

 As for the Pons Fabricius, there are some Roman bridges (and even more medieval ones) whose arches are designed somewhere between semi-circular and segmental. This is only natural as a demanding structure the segmental arch bridge could not have been invented in a day, but must have been reasonably the result of a lengthy development process. This means there are certainly transitory forms between the two types, what we need in every single case is the span/rise ratio of the bridge to make qualified judgements on its segmental or semi-circle character.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks for your input on the Pump RE caps.

 Favor. I believe the section is neutral enough to remove the neutral dispute tag. In order of Jefferson to get to GA status the article needs to not have any neutrality disputes. There is criticism of Jefferson for not speaking out on emanicipation during his Presidency, his reluctance to free his slaves, his reliance on slavery to support his aristocratice lifestyle, his rhetoric contradicting his slave ownership, and the Louisiana Purchase treaty increased slavery in the West. Positive statements on Jefferson was that he was a humane slaveowner, mentioning his proposal to stop slavery in the West after 1800, and he banned the United States slave trade. Editors can address any other issues without the neutrality dispute tag. The article does state he manummitted only a few slaves. As far as """"humane"""" that is a matter of subjection.

Are you arguing that was should mention that a number of scientists dissent from evolution in the lead section of Evolution because creationists aren't banned from getting doctorates? That's rather silly indeed.
Creationism is a personal religious belief; it has nothing to do with science. There is no scientific evidence for creationism, and no aspect of creationism has never been supported or verified in any paper submitted to a peer-reviewed scientific paper. The problem here isn't that you're trying to dispute evolution by linking to a Christian website (after all, Christians can do science too); rather, it's that you're trying to dispute evolution by citing people who hold a certain religious belief. Creationism has no more relevance to the field of biology than Mormonism or Hinduism or Trinitarianism does. It is scientifically (and biologically) unremarkable that some people reject scientific facts for religious reasons, and creationism is a religious movement, based on the Book of Genesis in the Bible, not on scientific observations. If you think that the Book of Genesis (or any religious movement based on it) is science, you gravely misunderstand the meaning of """"science"""".
Also, that's an amazingly short list, considering how many millions of people there are with doctorates.. And how many people on that list are actually biologists?
Also, a """"criticisms"""" section is a bad idea, though a related article is currently under construction: Objections to evolution. When it's finished, it should satisfy your desire that this encyclopedic topic be covered.

 Headline text 
Attention: Sandra [[User:69.11.10.188|

When indicating """"passing"""" in your statement above, could you please respond to the following questions re:the various registries you have referenced:

1)What do you mean by """"passing"""". Do the registries disallow breeding of dogs who have higher than your indicated ratings?  How do the registries gather the individual scores of each of their breeding dogs? How do the registries """"enforce"""" these requirements?

2) Could you state what testing organization(s)are accepted by each registry for these """"passing"""" grades?  Your """"grades"""" indicate they are probably OFA scores, but how are Penn-Hip scores treated in the registries, since this testing is also being used with Shiloh Shepherds, from what has been previously mentioned in this discussion?

3) What are your references for your gathered information; that is to say, what are the web page addresses for the various registries where this info is stated as required/enforced/recommended?

4) Most importantly, since the term """"required"""" calls for a resource by which adherence to this """"requirement"""" can be enforced, could you also please provide  the resources through which interested puppy buyers can confirm testing results for the individual dogs (or their parentage) they are interested in purchasing.  Whether claimed as required or not by whichever registries or breeders, these claims have no value (other than through """"blind trust"""") to potential puppy buyers unless they have an opportunity to verify the results themselves through independent means.

In other words, if a reader wants to research the hip """"grades"""" of the parents of a puppy they are considering buying (not generic group testing results) would you please indicate where that information can be found for each of the registries (NSBR, ISSR, TSSR)?  
 
Example: 

NSBR - Hip registration is primarily through OFA. To view OFA's hip information on NSBR dogs, please view website address www.xxxxxx.org""""
      AND
ISSR -  Hip registration is through OFA and Penn-Hip. To view OFA's hip information on ISSR dogs, please view website address www.xxxxxx.org. To view Penn-Hip's hip information on ISSR dogs, please view website address www.zzzzz.org  """"
      AND
TSSR - Hip registration is conducted through XXXX, however individual results are provided to prospective and current puppy owners by submitting a Request for Health Results Form, available at www.TSSR.com/Request for Health info.
 
4)If verification of these requirements for the registries is not published nor can be obtained in writing, would you also please indicate this policy.

If you can only provide resource information for a registry you are affiliated with, I would then ask that other discussion participants (i.e. registry members or non-affiliated breeders) provide this information and their policies in answer to my requests above.

Thank you very kindly. M.Dùfy

But please note: be bold in updating pages does not mean that you should make deletions to long articles on complex, controversial subjects with long histories, such as Israeli-Palestinian conflict or Abortion. In many such cases, the text as you find it has come into being after long and arduous negotiations between Wikipedians of diverse backgrounds and points of view. An incautious edit to such an article can be akin to stirring up a hornet's nest, and other users who are involved in the page may react angrily.

If you encounter an article on a controversial subject that you would like to edit, first read the comments on the talk page and view the Page history to get a sense of how the article came into being and what its current status is.

If you are an experienced wiki-ist, you will probably have a good sense what will be accepted edits, and which edits should be discussed first.

If you are new to wikipedia, or unsure how others will view your proposals, and you want to change or delete anything substantial in the text, you should either:

   1. If the material in question is a sentence or so in length, copy it to the Talk page and list your objections there.
   2. If the material is longer than a sentence, list your objections on the Talk page but leave the main article as it is.

Then, wait a bit for responses. If no one objects, proceed. But always move large deletions to Talk and list your objections to the text so that other people will understand your changes and will be able to follow the history of the page.

Also, show respect for consensus. Avoid making major changes to an article if a vote (or poll) is currently in progress about whether those changes should be made, especially if there is no clear consensus shown by the vote.

 Genres 

 I can see this is becoming an issue on a number of other pages.  It's not enough simply to have a source when adding genres to an infobox:
 The """"genre"""" field should be limited to genres that describe the album (or group, or whatever) in general, and not every genre that has been incorprated into it.  Imagine what the Beatles' infobox would look like otherwise.
 The sources you are citing are not necessarily supporting the genres you're adding: for instance, Earles says: """"Side B is ... proto-Sabbath sludge metal or proto-noise rock, depending on how you wish to retroactively consider this stuff against the underground rock history that came before and has transpired since ... etc etc doom metal scene etc etc power- and thrash-metal movements ..."""" ... it takes quite an imagination to read that and conclude that My War is a """"sludge metal album"""".
 """"Genre"""" is the kind of thing Wikipedians often come close to slitting each others' jugulars over (see WP:GENREWARRIOR).  If you want to stay on good terms with your fellow editors, you'd best discuss changes to the """"genre"""" field on the talk page.

 Retired numbers - Peyton Manning removal 

A user, who I've engaged in conversation on their talk page, removed Peyton Manning from the """"Retired numbers"""" section of the article, on the grounds that it's """"assumed"""" though not """"official.""""  My reasoning as posted on said talk page, was that Jim Irsay, the CEO of the Colts, stated pretty firmly that no player will ever wear the number 18 again (http://www.thephinsider.com/2012/3/7/2853459/peyton-manning-press-conference-transcript-2012-free-agency-nfl).

 """"GREEK CAPITAL LETTER YOT"""" in Unicode 6.0.0

First off, thanks a million for doing the merge – been out all day, couldn't do it myself despite my intentions.
Yup, I saw you were working on t'article so I decided not to stick my bloody nose into it. While you'are at it, be careful w/ word order here: """"A small statue of the Virgin and child is seen behind the main figures, positioned in a choir screen, between two lit candles"""". If you put the bold text at the end, it may be confusing 'cause it could be interpreted as if the main figures were the ones in the choir screen, which obvs is not the case. Plus, it isn't quite clear what is between the lit candles (the choir or the statue) and, IMHO, """"positioned"""" makes the prose a trifle verbose and could be left out – sorry if I'm being a pain in the arse. Just don't wanna change it myself without telling you first. Vile and vicious as I might seem, I'm all for dialogue and collaborative work.
You delectable silly sausage! Why would I get miffed* at a stoopid e/c? That was the Clash of the Titans, that was. *I'm fuming, eejit (nah, joking).

Speedy deletion of Nvidia 9800 GX2
 A tag has been placed on Nvidia 9800 GX2 requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G12 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be a blatant copyright infringement. For legal reasons, we cannot accept copyrighted text or images borrowed from other web sites or printed material, and as a consequence, your addition will most likely be deleted. You may use external websites as a source of information, but not as a source of sentences. This part is crucial: say it in your own words.

If the external website belongs to you, and you want to allow Wikipedia to use the text — which means allowing other people to modify it — then you must include on the external site the statement """"I, (name), am the author of this article, (article name), and I release its content under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.2 and later."""" You might want to look at Wikipedia's policies and guidelines for more details, or ask a question here. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Libertatia>  """"It strikes me that the an-cap vision being presented here makes the freedom of the market primary, and the freedom of individuals secondary.""""

No, you have it backwards.  Freedom of individuals is the primary; freedom of the market is simply the application of freedom of individuals with respect to production and trade.

Libertatia>  """"Anarchism has never been whatever remains in the absence of the state""""

Right. Anarchism is the philosophy with the goal absense of State.  Of course, anarchists can have other values, too.  E.g. We have various additional values which we want in addition to no  state.  But statelessness  is the primary and defining value of anarchism.

Libertatia>  """"No capitalist I know of espouses capitalism on a moral basis ...""""

??? Rand, Rothbard, Hoppe, hell, just about every anarcho-capitalist I know bases it on the NAP (non-aggression principle) except Friedman and Narveson.

Libertatia>  """"... on the basis it """"knows"""" what is best for everyone.""""

Right. We generally abhor utilitarianism, but of course that is not the only moral basis. We tend to prefer Natural Law rather than utilitarian moral justifications.

Libertatia> """"Capitalism, like evolution, is nothing more than a blind algorithmic process, which tends to have a certain effect in terms of efficient allocation of resources. It is entirely agnostic, of itself, to """"what's best for the society"""", or even whether there is a society...""""

Right on. We see society more as an ecosystem with emergent order, as opposed to the statist view of society as a machine to be fixed by some imposed planned order.

My current project on Wikipedia is increasing the quality and quantity of copyediting. We have people who are good with AP Stylebook and Websters, but we have very few people participating in article reviews who have many years of professional copyediting experience, and I'm wondering ... why?  Some copyeditors have switched jobs, or are retired, or aren't sufficiently challenged, and wouldn't mind doing a little volunteer copyediting, and it would be nice to have more professionals in the mix.  If you're interested in doing more, great; if not, this is just an informal survey, and I'd appreciate your ideas on what would attract more professional copyeditors.

27f50b9e0877a5c1,"A personal Account of Cyclothymia 

Dear Friends, 

I'm still very unhappy about this Wikipedia page on Cyclothymia and I see that it has got even worse recently due to these copy-right problems. People will naturally be turning to Wikipedia as a first step to find out something about Cyclothymic Personality Disorder and they will be unaware of the controversies surrounding it e.g. that it is even disputed to be a personality disorder. http://s13.zetaboards.com/TheCollective/index/ and http://www.chatarea.com/TheCyclothymiaCollective appeared to have died since I last visited them so active discussion with other people who have been diagnosed or hope to be diagnosed is not presently possible, so let me offer this letter for the casual enquirer to read about the actual symptoms of somebody who has been diagnosed as Cyclothymic. The reader will note from the complaint above that I am unhappy that the main article does not contain any warning about such 'mixed state' Cyclothymia which frequently causes misdiagnosis as depression resulting in medication with anti-depressants which makes the condition worse. My attempt to rectify that state of affairs resulted in my contribution being removed, so I will not waste any time on making a new ammendment. Please be kind enough to leave this in the discussion though. The following is not for diagnostic purposes but solely to provide the enquirer with a taste of the sorts of symptoms that can be diagnosed as Cyclothymia. I was diagnosed 16 years after the onset of these symptoms, and this is a letter applying to volunteer to be the subject of some research conducted by my local university.

Dear Dr X,
 
I recently participated in the Beating Bipolar research, I was in the control group. I was handed a letter inviting me to participate in your research involving an MRI scan which intrigues me. I was intending to write this email several weeks ago but I put it off because I wanted to write you an account of what happens to me in my disorder that has been diagnosed as Cyclothymia. Since I am not getting around to writing you a longer account let me write you a short account, because I would very much like to be put in that MRI scan twice. Once I know that I am becoming hyperthymic ( hypomanic ) I can roughly predict when I am going to be hypothymic ( depressed ). This is because my cycles are extremely regular - given a distinct stress such as losing a job or starting a relationship I can mark out in advance on a calender when I will be high ( at end of the fifth week following ) and when I will be low ( at the end of the seventh week following ) and when I will come out on a level again ( at the end of the twelth week following ). I've always felt that the mechanical predictability of this should intrigue researchers, and I believe that what has happened to me is that the stress response mechanism has had its period reset. This first happened when I was 19 circa September 1981 and has continued ever since, but it took me until I was 25 to clearly identify that it was a cycle because it had disrupted my life so much. Originally I believed that I was dealing with the sort of kaleidoscope of problems that perhaps are typical of young people but having dealt with those problems with various counselling psychologies I was left facing a problem that could not be taken away. By the age of 35 I was chronically depressed because of the host of problems that came in its wake - unemployment, poverty, social isolation and depression - and my doctor at the time wrote me off onto Sick Benefit. This resulted in an interview with the Department of Social Security doctor who not only recognised that I was being discriminated against in employment but diagnosed me as having cyclothymia of a mixed state variety and recognised that doctors had kept interpretting my presenting symptoms as acute depression. I have since been moved onto Incapacity Benefit and have been monitored by a psychiatrist ever since, presently Dr X of the Community Mental Health Team in the X clinic.
 
I'd prefer to present this with diagrams, but it's not possible in an email - please feel free to draw your own !
 
The Basic Cycle
 
There is a stress event - a good example is a car crash that I was in with my partner at the time in which the car somersaulted down the ditch and yet we got out of it only bruised. She was shaking and very excitably upset at the time, couldn't sleep that night and the following day was tearful but then slept properly and was fairly normal the following day but wouldn't drive. She was bemused that I was so calm, arranged for help, drew a measured sketch map, slept well except for the bruises and drove us the 200 miles home. My own response to this stressful event was similar to hers only my excitable state came five weeks later and my depressed state seven weeks after the event. I was on a",0,0,0,0,0,0

I highly doubt that the US gov't is or was responsible for defining the capacity of a barrel of crude oil used for commerce (or that it is a world-wide legal requirement to use a US-gov't definition) but if there is any such legal requirement then again a reference should be stated in the main article.

Hello, Director.sara, and welcome to Wikipedia! Thank you for your contributions.

I notice that one of the first articles you edited  appears to be dealing with a topic with which you may have a conflict of interest. In other words, you may find it difficult to write about that topic in a neutral and objective way, because you are, work for, or represent, the subject of that article. Your recent contributions may have already been undone for this very reason. 

To reduce the chances of your contributions being undone, you might like to draft your revised article before submission, and then ask me or any other editor to proofread it. See our help page on userspace drafts for more details. If the page you created has already been deleted from Wikipedia, but you want to save the content from it to use for that draft, don't hesitate to ask anyone from this list and they will copy it to your user page.

The one firm rule we do have in connection with conflicts of interest is that accounts used by more than one person will unfortunately be blocked from editing. It is also worth noting that Wikipedia generally does not allow editors to have usernames which specifically link them to one company or corporation. If your username does have such a name, it would be advisable for you to request a change of username.

If you are stuck, and looking for help, please come to the New contributors' help page, where experienced Wikipedians can answer any queries you have! You can also just type  on your user page, and someone will show up shortly to answer your questions. Here are a few other good links for newcomers:

As I explained in an edit summary this sentence attempts to summarise the information in mephedrone#UK. 'People have died after taking mephedrone' is intended to summarise """"mephedrone had been alleged to be involved in 52 fatalities in the UK, but detected in only 38 of these cases"""". Likewise 'some deaths the media attributed to the drug were later determined to have been caused by other factors' is summarising """"The death of a teenager in the UK in November 2009 was widely reported as being caused by mephedrone, but a report by the coroner concluded she had died from natural causes. In March 2010, the deaths of two teenagers in Scunthorpe were widely reported by the media to be caused by mephedrone. Toxicology reports showed the teenagers had not taken any mephedrone and had died as a result of consuming alcohol and the heroin substitute methadone"""". Both parts are important and should be mentioned in the lead and if you read the references you should realise that this is exceptional to mephedrone as deaths were over-reported and mis-reported by the media - comparisons with other topics are irrelevant. I agree that it is a bit weasely, but how else to you suggest that that section is summarised? WP:LEADCITE is very vague about whether citations are required and when I wrote the lead I erred on making it easier to read rather than ensuring that every fact was supported by a citation there (Wikipedia:Citation_overkill). I could easily copy the references from the main article to the lead for this sentence, but then someone will likely come along and complain that other sentences don't have citations...

 Editing own comments 

In the context of misrepresentation, may I draw your attention to WP:Talk:

'Altering a comment after it has been replied to robs the reply of its original context. It can also be confusing. Before you change, consider taking one of the following steps:
 Contact the person(s) who replied (through their talk page) and ask if it is okay to delete or change your text.
 use strike-through or a place-holder to show the comment has been altered.
 Strike-through is typed like this and ends up like this.
 A placeholder is a phrase such as """"[Thoughtless and stupid comment removed by the author.]"""". This will ensure that your fellow editors' irritated responses still make sense. In turn, they may then wish to replace their reply with something like, """"[Irritated response to deleted comment removed. Apology accepted.]""""

a5bc079c9a976857,"It's clear that TheOldJacobite is doing nothing more than what he accuses others of... E.g. Not adhering to Wiki policy, constantly breaching anti-reversion rules and generally trolling to try and start editing wars with new editors. His latest revert - after admin decision - is clearly spiteful vandalism.
1) he left the article in an unreferenced state for months, and made no attempt to clear them up or remove them.
2) he took exception to an entry that was referenced properly, including a reference to the BBC - the BBC being a reference source for other items on this page, yet hypocrisy reared its head and TheOldJacobite failed to acknowledge, only finally accepting when having the nonsense of his illogical inconsistent application of policy pointed out.
2a) he also claimed that the newspaper source included wants notable enough despite having a readership level that warranted its own actual entry in Wikipedia - a newspaper that has been published for over 100 years.
3) he continually reverts the repair of the included entry, which meets ALL Wiki policies. These are reverted accordingly by me as they breach no rules but simply have some personal issue with TheOldJacobite. Maybe TheOldJacobite thinks he owns the page. Who knows what motive lies behind the behaviour?
4) He then summons up 'help' from a sock-buddy who also removes it and then threatens me with blocking because he can't gets his own way. That editor has no and rights so simply reverts to threats and bravado against a new user. it should be noted that Sjo has been previously warned on his page about treating new editors with contempt and warning him to stop simply removing new edits, so a behaviour pattern that is common to both of them.
5) TheOldJacobite then has me referred to admin for alleged vandalism - no action is taken. TheOldJacobite also tries to make me out as some sort of vandal purely because I have an IP rather than a full username...this is just childish diversion tactics,
6) TheOldJacobite requests the page is locked - no action is taken as admins clearly don't agree. If anything it should be locked against him reverting a totally acceptable entry.
7) Electric Wombat (admin) reviews the entry and determines it's good for inclusion and asks all to stop the edit war. I agree but would like to see an equal admonishment made to TheOldJacobite and Sjo for their arbitrary editing, non equitable application of policy and the gang-up bullying mentality against a new user. But, I won't hold my breath as I've seen all of TheOldJacobite's and Sjo's disciplinary record and it's clear that nothing really gets done about trolls like these so-called [editors] who simply delight on playing judge and jury and clearly think they own Wikipedia.
8) Despite Electric Wombat's decision of inclusion, TheOldJacobite again reverts the entry.  this is clearly against strict Wiki rules about reverting after an admin decision has been made. I wonder if ThOldJacobite will be blocked temporarily for sticking two fingers up at the admin team?
9) I have now applied the admin decision and reverted it back to what it was before TheOldJacobite vandalised it yet again.
10) I am wondering if Wikipedia is broken beyond repair when it allows personal and prejudicial views of editors like TheOldJacobite and Sjo to interfere with the mission statement of Wikipedia to create a globally-contributed knowledge base.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I would disagree with whole """"how it is seen by the world"""" statement.  First of all, it will be seen by the world as it presents itself.  I really doubt after they stop using SUNY at Stony Brook, which they just have, that this name will last in anyones memory for long.  I would also point you to some less political references than those you put up, such as the wikipedia article for University at Buffalo, State University of New York.  They did the same thing a while back, and their website uses that designation.  Berkely is the same way.  It is technically UC Berkeley, but that isn't what you see on their website.

It would not be surprising that anything from SUNY head office or whatever it is would continue to use the old designation, but that is politics, and is hardly an area we need to play to here.  If they could stop Stony Brook from changing their name, they would.  No bureaucrat gives up power if they can prevent it.  It is a fait accompli.

Hi.

The Springboard source is not a blog; it is a column by Windows IT Pro, and it is written by Paul Thurrott. It has all three elements of a reliable source: Credible author, credible publisher and contents itself. 

Unlike what you think, it was not a set of """"abstract techniques""""; it was tangible changes visible to laymen end-user ([[a new version of Windows Firewall, a new version of Internet Explorer 6 and the famous Windows Security Center.) Windows XP Service Pack 2 was in important milestone because at the time Microsoft was under full-scale global scrutiny about the state of security in its products. Windows XP Service Pack 2 was a security facelift in Windows XP, so there is little surprise its security portion has its own codename.

So we're back at the point we were before - is there something special about the relationship between Hagos and Biasutti that allows this transfer of expertise just by citation? My point is that it takes years of training, experience and recognition by others in the field to be considered an expert in that field. You seem to be saying Hagos got it just by citing Biasutti. If David Attenborough cited Niels Bohr would he become an expert in Physics? No he wouldn't, he'd just be an expert in biology who happened to cite an expert in physics once - we wouldn't be able to accept anything he said about quantum mechanics or block holes as fact until we checked it with a genuine expert in the field. So what makes you think Hagos has become an expert in human skin colour just by citing Biasutti? And remember that the policy doesn't just state """"expert"""",  it states """"established expert in the topic whose previous work in the field has been published by reliable third-party publications"""" - unless you are you going to argue that Hagos got Biasutti's reputation and previous publications as well I think this is a dead end argument. You should accept that Hagos doesn't meet the criteria laid down by the WP policy for the creators of self-published sources.
If you don't think that Hagos chose the colours for each country then who do you think did it? They didn't just magically change due to """"migration trends"""" - somebody made a decision that colour X goes in country Y. From the evidence we have it would appear that Hagos was the one who made that decision - it certainly wasn't made by Biasutti or the writers of the national census data that he cites as his sources.
It makes no difference to the situation so I won't argue it, but for the record I don't accept that Hagos is a recognised expert on migration.

 Olympic 

Formation and early years
The name was chosen by James Edmondson, the club's first treasurer, and is believed to have been inspired by the recent excavation of Olympia, site of the ancient Olympic Games. It's referenced by Phythian, p. 7?
Yes, that's right    
Decline and colapse
In 1886 the club's committee was forced to reduce the players' wages to a quarter of what was being offered by Preston North End. Why it is comparing with the PNE? It's because some players went to play there?
Simply because PNE were the top club in the area.  It shows how much worse Olympic's wages were compared to the top club in the area.  Hope that makes sense    
Rivalries
The rivalry became especially fierce in September 1884, when, amid accusations that the clubs were using underhand tactics in attempts to """"poach"""" each others' star players, the Rovers' secretary sent a telegram to his opposite number stating that his club would play no matches against Olympic in the 1884–85 season.

 Interesting article from Will Collier on DeepDiscount, eBay and early shippin' books. 

This article was brought to my attention this morning.  Not sure how/if it needs to be incorperated into the article, but it is an interesting read.

http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=OTYxYmE5Y2UzNDMyNWQ2YzFmYTk3NzY1MTkxZGFhNzI=

 
Thanks, I added the info.  

 Traces to the person who leaked the photos of Deathly Hallows 

It seems, that the pictures leaked on the internet help the investigators, because metadata saved in the pictures reveal more information. Also other aspects can help to identify the person.
See this article: http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/books/article2104250.ece ( )
This could be getting to the point where there should be a separate article entirely that traces the story of this particular Harry Potter leak, considering it has led to sustained press coverage and lawsuits.  As this seems to be the only full leak of the entire book, negating the need for disambig, perhaps it should simply be entitled Leak of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.  
Try not to get ensnared in recentism. While there is still a ton of documentation, there isn't an enormous amount of unique information. We should wait a bit, see if it can't be condensed, and then consider a split.- 
Yeah, I agree with that.  Only if it gets to the point where further legal action is taken or if this person's identity is discovered.  

If there is enough information, this would be an interesting article, but it should report the story of the leak from the beginning to the ending - if there will be one ;) - and background information. It would also shorten the hole article Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows there should be a section where a few sentences describe what happened and then above """"Main Article: Leak of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"""". But I agree with Wafulz, that we should wait.  

 Dealing with inevitable spoilers 

We need a hideable section template.  That way people can post the plot details, but have them hidden by default so people don't have to read them if they don't want to.  (Talk  Contrib) 

Trust me, you don't want to get involved in this type of spoiler discussion. It has resulted in months of arguments on Wikipedia:Spoiler, several Requests for comment, and a requested arbitration case.- 

I think, plot details shouldn't be revealed before the book is officialy released. Wikipedia shouldn't spread illegaly gotten information.  

Considering that some people have quite legally obtained the book before its """"official"""" release, not all the """"spoilers"""" are """"illegally gotten infomation"""".  Perhaps you should put a bit more thought into your comments before you make a blanket statment implying that a large amount of your fellow Wiki editors are criminals.

fec6961acc20d82e,"I have just followed from your edit exchange on the article Blu-Ray Disc to find the exchange above.  Sadly, you appear to know little about the subject, and to be fair, it has become confusing because much of the terminology has become abused.

First, European Blu-Ray discs are not produced in 24p format.   That is almost exclusively the preserve of the American regions.  Secondly, the Blu-Ray format does not support the proper 1080 progressive high definition formats (1080/50p and 1080/60p (and I include the 59.95p in that).  This is because the data rate is not fast enough for these formats.  The European sourced discs that state 1080p on the packaging are discs produced from film originated material and is one of the abuses of the term progressive.  The term progressive strictly defines a video format where the lines of video information are recorded in strict numerical order, 

1 - 2 - 3 - 4 - 5 ... 1078 - 1079 -1080.  

Alternatively, there is the interlaced format which displays the odd lines ony first (odd field) and then follows them by the even lines (even field). (You probably know this already).

1 - 3 - 5 - 7 ... 1077 - 1079 - 2 - 4 - 6 ... 1078 - 1080

They are actually stored in the digital video frame the other way around due to the digital video format's origins in the NTSC world.  In true video source material, the even field displays a time slice that is 20 milliseconds later than the odd field and the two together give a comlete video frame.  This is also largely true in the Americas, except the even field precedes the odd field by ~16.6 miliiseconds.

There is a largish group of enthusiasts (if that's the right word) who have become somewhat anally retentive over the progressive video formats and who have convinced themselves that progressive is the only way to go.  The reality is that any improvement in the visual perception of the video is marginal at best and certainly not worth the doubling of the required digital data to support it.  But for them, everything has to be progressive.  I shall coin the word 'progressivists' for this discussion.

When film originated material is transferred to video in Europe, the film is run slightly fast by 4% which allows one film frame to occupy both the the odd and even fields of the video frame (known as 2:2 pulldown).  Thus the even field displays a time slice that is 0 milliseconds later than the odd field.  In order to satisfy the progressivists, the Blu-Ray producers state that such material is in 1080p format, but using something called a 'Progressive Segmented Frame' technique (though they don't mention that last bit on the box).  That is: that it is progressive video, but the odd lines have been recorded together and then they are followed by the even lines.  It is really interlaced video, but by the time the display device or the Blu-ray player has de-interlaced the video (it doesn't matter one jot where it actually happens), the result is perceptually indistinguishable from true 1080/25p video (assuming the deinterlacing algorithm works properly).  If watched on a CRT display then, of course, the video will be interlaced as there is no deinterlacing prior to display, but with that number of lines, no one is likely to notice (unless they sit inches away from the screen).  The description 1080p on the box is, technically at least, wrong but percetually the same as 1080/25p video.  The 4% speed up goes completely un-noticed especially these days when the sound is adjusted back to the original pitch - and obviously you hadn't noticed it yourself if you had convinced yourself that you were watching films at the original speed.

Once we cross to the Americas, different problems occur.  Obviously, running the film at 30 frames per second is not an option, so instead, film is converted to video by storing the same film frame on 3 half video frames, followed by storing the next frame on 2 half video frames and then repeating 3 - 2 - 3 - 2.  Thus 4 film frames occupy 5 video frames (the technique is 3:2 pulldown - often wrongly called 2:3 pulldown).  Properly deinterlaced, such material is perfectly watchable and the viewer unlikely to feel anything is wrong.  But the progressivists have decided that it is not the way to watch film material and have even invented faults to justify a move to a progressive format.  I have even seen claims (obviously failing to understand the technique) that movement in the resultant video is uneven in that it jumps 50% further every other jump due to the 3 half fields.  

The result was the 24p format.  The only problem with the 24p format is that if you try to watch it on a CRT display (and A CRT is still unbeatable for contrast and colour reproduction), the result will be unviewable to bad flicker - something that was known as long ag",0,0,0,0,0,0

Dear Ryan,

In reply to your question concerning somebody's claim on my wiki page that
I was fired by Jared Israel from Emperor's Clothes, this is false. I was
never fired by Jared Israel because I was nevery in his employ. There was
never a contract that made Jared Israel my employer. My work for Emperor's
Clothes was volunteer work. Jared Israel and I had some differences and I
quit. Moreover, since I was supporting Jared Israel and Emperor's Clothes
financially, at the time, if anything it was I who employed Jared Israel. I
have the email that I sent him, in which I quit, if Wikipedia needs to see
it. But the whole thing seems rather irrelevant to me, and I doubt that
every personal dispute a person has with another person needs to be on
Wikipedia.

Best,

Francisco Gil-White

I have therefore removed all mention of such a firing, and I think it is best if the particular claims about Steven wise and the shoah, etc. be kept on the blog discussion pages they are on, as they don't seem too relevant to this biographical page.

Second, we should keep the design language separate from what is produced with the design language (the UI). IMO """"Metro design language"""" is fine as the article title. It's the historical name that everyone knew. If anything,  """"Microsoft design language"""" would seem to be the strongest candidate to replace it. But this is different from all of the different official and unofficial names for the UI that users see, which tend to be tied to the products  Zune UI, Windows Store apps, etc. –   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 OSE 

 Regarding this edit/revert, don't you think that's the whole point of the  link, so that we don't have four paragraphs of repeated material? I think it's important, absolutely, but this page is already long and encompassing, I would think it would make sense to slim down a little where we can, and the OSE concept does have its own page that not only begins with that text verbatim, but goes into it much deeper.
 I'm not going to get into a revert war over it; that'd be silly, and I don't even want to think about 1RR or 2RR. I'd rather get your perspective and rationale surrounding it and perhaps (probably) we can see the other's impetus and figure out the best, most logical, and most effective final solution. Moving it wholesale probably isn't it, but having a full screen-page of duplicate info isn't either, I don't (right now) think. I'd like to hear your insights on the matter.

""""NDP-affiliated""""
I added a fact tag to the four-times-reinserted modifier """"NDP-affiliated"""" to the mention of Bill Tieleman; other journalists are not generally singled out by party affiliation/loyalty, nor are publishers such as CanWest (which is widely seen as a propaganda arm of the BC Liberal Party, also one of the party's major financial contributors).  It's not that Tieleman isn't an NDPer, but his credentials go beyond his NDP politicking and he is increasingly a critic of that party, also.  I'm responding partly, also to [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Christy_Clark&action;=historysubmit&diff;=401129881&oldid;=401095803 this edit by ).  I've puzzled long and hard over my own real-world COI on BC political articles, but I see no reason to recuse myself from participation in BC political arti9cles, though generally I give them as wide a berth as possible; but when I recognize POV political activity/wording, as a responsible Wikipedian I can't not say something about it, or challenge the POVism - and COI/spin edits - when I see them.  My interest here is to prevent Wikipedia from being used as part of any campaign p.r. machine (of any party), and to make sure Wikipedia principles are observed - particularly by party operatives who have no reason to respect Wikipedia guidelines or concepts like WP:NPOV.  In the case of this item about BC Rail, there's lots missing, including the search of the Clark-Marrissen home during the opening of the investigation (and that curious telephone call thelling them the police were coming, and why no warrant was needed....vs. all the other highly suspect/irregular warrants to do with that case).  But there's also lots of other commentators, particularly from smalltown papers or independently syndicated, but also notable bloggers/indepednent reserachers like Sean Holman, Laila Yuile and BC Mary who have similarly spoken out about Clark's involvement in the BC Rail matter and how it weights against her in the eyes of the public, and of the """"informed media"""".  She may have been out of teh way for the HST fracas, and the Big Media have pronounced her """"clean"""" of that - but he Big Media also have maintained a veil of silence over BC Rail.  The current text says that she resigned for family reasons; but it's well-citable  that the timing of her resignation was seen to have to do with the BC Rail affair.  And about the Tieleman thing, unless every time Conservative-affiliated columnists or BC Liberal-affiliated columnists and media outlets are similarly tagged in articles mentioning their opninions and claims (often false), it's not fair to single out Tieleman for this; that's the reason for the cite tag; Tieleman's own byline says only """"Bill Tieleman is one of BC's best known communicators, political commentators and strategists. Bill writes a politics column Tuesdays in 24 Hours newspaper and The Tyee online magazine. Bill has been Communications Director in the B.C. Premier's Office and at the BC Federation of Labour. Bill owns West Star Communications, a consulting firm providing strategy and communication services for labour, business, non-profits and government.""""

I think that it deserves its own page - even though politically it is Lysa. I rode my bike there from Kareny and it was surrounded by countryside, not obviously part of Lysa, but a seperate settlement. There should be a link on the Lysa page to Byšičky, though.

 Failed Edits Problem 

I was browsing a forum in which a number of Wikipedians were discussing the failed edit problem. And I think that I have the solution.

From what I understand, the problem could result from human error. Many people, when editing, have a number of windows open on an article. They enter an edit to one window, and then, without refreshing their browser, edit that same page again, negating the original edit with their save....

 PLate OPtimizer 

In response to your request of 21 June 2009 about the notability of an article on the """"PLate OPtimizer"""" program:  Cells for holding mirrors in telescopes is already a fairly obscure topic.  A program to design such cells is even more obscure.  And an article devoted to only one such program is very obscure.  The article doesn't make clear how widely this program is used; indeed, the article mentions a number of the program's shortcomings, which must limit its value.

Wikipedia: Plagiarism states that

""""Plagiarism is the incorporation of someone else's work without providing adequate credit. While the terms are often confused, plagiarism and copyright infringement are not the same thing. Copyright infringement occurs when copyrighted content is used without permission in a way that violates the copyright holder's exclusive right; adequate credit does not efface infringement. Similarly, public domain content is plagiarized if used without acknowledging the source, even though there is no copyright issue. This guideline addresses when copying and close paraphrasing may not be a problem, how to avoid plagiarism when there is a risk, and how to address it when it is encountered."""" (citation)

Wikipedia copyright issues stats that

""""However, material copied from sources that are not public domain or compatibly licensed without the permission of the copyright holder (unless brief quotation used in accordance with non-free content policy and guideline) is likely to be a copyright violation. Even inserting text copied with some changes can be a copyright violation if there's substantial linguistic similarity in creative language or structure(this can also raise problems of plagiarism). Such a situation should be treated seriously, as copyright violations not only harm Wikipedia's redistributability, but also create legal issues."""" (citation)

Both is not given. Just because there are concerning article passage doens't mean that they fall under such a categorie.

Notability of Aislin Band
A tag has been placed on Aislin Band requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable.

I don't know about you personally, Ironholds, but a different conclusion was reachable.  This was a case of """"keep listing until it gets restored"""", and—as was statistically certain given enough relistings—eventually the """"restore"""" votes showed up in sufficient numbers to carry the day, provided you isolate DRV#11 from the previous ten DRVs and 19 AFDs.

Dear Lex, Thanks for your clarification of Judge Learned Hand. I guess I should not trust my memory.

The only times I remember citing blogs were the WSJwhen I cited the article, not the commentary, which was an interview. That was deleted.and when I used them as evidence of pro se dissatisfaction.  I see that you also deleted a quote of a court case that was in a blog.  I am positive that that was an accurate quote of a transcript with a statement by a federal judge.  I will have to go read up on Wikipedia sources again.

Also I am positive that the quote about the federal district court discouraging pro ses from using their mediation is correct, but I will have to check on the link.  Why didn't you just flag the source instead of deleting it?

Please don't insult me.  I am not trying to insult you.

Other than my complaints of censorship, please provide three examples of what you claim was my """"disruptive"""" editing.  Or do you just want to go on with the article from where we are?

This is an example of an unsupported statement in the article that I don't believe is true: """"The California rules express a preference for resolution of every case on the merits, even if resolution requires excusing inadvertance by a pro se litigant that would otherwise result in a dismissal. While this rule creates a double standard"""".  I think this means """"pro se litigants get an unfair advantage"""". Wasn't it you that wrote that?
FYI, I was put in jail  for over 4 months solely for engaging in pro se litigation.  The only way I could get out was to agree to withdraw all pro se litigation. My husband was threatened w jail for paying for me to file a complaint while I was in jail and paying for a typist.  And no, I don't believe there is a a history of """"putting people in jail who think the rules don't apply to them and who can't conform themselves to them.""""  To the best of my knowledge, in civilized countries people are only put in jail for committing crimes and as far as summary contempt use of jail is very limited.  I saw an article, for instance, about a judge who put a whole courtroom in jail for 2 hours because of an objectionable ringing  cell phone.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Actually, it is unquestionagbly mocking when someone comments about your being blocked, knowing that you cannot respond to them. Especially from an administrator. Why was ANY comment even necessary once I was already blocked, especially from the involved editor/admin who asked you to do it? I never said or even implied that everyone else was at fault; I apologized multiple times for sounding too harsh with the editor who's been adding the questionable content. Beyond that, my primary goal was to get this massive problem solved; massive because of how many articles are involved. I am in no way alone in my feelings on this issue.

Dear , with all the good will I have for your inquiry for recommendations among Adam Thorpe's ouevre, I'm afraid I must disappoint you as I have virtually nothing to offer. The loss is mine as well: a trudge to the local library revealed its collection to hold precisely zero titles of his. I've only recently discovered this author; the one volume of his I read, Shifts, was brought home from (and subsequently returned to) what we call the """"pass-around"""" box outside the library door, filled with individuals' discards that don't pass the librarians' muster for inclusion on the limited-space English-language shelves. (Resource restrictions prevent me from acquiring books by choice; happily, I'm largely content to make do with what comes my way.) I was impressed with this collection of short stories, a favorite genre of mine, and likewise noted the author's recognition as a poet and dramatist. Imagine my indignation, then, to discover he had no page in the English-language Wikipedia! As with other authors I consider worthy of promotion, I took the time and made the effort to create a page with what I could find on the Web, and was gratified to subsequently it expanded by fellow editors.

Strong oppose .  The Serer Niominka are part of the Serer ethnic group.  Failure to recognise that would be a failure to recognise the diversity of the Serer group.  Even Becker commented on this diversity (See: Charles Becker. """"Vestiges historiques, trémoins matériels du passé clans les pays sereer"""". Dakar. 1993).  Not only are they group together with the Serers because they speak Serer, but they also have Serer culture etc. Every one even in the Senegambia refer to them as Serers and they see themselves as Serers.  Is just like saying the Ndut and Safi etc who speak Cangin languages are not Serers ethnically.  Sometimes people use Niominka as a shorthand, but I don't think we should deny people their Serer heritage.  Indeed, by referring to them as Serer-Niominkaa, we recognise both their Serer heritage and Niominka.  To call them just Niominka would be denying them their Serer heritage.  Many scholar refer to them as Serer-Niominka just as Serer-Njegeme, Serer-Siin, etc.  (See:   Dennis Charles Galvan. The state must be our master of fire, p38. Also: Leonardo Alfonso Villalón. Islamic society and state power in Senegal, p51; African economic history, volume 25, University of WisconsinMadison. African Studies Program, p32).  Most of the confusion regarding who should be called Serer is to do with the various cangin languages and Serer Sine.  The Serer people however are not confused and they see themselves as Serer ethnically even if they speak a different dialect or language to other Serers.  It is normally outsiders who tend to divide the Serer into compartments rather than just letting them be.  The Serer Associations of Dakar as well as the Serer community have been trying for years to fight this division of the Serer group by outsiders.  No one is subsuming anyone.  Serer-Niominka culture is recognised and celebrated within the Serer group just like Serer-Sine, Serer-Njegheme etc.  The reason for this is, because it is Serer culture period.

0fed60b513d1dd8f,"""=== Page is in rough shape ===
With the recent purge of content, the page is not as informative as it once was.  The biggest problem is the first section which had the  """"proposed benefits of basic income"""" topic removed.  One editor may appear to hate naturalfinance.net, since the reason for removal was declaring that site to be a blog.  Also removed were affordability calculations that were researched and verified with working links, but also published on a platform that can be declared to be a blog.  Meanwhile the content left in the top section has poor references that do not appear to match the content.  For instance there is no reference for any conclusive argument or data that basic income creates a disincentive to work, and the link to reciprocity is not online, and the topic not a major issue.  Both of those topics have good quality """"blog classifiable"""" sources available.

In order to Be Bold, I would recommend that eligible source material be broadened to include any quality content, including from sources that are not government funded.  Basic income is after all not within any traditional government agenda, and so limiting information to sources funded by interests against basic income harms the quality of the article, and prejudices/suppresses the article from being informative and enlightening.  Barring this broadened content eligibility, we all need guidance for what is eligible content, and perhaps what makes naturalfinance.net ineligible.  (The content there was written in 2011, and has been adopted, whether independently or without attribution, by other authors)

Here is the major recent deletion https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basic_income&diff;=595677190&oldid;=595667344 .  Specifically the proposed benefits section should be reproduced.  Some of these can be sourced elsewhere, but we need a clear understanding of why it was originally deleted:   

Proposed Benefits

naturalfinance.net describes several purported benefits of social dividends and basic income:
 Wealth redistribution is the best possible economic development program because the wealthy don't spend as great a portion of their income as the poor do.
 Basic income is the most efficient possible form of wealth redistribution because there is no bureaucratic overhead needed to filter recipients, or find and punish abusers.
 Basic income as an alternative to public retirement pensions (such as social security in the US) is the only possible prevention of generational theft that will occur if the funding sustainability of future retiree pensions and care is threatened
 Reduced crime as a result of lower levels of desperation.
 Balanced power in the labour market as a result of not needing work out of desperation, and better competitive position of workers if some people choose not to work.
 Better work opportunities as a result of people better able to afford an education or business start up.
 Smaller government made possible and attractive by the alternative of increased basic income to offset any program cost reduction.  Viewed this way, the cost of every government program is paid for equally by each citizen, even if the source of government revenue is progressive income taxation.
 Social justice is achieved efficiently and automatically, with less requirement on charity and welfare.
 It is easier for volunteer home owners to help the poor and secluded through group homes by being able to rely on their certain income.  Its possible and easier for the disadvantaged to group up and help themselves in the same manner.
 Natural finance's definition of social dividends (variable basic income: tax revenue surplus over social program expenses) essentially allows the level of basic income paid to citizens to rise with economic, productivity, and automation growth. The affordability of basic income adjusts automatically to the performance of the economy.

f4476a1a6bf0a6a9,"""POSTED FROM MARYLAND TALK PAGE WITH ACKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM Thisisbossi

I'm getting the sense of a double standard for Maryland here. Why is Maryland the focus of this brigade when other state intros are equivalent? I’ve avoided posting in these discussions because it seems you guys are reluctant to seeing the truth and now I have to write a book to get my point across. Even still you will believe what you want to because of personal preference or you don’t “feel it belongs”. Most of all I’m sure you could care less about the state itself otherwise you wouldn’t object. But you want an answer so here it is...

If you think the intro to the Maryland page needs a rework then you have your work cut out for you because you’re going to have to change just about every other state. Case in point, this is the last paragraph from the Commonwealth of Virginia intro, 

 """"Virginia is known as the """"Mother of Presidents"""", because it is the birthplace of eight U.S. presidents (George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, James Monroe, William Henry Harrison, John Tyler, Zachary Taylor, and Woodrow Wilson), more than any other state. Most of the United States' early presidents were from the state. Virginia has also been known as the """"Mother of States"""", because portions of the original Colony subsequently became Kentucky, Indiana, Illinois, and West Virginia as well as some portions of Ohio.""""

How is that anymore relevant than proclaiming """"Maryland donated the land for Washington, D.C.""""? Doesn't talk about presidents from decades past and ceding portions of land belong in the History section according to you?

Not convinced? Here’s part of the intro from the State of Wisconsin, this should put your economic fears to rest,

Wisconsin's rural economy was originally based farming (especially dairy), mining, and lumbering. In the 20th century tourism became important, and many people living on former farms commuted to jobs elsewhere. Large-scale industrialization began in the late 19th century in the southeast of the state, with the city of Milwaukee as its major center. In recent decades, service industries, especially medicine and education, have become dominant. Wisconsin's landscape, largely shaped by the Wisconsin glaciation of the last Ice Age, makes the state popular for both tourism and many forms of outdoor recreation.

In previous version they were proclaiming fur trade!!! But it's a sin to proclaim the life sciences which has become the foremost important industry in Maryland right now?

Didn’t get the message? Try the Commonwealth of Massachusetts,

During the 19th century, Massachusetts transformed itself from a mainly agricultural economy to a manufacturing one, making use of its many rivers for power to operate factories for shoes, furniture, and clothing. Its economy declined in the early twentieth century when industry moved south in search of cheaper labor. A revitalization came in the 1970s when, nourished by the graduates of the area's many elite institutions of higher education, the Boston suburbs (particularly those around Route 128) became home to dozens of high-technology companies. Massachusetts' colleges and universities, as well as its technology sectors, continue to thrive.

The state is also considered a haven for progressive, liberal thought and often sends political candidates to the national scene, however, the four most recent presidential aspirants, Ted Kennedy, Michael Dukakis, Paul Tsongas, and John Kerry, were all unsuccessful. . Massachusetts was the home state of US Presidents John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Calvin Coolidge, and John F. Kennedy, and the birth state of George H. W. Bush.
As of 2006, Massachusetts is the only state in the union to legalize marriage of gay and lesbian couples.

Must I continue? It should be clear by now.

My version was hardly all about geography: it had a sentence touching upon its Civil War history as well as some information on its population and economy.

 Quoting emails 
Increasingly, some parties are quoting emails from the leaked archive (ex. . I thought that this was not to be done (""""No quoting of any email is to be done by persons other than the author or intended recipient(s)"""")? Am I mistaken? | talk  
I believe the intention of the provision you have quoted, is to prevent wide-scale quoting of entire emails and entire email exchanges; that is the assumption I will work off when taking affirmative action (as opposed to reactive action, such as this), although I invite you to have the Committee comment on my interpretation of it. Regardless, I'll ask Offliner to paraphrase what you wrote on the mailing list, although having him do this could be to your disadvantage as it provides him the opportunity to represent what you said on the mailing list in whatever way and with whatever language he chooses.   
Daniel, I don’t mind you removing my entire section (at your discretion) for as long as you read it, by going back to my post, and relating to the particulars listed in it. However, there’s nothing in the initial provisions of this case indicating that you’re supposed to prevent only wide-scale quoting of entire emails and email exchanges. – That is your own interpretation of the warning which needs to be confirmed by the Committee. Meanwhile, quoting of illegally accessed emails includes also explaining in ones own words what’s in those emails, which in a way is even worse, because paraphrasing other people is obviously tainted by personal agendas. Cheers,  talk 
Quoting, out-of-context and possibly doctored emails is creating, IMHO, more problems than paraphrasing, as it gives an air of legitimacy to this harassment campaign. PS. Offliner is not the ony party quoting @s, Russavia is doing that as well. | talk  
(edit conflict) I'm charged, as the Clerk of the case, to interpret the directives I receive. Until such a time as I am explicitly overruled by the Committee, how I interpret those directives is how the case will be run. I have interpreted the directives and disallowing the quoting of the contents of emails, allowing the subjects of emails, and allowing the paraphrasing of content of emails where said paraphrasing. If you're concerned about mis-paraphrasing, the other alternative is to give permission to be quoted; otherwise, your emails can and will be paraphrased within reason. If you believe a paraphrase is misleading, you are free to address it in your own evidence section.
These are the rules for the case.   
And in response to Piotrus, either allow yourself to be quoted explicitly, or refute the paraphrasing in your evidence section, or else appeal my decision to the Committee by email to arbcom-l@lists.wikimedia.org. I will be happy to have my interpretation, which is binding on the case absent a contrary directive from th",0,0,0,0,0,0

A poor start, sorry. The author seems to be totally mislead about both real history and the opinions on the table. First of all, no common two-nations table is possible (patent nonsense). Second, I object the following:
the passage from the Russian table speaking of the Kievan Rus. As someone suggested earlier, that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between Kievan Rus and modern Russia.

Regardless of any """"Ukrainian military"""" table, none of them may include the Red Army. This army was not only irrelevant to any of Ukrainian states (with very formal post-WWII exception), but also significantly anti-Ukrainian.

Bolsheviks? Are you suggesting that i shouldn't forcefully challenge the proposed introduction of the topic of Bolsheviks into this article??? That's roughly equivalent to the old red-baiting practice of calling union organizers commies.

But that's just one of the obvious examples, and therefore easy to challenge. An example of the more subtle bias that has crept in  the article has been edited to claim,

Union Busting is a term used by labor organizations and trade unions to describe the activities that may be undertaken by employers, their proxies, workers and in certain instances states and governments usually triggered by events such as picketing, card check, organizing, and strike actions...

In other words, the workers begin to organize, or the union takes some sort of concrete action, and there is a response.

Well, (the reader may conclude,) if the union advocates would just go away, everything would be peachy-keen.

But that doesn't hint at the reality faced by some of my friends and family who have worked at Wal-Mart, where even a vague rumor brings a special visit (together with their indoctrination program) the suits from their corporate union busting division. And they eavesdrop on phone and email conversations of their employees to pick out any such rumor. They've even used high tech bugs, and infiltrators to police their employees for any suggestion of concerted activity.

Or how about my nephew who worked as a chef for a major hotel chain; when a new corporate conglomerate bought out the chain, they issued an edict which they claimed was for """"the privacy of associates."""" Anyone employed at the hotel chain was no longer allowed to use the last name of any other employee, under any circumstances, except when required for official business. My nephew (who has never been a union activist) says it was an obvious new rule aimed at making it more difficult for employees to communicate with each other outside of their place of employment. He described it as pre-emptive union busting. Not in any sense a reaction to """"events such as picketing, card check, organizing, and strike actions..."""" 

In brief, this article used to be pretty well focused on the issue of union busting. But in some places it has been edited to create a false impression about the reality of union busting. I won't say the editors are biased, but the edits sure the heck are. Others may draw their own conclusions.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I was also caught off guard in that the other contributors to the site took me for a Neo-Nazi! (See comment from DLX to that effect.)

 BTW, John, can you take a look at the dispute (there is a BRIEF reference on my user page) involving user THF or Ted Frank. Do this only if you have time to look at all the backroundthere is a lot of it on his talk page, some on the talk page for tort reform in the united states, and some on sonic's rendezvous band's talk page and deletion discussion page. I believe this user has violated several rules and policies and, in general, the spirit and purpose of Wikipedia. I have asked Cool Hand Luke to look at this but so far he has not. He only made a comment about something I did in response to being attacked by this user. Thanks for your consideration. Perhaps DLX can look at this issue too. I hope that both of you have concluded from our earlier discussion that my approach may have been ill-considered, but my purpose and intent was to make a good-faith contribution, not to disrupt and certainly not to enforce any particular politically motivated point of view.

Request
Can someone do clean up the Philosophical and artistic gestures? It's really long-winded. 

It's a painting of a pipe. I call it abstract surrealism. Since surrealism was based off of freud, along with the conscious interpreation of visual perception, i call it surreal.  

Here we go again about the """"abstract"""" versus the """"representational"""" branches of surrealism!  SURREALISM IS AN ARTISTIC MOVEMENT! so one should not analyse it only in terms of painting.  Miró was not an abstract painter.  He vehemently denied this and detested """"abstract painting.""""  

I disagree. Wikipedia currently defines an art movement as """"a tendency or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal, followed by a group of artists during a restricted period of time"""", which surrealism clearly is, the tendency being towards weirdness. User2.0

I think that it is fairly undeniable that Surrealism was a movement (cf. the manifestos of Breton, the internal wrangling, etc.).  One may be able to interpret it is a non-artistic movement, especially considering its revolutionary politics, but I think that given the program laid out by Breton himself, surrealism is best understood as an artistic movement.  Of course, to describe it as simply the tendency """"towards weirdness"""" is to miss most (if not all) of what Surrealism (and certainly Magritte's work) was about (although I am certainly not accusing to previous poster of actually subscribing to such a view!).  07:24, Mar 1, 2005 (UTC)

 Title Beneath 

""""The title of the painting is written beneath it, seemingly a contradiction, but meaning that the image of the pipe is not itself a pipe."""" As far as I know (limited indeed), 'Ceci n'est pas une pipe' is written below it, not 'The Betrayal of Images', which is the generally accepted title of the work. Perhaps clarification may be worthwhile.  08:14, Feb 4, 2005 (UTC)

Fixed.  (talk) 19:08, Apr 25, 2005 (UTC)

 Treachery/Betrayal of Images 

Before my edit, the article contained two references to the translation of La trahison des images as The Betrayal of Images and one to The Treachery of Images. I changed the former to conform to the latter. My reasoning (besides the fact that I've always heard of this particular painting referred to as The Treachery... and never The Betrayal...) is that although the French trahison can mean either """"betrayal"""" or """"treachery,"""" the two English words have very distinct meanings  a betrayal is a treacherous action, and """"betrayal"""" without the indefinite article refers to specific treacherous acts being committed, whereas """"treachery"""" is the character trait of being prone to committing such acts  and Magritte seems to clearly mean that images can be deceptive by their nature, not that images are collectively committing a single act of betrayal. So The Treachery of Images seems to me to be the better translation.  

 The Young Gaze Scents the Festivity of the Old Tree 

I have done a web search for this title and couldn't find any matching images. The title however, was mentioned in an article on the website mysanantonio.com. You can visit the article by clicking here. The description in that article seems to match that of a work from 1950 titled The Legend of the Centuries, which already appears in the list. If anyone is familiar with this work they could run an image search for The Legend of the Centuries to see if it is the same.

77edd59733b7d224,"Liver Disorders
The liver is the second largest organ in your body and is located under your rib cage on the right side. It weighs about three pounds and is shaped like a football that is flat on one side. The liver performs many jobs in your body. It processes what you eat and drink into energy and nutrients your body can use. The liver also removes harmful substances from your blood. How does a healthy diet help the liver? Eating a healthy diet helps the liver to do its functions well and to do them for a long time.  Eating an unhealthy diet can lead to liver disease. For example, a person who eats a lot of fatty foods is at higher risk of being overweight and having non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. For people who have liver disease, eating a healthy diet makes it easier for the liver to do its jobs and can help repair some liver damage. An unhealthy diet can make the liver work very hard and can cause more damage to it. What does a healthy diet include? •Eating foods from all the food groups: grains, proteins, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and fats •Eating foods that have a lot of fiber such as fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain breads, rice and cereals Are there diet changes for those with liver disease? It is important for people with liver disease to maintain a healthy weight by eating a balanced diet with foods from all food groups. Also, •Do not eat uncooked shellfish such as oysters and clams •Limit eating foods that have a lot of sugar or salt Liver Diseases and Diet Some liver diseases have specific diet recommendations: Bile Duct Disease Bile is a liquid made in the liver that helps break down fats in the small intestine. Bile duct disease keeps bile from flowing to the small intestine. Diet Recommendations: • Use fat substitutes • Use kernel oil (i.e. canola, olive, corn, sunflower, peanut, flax seed oils) because it needs less bile to break down fats than other types of oil Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is the scarring and hardening of the liver. Diet Recommendations: •Limit salt and foods that contain a lot of salt •Talk to your doctor about how much protein to have in your diet Fatty Liver Disease Fatty liver disease is the build up of fat in liver cells. Diet Recommendations: •Limit foods that are high in calories •Eat foods that have fiber Hemochromatosis Hemochromatosis is the build up of iron in the liver. Diet Recommendations: •Do not eat foods that have iron •Do not use iron pots and pans •Do not take pills with iron •Do not eat uncooked shellfish Hepatitis C Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. Diet Recommendations: •Limit foods that have a lot of iron •Do not use iron pots and pans •Limit salt and foods that contain a lot of salt Wilson Disease Wilson disease is the build up of copper in the body. Diet Recommendations: •Limit foods that have copper such as chocolate, nuts, shellfish and mushrooms • Do not use copper pots •Limit eating fatty foodskawaljeet bhinder

Disruptive edits?  No - only correcting a falsehood re-inserted by the perpetrator, who took liberties with the """"consensus"""" decision that he was wildly off base.  Even in a footnote, his original research that islands in the Fraser River are """"not actually part of the continuous mainland"""" is fictitious and constitute digging in his heels on his position; I simply corrected his (ongoing) error and mis-use of language; he wants to mention the City of Richmond, not its main island (Lulu Island, which also includes about 1/3 of the City of New Westminster, namely Queensborough), yet his """"footnote"""" spoke of Richmond as an island.  I'm not the one making the disruptive edits.  Franamax, who's familiar with the area, also concurs about the notion that freshwater islands are obviously part of the mainland and distinct from offshore islands such as Bowen; and that same footnote also re-digs in the false notion that dictionary definitions have anything to do with the meaning of the name.  The RfC accomplished nothing, except the consensus refutation of any validity to his position, and rile my back up over something wildly silly in nature for no good reason; and the RfC closed, with the consensus that JimWae's position was wrong, but a footnote explaining , not asserting.  JimWae simply went ahead and reinserted his original problem-content as if it were all peachy keen and he had won.  But he didn't even get the English idiom """"contiguous mainland"""" correct, I corrected that; he also wanted to centre on the City of Richmond even though that's not, in and of itself, an island (it's about 20); I simply pointed out the absurdity of what he had added by adding other things that didn't fit the dictionary definitions attached to """"lower"""" and """"mainland"""".  If you give as license to absurdity, or tolerate it, then you have to tolerate absurdities ensuant on it with impartiality.  Rivers and lakes are not land, but they are part of """"the mainland"""", mountain peaks are not """"lower"""", but they are part of the Lower Mainland.  So either the RfC stands - with JimWae's assertions being dismissed as original research - or you are enforcing a selective interpretation of it forbidding anyone from altering what JimWae wants to add, even though his addition was not supported by the RfC.  *A* footnote was tolerated by the RfC, or suggested by it.  But nobody said """"let JimWae say whatever he wants so long as it's in footnote form"""".  And if he uses incorrect language/idiom, then anyone (including me) can correct it - the City of Richmond is not an island, and the expression """"continuous mainland"""" is not the correct English idiom for what he thinks he's saying. It's that simple.  You're welcome to reverse the consequent absurdities I've added; but if you do, and leave JimWae's false and original research as it is, then you have gone against the consensus of the RfC.....Lulu Island is in the Fraser River, not Georgia Strait, it's that simple; and the river is on the mainland, so what's in it is on the mainland.....if that needs to be explained in a footnote, it doesn't need to be explained in the way that JimWae put it; which was, again, simply his re-iteration of his original erroneous and original-research interpretation.....

That the citation author is unaware of the existence of something is not proof that it does not exist.  I am unaware of the existence of cylindrical celled zinc-carbon batteries, but I would never make the claim that they don't exist

In this case, the author of your reference is wrong.  The centre battery in the illustration to the right is of a flat celled alkaline battery.  Zinc-carbon (and indeed zinc-chloride) batteries are made using layer cells wrapped in a wax type coating, or even these days heat shrink plastic, for that is all that is required.  Alkaline cells generate gas during discharge, which is absorbed by the chemistry, though there is a delay.  As a result, some pressure does build up which requires a more substantial container.  In virtually all alkaline constructions, that container is made from steel.  Even a quick look at the centre battery shows rectangular cells made with steel containers.  No manufacturer of zinc-carbon batteries is going to go to that unnecessary expense. 

I have therefore reverted your edit.  If you wish to continue to insist that there are no rectangular celled alkaline batteries, then please provide a citation that the construction is impossible. 212.183.140.5  

Leclanché cells

To describe dry celled zinc-carbon as 'Leclanché' is completely incorrect.  Georges Leclanché did not invent, build, or even conceive of a dry version of his famous cell.  Indeed, the chemistry isn't even the same.  The electrolyte in the Leclanché cell is ammonium chloride.  The (paste) electrolyte in the dry zinc-carbon battery is a 50:50 mix of ammonium chloride and zinc chloride.  The difference gives the dry battery an e.m.f. of a little over 1.5 volts versus the Leclanché 1.4 volts.  Later, so called, high power versions of the cell dispensed with the ammonium chloride completely and just used zinc chloride.

In any case, the most common name for this type of cell is the zinc-carbon and that should therefore be what it is refered to in the article.  Few people (if anyone at all) call it anything other than a zinc-carbon.  I also cannot find any manufacturer who describes it as 'Leclanché'.  I have therefore reverted this as well. 212.183.140.5",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Extraterrestrial hypothesis 

Howdy.  You modified some changes I had made to the intro to ETH.  I had posted some commentary on the reasons behind the changes on the talk page; it would have been nice if you had commented there, especially since I left it open for commentary for over a month before I put the change in place ;-).  If you disliked the way it's written now, you should see what it said before I changed it.  And just removing the citation (which I spent quite some time finding) is not very helpful.  Anyway, other than my slightly bruised ego, your point about the citation not mentioning ETH is well taken.  Regardless of terminology they distinctly were *not* talking about ETH but about UFOs.  I will try to change it to reflect that.  What the citation supports is the notion that when scientists review the evidence at hand, they conclude that some UFO reports merit further study, but they don't really comment much on ETH.  E.g. the notion that there's even a minority support for ETH in mainstream science is wrong.  And leaving the comment """"a few scientists ..."""" is zero info, since you can pretty much find a """"a few"""" scientists supporting any notion.

I can cast some light on:

1. CZMarlin's contribution 

CZMarlin is a tireless promoter of AMC vehicles (he owns at least two and has a website dedicated to AMC products). As he knows, I have developed the view that he seems to use the project quite persistently as a PR medium for the defunct corporation and its products. It is, I believe, to this end that, it seems to me, he has habitually fought against sourced material that brings neutrality and balance to articles on AMC products, e.g. AMC Pacer, Gremlin etc.  

It is true that I was deeply frustrated by the apparent determination with which he misrepresented others’ contributions in order to justify their deletion, e.g. . I was also frustrated by his apparent insistence on idiosyncratic and erroneous interpretations of the English language, and also by what appeared to be deliberately erroneous interpretation of verifiable facts, e.g.   errors that cannot be permitted in an  encyclopedia.  

My sincere belief that English was not CZM’s first language arose from the manner in which he uses it and the difficulties of communicating with him. (Examples on request.) I disagree that I belittled him for it – as a non-native English speaker myself, it's not something I would do.  Indeed I offered to help him with the language (offer ignored) and told him he could seek help from WP volunteer translators, so that he could write in Polish (also ignored).  

True, I ridiculed him when his behaviour seemed so extreme as to appear ridiculous to me.  I should not have done so. But we get frustrated when we try to work with an editor who, it seems, demonstrates provocatively scant regard for factual accuracy, neutrality, balance and clarity of communication . Granted, I should not have let my frustration show. 

The 'known vandal' CZM mentions is in fact an IP address used by one or more people. The address had a history of vandalism. When I saw a constructive edit from it I tried to encourage the contributor in her/his constructive behaviour; and later suggested the sandbox for experiments:  , . My posts encouraged constructive behaviour. 

CZM's damaging claim that these posts encouraged disruptive behaviour is totally false. (This gives a flavour of the difficulties I had with him.) It also casts serious doubt on the reliability of his contribution here, and also on his good faith.

He implies that my use of the term 'AMC cuckoos' was insulting. Not so, as he well knows, because I explained it to him when he showed that he had misunderstood the idiom: I used the term in an edit summary to describe the long-winded and inappropriate descriptions of certain AMC cars that he had introduced  like cuckoos in a nest  into an article on a certain aspect of automotive aerodynamics .

My  'another sophomoric CZM error' was mischievous but (IMO) harmless retaliation for CZM’s previous sniffy dismissal of some Google research I had posted to a discussion, which he denigrated as 'sophomoric research'. He seems to have forgotten that.  

The reference to 'little fuhrer' is more serious, and I should not have used it even though it mentioned no names (so no harm done to CZM’s reputation). Why that particular metaphor? I’m afraid I regarded CZM’s approach to editing as uncollaborative and perfunctory to the point of being dictatorial; and ruthless in its uncritical promotion of AMC and its products.

2. Collect’s contribution 

Just as he could list my transgressions (""""I have a list of [Writegeist's] comments""""), so also could I recite a litany of his own. Meh. Tit for tat gets us nowhere.

However it is worth noting that an antagonism grew between us at the Sarah Palin pages when it became apparent to Collect that I disagreed with much of his input, whereas he had assumed from one of my earliest contributions there that I would be an ally (he left an appreciative note on my Talk).

 Knight undoing 

""""This is simply meant to illustrate a fork, it isn't intended to show all of the pieces and isn't intended to be a game""""

It may have originally been intended only to show that... But there's no reason not to use this situation to show the reader both one of the knight's advantages and one of it's weaknesses. It's really a very good example of that, which by the way the text adjacent to it describes. In fact, as I read the mentioned text, I even expected that picture to show me that. And frankly, it's a better example of that weakness than the picture which shows a black knight, its possible moves, and a cornered knight with only two possible moves. So I suggest either undoing your undoing or perhaps adding a new picture, with the knight cornered after taking the rook there.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Reliability of U2gigs.com 

I know that there's been discussion of the reliability of U2gigs.com, but I just came across 2 print sources where the site is referenced.  The first is the 2009 book U2: A Musical Biography.  I don't have a copy of the book but a search at Google Books shows that the site is mentioned in the book.  The second is at the very bottom of the page in a 2007 issue of Billboard in a brief article about the songs played on the Vertigo Tour (link).  It's cited as u2-vertigo-tour.com (which, as your probably know, is the old url of U2gigs.com and typing it in will redirect you to the new site).  I actually just referenced this article from Billboard for the """"Streets"""" article, but it seems pretty redundant since I might have well have cited the website directly. Elevation-tour.com is cited in the book U2 Live: A Concert Documentary, and according to U2gigs' FAQ, Elevation-tour.com uses their database.  Let me know your thoughts. –  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Firstly, """"fair use"""" does not mean you can just take whatever copyrighted material you like and use it.  Non-free content cannot be used in cases where a free content equivalent, with an acceptable quality sufficient to serve the encyclopedic purpose, is available or could be created.  Lifting a definition from an external source, instead of writing your own, is not an example of fair use.
Secondly, as you seem to think that something can only be redundant if it's an exact copy, let's have a look at the two definitions, piece by piece:
 Wikipedia definition Copied definition Comparison A tax (from the Latin taxo; """"rate"""") is a financial charge or other levy According to Black's Law Dictionary, a tax is a """"pecuniary burden Equivalent in meaningimposed upon a taxpayer (an individual or legal entity)laid upon individuals or property owners Equivalent in meaningby a state or the functional equivalent of a stateto support the government [...] a payment exacted by legislative authority.""""  Equivalent in meaningsuch that failure to pay is punishable by law.It """"is not a voluntary payment or donation, but an enforced contribution, exacted pursuant to legislative authority""""  Equivalent in meaningTaxes are also imposed by many administrative divisions. Taxes consist of direct or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent.and is """"any contribution imposed by government [...] whether under the name of toll, tribute, tallage, gabel, impost, duty, custom, excise, subsidy, aid, supply, or other name."""" Oooh!  Slightly different.  And how very useful a list of obscure alternative words for """"tax"""" is too.
If you really, desperately need to include the list of obscure alternative words for """"tax"""", the way to do it is to list some of the terms, and cite the source from which they came.  Simple, huh?  The way not to do it is to copy and paste the entire chunk of text verbatim.
And thirdly, you may be flabbergasted to know that IP addresses are often not static.  The first edit from this IP address is from yesterday.  The first edit from this editor was in 2004.  There is no contradiction there, despite what you seem to want to believe.  201.215.252.50  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Films

Hi Nehrams hope your studies are going well and are off on vacation. First have you ever considered some new parameters to the film template -including genre, art direction, casting, second unit director, costume design for example. Also do you think its worth setting up a branch of film WPFilms/Westerns to conentrate on improving western film articles -I know a number of members who would be interested. 

You'll be pleased to know I have created two new templates for film images  these include  Template:Filmrationale  (for screenshots and posters)  and Template:Filmbiorationale (for all deceased film people). I regularly upload many images and it is SOOO! much easier. It has been long awaited and already many users are beginning to use them. For normal bios use Template:Biorationale

I have noticed a crackdown on images to the point that it is seriously affectig our articles, For instance Cinema of the UNited States looks ridiculous with no images. Surely there is even an image of CHarlie Chaplin which is publuic domain? I really hope our images will remain including our main film reel icons which were supposed to be deleted July 1.

I have begun an enormous task of compiling the list of American films in which I have asked the project to help out. Any contribution even if it is adding one or two details particularly 1960-present is really needed.

 The apotropaic powers of inscriptions 

""""Äpotropaic"""" means """"to turn away"""": the idea was that a demon could be turned away from a house etc by displaying a holy text (or at least a magical text) near the door. The inscription therefore had to be clearly visible - at head-level, and outside the door (no point in letting your demon come inside before he could read the magic). The Tel Yayit stone doesn't fulfill these criteria: it was being used in an internal wall, inside a dark room, was about 3 feet off the ground, and was very faint. The archaeologists who found it missed it themselves until the last day of excavation, when they just happened to see it early one morning in ideal conditions, in the low raking light of the rising sun. Tho the setting sun would have done just as well. But the point is, in a dark room 3 feet off the ground, no demon is going to see it or read it, and even if he were a midget-demon, he's already inside, so what's the point? So, no apotropaic powers for this stone.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dai, ydych chi'n siarad Cymraeg? I love that language. I studied it a long time ago, but unfortunately I've forgotten most of it. Let's see, what were you asking? If I have considered checking my edits? And you were informing me about the """"Show preview"""" box? Ha-ha-ha! Very funny. Have you considered checking how long a user has been on Wikipedia and how many edits he's made before asking that question? So, here is some information for you: User:Daicaregos, First edit: Apr 21, 2008, Unique articles edited: 533. User:Pasquale, First edit: Jun 24, 2004, Unique articles edited: 1,461. As you can see, I've been on the Wikipedia for five and a half years. And, yes, I always use """"Show preview"""" function.

However, I did screw up when I undid your edit, because, when I compared the two versions, all I could see was the removal of the Union Jack . Of course, your Edit summary said """"Repair Wikilink, tidy"""", so I suspected there was something else I wasn't seeing, but, much as I stared, I could not see the link fix. (Needless to say, when I went back now, I saw it right away.)

Look, if I could vote for Welsh independence tomorrow, I would do it. I'm all for it. Ditto for all the other unrepresented nationalities. But what I can't stand is when people take their nationalistic battles to the Wikipedia. Is Wales one of the United Kingdom's constituent countries, whether one likes it or not? I noticed you did not remove that part, so I must conclude you agree. But you chose to remove the flagicon and referred to that particular edit as """"tidy""""! (Again, very funny, not to mention a little tricky.) Well that flagicon is also shown next to England and Scotland in the List of country name etymologies, so in order to """"tidy"""" up the whole article you should remove it in all three places! But you didn't. Hence the inconsistency.

Frankly, I don't understand where you find the cheek to refer to my restoration of the previous status quo as """"removing edits I just don't like"""" and as a """"simple/simplistic knee-jerk response"""". Are you kidding me? That is ridiculous and disingenuous. Now, having said that, let me join you in saying Cymru am byth!    

Hi Pasquale, ydw. Dw'n siarad Cymraeg, diolch. I've moved your reply here for two reasons. 1. to keep it in one place. 2. to remove the union flag from my talk page (and you call my edits tricky and disingenuous). Glad you enjoyed my joke. I note your failure to WP:AGF for my edit and your accusation of nationalistic bias. Let me talk you through my process: I had seen that an editor (turns out to have been you) had consolidated the Cymru and Wales entries, but had made an error in the process (the one I corrected). I noticed the union flag had been added - which had not been on the Cymru entry previously - and that other (non-sovereign) countries (visible from W down) do not have the flags of the sovereign states that govern them. e.g: Wake Island (territory of the United States of America)Wallis and Futuna (territory of France)Western Sahara (claimed by Morocco and the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic)I went to the beginning of the article to check that other (non-sovereign) countries do not have the flags of the sovereign states that govern them either. e.g.: Åland (autonomous province of Finland):American Samoa (territory of the United States of America):Anguilla (overseas territory of the United Kingdom):Aruba (territory of Netherlands)Therefore, as far as I could tell (although I concede that I should have checked the entire article for British nationalist bias), additional, sovereign state flag icons were not used on the article, and the one on the Wales entry was therefore unnecessary, which is why I removed it - thus tidying the article. That is how I found """"the cheek to refer to [your] restoration of the previous status quo as """"removing edits [you] just don't like"""" and as a """"simple/simplistic knee-jerk response""""."""" Which seems justified. It remains to be seen how you deal with the apparent inconsistency in the article. Hwyl,   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Fair use rationale for Image:Jwhits.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Jwhits.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any non-free media lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

 Response. I find it somewhat ironic that you're criticizing me for taking the exact actions you took. I noticed a page which I honestly felt (and still do) does not meet any of the 12 pts. in WP:MUSIC. I have no interest in their music or their entry. I only noticed them because I took the time to research the type of articles you wrote while nominating mine for deletion. When I looked at them it became obvious that they are non-notable per WP:MUSIC. I nominated the the articles and I then made pertinent comments in that AFD as any nominator would. I never accused you do doing anything surreptitiously, just pointed out that you had an interest in the outcome of the decision beyond simply being the author of the article. I even broached the bad faith subject. If you were conficent that the articles satisfied WP:MUSIC then you should have stated so in a reasoned, sourced, referenced argument and allowed it to stand up to scrutiny. If the consensus was that they met notability standards (beyond your simple assertion that they did) then the articles would have withstood review. I even offered to change my opinion if you could demonstrate notability. Last I heard, """"because WebHamster"""" says so is not a reliable independent source that i am aware of, nor is that stated anywhere on in WP.

 New page patrolling 

Please see this thread and consider giving new page creators some breathing room before tagging their pages for deletion. In this case, you tagged within 2 minutes of creation. Unless it's an attack page or something, give the editor some time to work with the article. Thanks, –xenotalk 
Admittedly I was on the fence in regards to this article and perhaps should have simply tagged it for improvement or as a stub. I allowed my review of the creator's block log to skew my opinion on an unreferenced bio. And I realize I misunderstood the inapplicability of G4's to speedy deletes.
But in general, as a NP patroller I feel that my purpose is to filter pages on creation.  With the volume of speedy deletes we generate, there are going to be occasional disputes regarding our reasoning.  However, in the vast majority these proposals for deletion are necessary soon after creation or the article will be lose the benefit of input from an experienced editor unless someone on recent changes happens to notice the article as it is being modified. If bad articles slip past this initial screening I feel it would increase the workload of the pool of editors as a whole.  This is just my own personal philosophy and I will attempt to avoid causing you too many headaches in the future.

His previous full lupine state allowed him to lift only 1 ton.  Sabreooth can lift at least 900 lbs.

Berkshires,

Perhaps you say that you agree with the quoted statement, but you don't seem to get it.

Yes it is true that the Beth Din will not/didn't decide who is or should be a Rebbe to whom. They never took that power to themselves nor can I imagine that such power can even be granted. But of course they were granted the power to decide who is the """"Bobover Rebbe"""", who can use the name Bobov.

Berkshires this is an obvious distinction, one that I previously thought you were faking ignorance of. I now realise that you may have very well been serious. I will therefore try to explain it in more detail.

Think for a moment, if Rabbi Halberstam should decide tommorow that he no longer wants the title Bobover Rebbe, he no longer wants he Kehilla to be named Bobov, but rather some name of some other polish town. Does that render him no longer Rebbe to his Chasidim? The connection between a Rebbe and a Chossid has absolutley nothing to do with his title.

There was a dispute in Bobov over assets, over the title, and over usage of the name Bobov and other names used by Bobov. A very simple dry Din Torah. The Beth din  gave to Rabbi Halberstam side all of Bobov assets, the rights to the title, the name Bobov, and all other names used by Bobov. That does not mean that Rabbi Unger isn't a Rebbe? It doesn't even mean that he isn't a """"mamshich"""" of his father-in-law or grandfather-in-law. The same way the first Bobover Ruv did not have the title Sanzer ruv but he was still a """"mamshich"""" of Sanzer Ruv.

Try to remove your emotions and be impartial and you may even understand the Beth Din's logic. I am not saying you need to agree, but perhpas if you stand back for a moment you can understand their decision.

Putting aside all claims and counter claims as to who should have been selcted as the Rebbe of Bobov, I know you must believe that the son-in-law should have been selected, however there is almost unanimous consent between all Poskim that the will of the majority is respected. The Beth Din made a clear finding within the Psak that Side 2 had a majority.

If you follow that logic the Psak is self explanatory. You have a Kehilla. They made a decision as to their Rav and Rebbe. A minority is unhappy. They leave. Can they get a part of the assets? Can they use the name and title? The Beth Din answered that question with its ruling.

I went long here only because I feel a sort of denialist anger simmering within your writting, and I don't think it is warranted. I thought perhaps you can follow the logic.

In any event the Beth din did make a decsion who has and can use the title Bobover Rebbe. Rabbi Unger can no longer refer to himself as Bobover Rebbe. 

It would be appropriate for you to give this a rest.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The problem we have at the moment is that the entire section needs sourcingand while I have sources for some of it, many of these are not sources I will link to in a wiki article.  The alumni sites for example are run very well and would certainly meet sourcing requirements, but also have individuals personal information on them and I'm strongly against linking to those as sources, especially as the new website does not provide links to the alumni pages, but let's alumni voluntarily provide information about themselves.
I had planned to go up the school at somepoint soon and use the library copies of old yearbooks and check and cite thoseI also think that the school does have alumni information, I'm just wrong about where it is kept.
But from what I could find on Megan Follows didn't give me any reason to remove it that I didn't have for every other alumni who isn't cited.
I also think that removing all alumni who are redlinked is a bad idea.  A redlink is a tip-off that it should be looked into, but redlinks are one of the ways that people know that something hasn't been written about and they do it.

 Articles for creation/Miriam Battista 

Hi Arctic Kangaroo,

I'm totally puzzled by the reasons you gave for rejecting this article Wikipedia talk:Articles for creation:/Miriam Battista. Miriam Battista is definitely """" 'worthy of notice' – that is, 'significant, interesting, or unusual enough to deserve attention or to be recorded'."""" It's true that her moment of national fame was short, but it was intense, and she continued to be noticed in the press as an adult actress. Also, the fact that she received a news obit (not paid for by the family) in the New York Times should in itself attest to her notability, since the obit was published so many years after her heyday. For comparison, please look at the article for Gladys Hulette. I certainly think that Battista rises to at least the same level of notability.

As far as verifiable references are concerned, I truly thought I had over-referenced if anything! There are references to Charles Donald Fox's book Famous Film Folk, Photoplay, Variety, The New Yorker, the New York Times, the Internet Broadway Database, and Internet Movie Database - are these not considered reliable, verifiable sources? If the problem is that I used too many references to privately held materials, I apologize for that, but I thought that the information they included was interesting and enlightening. I guess that raises a basic question for me: would Wikipedia prefer that information from privately held materials be omitted, even if it sheds light on the subject? If the answer is """"Yes,"""" I'm afraid that Wikipedia is missing out on a gold mine of material.

I had been considering trying to get in touch with Wikipedia editors who are working on WikiProject Biography, as well as those involved in WikiProject Film before submitting this article for review, but as a newbie I wasn't sure how to do that. Now that the article has been rejected, I would very much like to get feedback directly from anyone involved in those two projects, as well as more feedback from you. Perhaps you can show me how to connect with those projects.

Frankly, no one has seemed to have a problem figuring it out, so I'm not sure anyone's been seriously mislead to begin with. I'm not hiding my writing style or anything.
E.g. 
My use of wikipedia being my *reading* use, as is made clear by the statement """"those orange banners are annoying."""" I didn't evade the block until such point when I thought it had been communicated that editing under a different IP wouldn't be considered evasion. As User:Dennis Brown pointed out to me, IP addresses aren't humans; they're more akin to telephone numbers. It follows that a block applied to a telephone number applies to that telephone number. If the intention was to stop me, personally, from editing Wikipedia, shouldn't it have been a ban? (Also, you must be aware that statements like """"to twist logic in your defense"""" fail to AGF.)
At this point, I'm pretty sure that everyone has taken it as granted that I'm being deceptive simply by choosing not to register for an account. If that's the case, this really doesn't seem like the encyclopedia that anyone is encouraged to edit boldly. Also, you're misconstruing what I admitted (see above.)
Lastly, (and this relates to all of your points in general), you yourself said that it was reasonable to invoke IAR (above) in order to improve Wikipedia, despite the block. If that was the case for calling attention to a bad edit, why not a bad policy?

Michael and Adam,

Funny that you both accuse me of idealogical motivations. What are yours? I am motivated by the principle a calling a spade a spade. WAP and racially restricted immigration - not racist?? come on. 
Michael, nice innuendo. What are people """"like myself"""" like? Until I started pressing/searching for the full quotation, this page did not contain the all important quote (even now it's hidden at the bottom, under ACs post hoc justifications). Only snide remarks. 
Adam, given that you appear to believe you own this page, why not add some historical value rather than merely attempting a snow job. There is plenty out there on AC's huge contribution to post-war migration. Detailing that would be the best way to provide some balance.

The truth is, if of any interest to you, that I happened to come across this article while researching something altogether different and thought, if this was a long persisting claim by some, that she didn't write it, then it should be added. It required a section/subheading. Instead of removal you could've moved it. I don't mind expanding, though it appears you know more on the topic than me.

Mr. Swordfish, you wrote """"it would be absurd say it was the other way around, i.e. to insist that you are making the bus speed up by pressing on the back of your seat.""""

Did you mean to say, """"it would be absurd say it was the other way around, i.e. to insist that you are creating a force on your back by accelerating."""" ?

I think so.  You were making the (good) point that simply reversing F and a in the cause and effect statement seems intuitively absurd in this case.  But the F in statement 1 is the forward force exerted on the back, not the backward force by the back, and the a is the acceleration of the person, not of the bus.

If we make the reversal one of switching equal and opposite forces carefully, we come up with """"The backward force of the back on the bus causes the acceleration of the bus to be lower than it otherwise would be"""" which is different than the way you wrote it.  In this case there is no intuitive absurdity at all.  Both cause and effect statements are equally intuitive.

Crowsfoot is right that F=ma, or its fluid dynamics equivalent, doesn't by itself indicate an asymmetric cause and effect relationship.  If causes must precede effects, then we could even argue that F=ma forbids a either causal interpretation, since it refers to instantaneous values of both F and a (and m).  

But its helpful to the reader, I think, to go with the intuitively appealing bias that net forces (pressure differences) cause accelerations (of bodies or particles, or for us, of differential volumes of fluid).  The real difficulty comes when the reader wants to know if the pressure field is caused by the flow field, or vice versa.  We must get him/r to abandon this truly meaningless question, I believe, and understand that Newton's differential equation, and the continuity and mass conservation constraints all have to hold at the same time.  The infinite set of 3d velocity vectors and the infinite set of local pressures have to be consistent with each other, and there is no intuitively meaningful way to say that one causes the other.

Which of the places on the list are notable enough for separate articles (if they don't have one now)?  I've added links to articles where I could them.  I'd say articles are also needed at least for Sugar Creek,  Red Butte, Rocky Ridge, Echo Canyon, and Emigration Canyon.  A couple of points of interest that could be added are Genoa, Nebraska (settled by the Latter-day Saints as a supply point) and This Is The Place Heritage Park.  I'm sure other landmarks will be identified with additional research.
Which places could be reasonably combined in sections, like the eastern Wyoming sites? Some suggested sections:  Iowa (mostly covering the 1840s); the Missouri River area (Winter Quarters / Kanesville / Florence); Missouri River to Fort Laramie; For Laramie to Fort Bridger (with a focus on the handcart companies); and Fort Bridger to Salt Lake Valley.  The Iowa section could include a brief subsection on the route used by the handcart companies from Iowa City to Florence.
And how are we to deal with elapsed time, as early companies had different experiences than later companies?  One chunk for geography and another for linear time? I think the organization of the Mormon Trail article should focus on geography.  Content that is intrinsically chronological could be moved to the Mormon Pioneer article.

There has been a corresponding increase in the number and popularity of

publicly hosted Web sites for sharing digital photos. But is it safe to share

personal photos ? After all, personal photos contain personal information about

you and your family, your interests and hobbies.

Safety in this context means that the personal information, which can be

identified and extracted from these photos, is both private and secure.

Private means that access to the information can be restricted to the use

of a particular person or group of people. The owner of the information

should control who has access to it.

Secure means free from danger and risk of loss, i.e., making sure that the

bad guys out there cannot access your information.

A photo-sharing Web site lets members upload and annotate photos that are

posted on its site.Some sites offer these services for free, while others charge

a fee, sometimes only for additional storage. In general, these sites make

money by charging for prints, cards, and gifts such as calendars or coffee

mugs imprinted with the photos. Members can share their photos by sending

friends and family the URL of their photo site. Sometimes, visitors must enter

a username and password in order to view your pictures. Sometimes, this

information is embedded in the URL. As more people post their pictures online,

others are finding ways to exploit them.",0,0,0,0,0,0

It is therefore always better to rewrite.

If the consensus is against having these elaborate charts on bio pages, I won't object. I don't see them as problematic, though I can accept that others might.

No contention, I think it is a good thing, and I am wondering how to do it where the election data is owned by the election article or a template.  The bad thing is to have several copies of the data- one in each candidate article- floating around.

One way is to have,
 Template:Election X (this has data)
 Page:Election X
contains other narrative text (contentious, result of dissolution, highlights, etc)
Electoral results
 {{Election X}}
 Template:Election Y (this has data)
 Page:Election Y
contains other narrative text (dull, scandals, highlights, etc)
Electoral results
 {{Election X}}
 Page:Joe Everyman

I disagree with the analysis of John Z. Remember, in 1967 Israel agreed to UN Resolution 242 while Arab states rejected it... I think it is futile to draw conclusions about the outcome of the war based on what different leaders of Egypt and Israel agreed to at different times, if only because these decisions have as much to do with domestic and global situations as with the bi-lateral and regional conflict itself. In case of Sadat's peace initiative, the Israeli postion was also largely determined by the style in which it was presented. But, again, I agree with you completely that one-word interpretations have no place in the infobox or lead, and arguably, in the article. Instead, arguments from different sources and on different aspects need to be all presented and contrasted. No conclusion is warranted.  
 That simply isn't true about SC 242, though it is a common misapprehension.  See our article (or more comprehensible, less battleground-like old versions). Egypt and Jordan immediately accepted SC 242, while Israel neither accepted nor rejected it. During 1968 it at first privately to the UN Secretary General, and later publicly, gradually accepted SC242. A clear Israeli public acceptance including the word """"withdrawal"""" was not made until August 1970 as part of the Israeli-Egyptian-Jordanian acceptance of the Rogers B plan; it was controversial enough to induce Begin to resign from the cabinet.  See Shlaim's Iron Wall, p. 260 & p. 296.  

Yet again; this complex issue needs to be properly explored within the article body. I think that certain strategic benefits were seen by Israel (along with some drawbacks, as noted - mostly prompting renewed negotiation). Israel successfully defended itself, and held off joint armies again - this has probably prevented additional military adventures against Israel.
Constantly """"grandstanding"""" in the infobox is a futile exercise, editors should use their energies more effectively by creating a comprehensive explanation.   

This User Talk Page message concerns me. First, it accuses me of POV-pushing when I was reverting POV-pushing by an editor who has been changing a number of conflict infoboxes to """"Israeli Victory"""". More importantly, it could be regarded as Canvassing, and also suggests a strategic calculation to identify and sway """"sidelines"""" editors to a particular side. Might I remind editors that Wikipedia is not a battleground. Respectfully,   

=In battlefield terms the war ended with a clear Israeli victory.
After the 3rd army became trapped, Egypt's situation was desperate.
Among all warring parties, Egypt was the only one that asked desperately for a truce.
Not Israel.
Not even Syria whose capital was shelled.
This was confirmed not only by Israeli and American sources but also by the Soviet ambassador in Cairo that time.

=In regarding to political achievements gained by Egypt as a direct result of the war, 
I am quite not sure there is a consensus about this.
Not any one in Egypt saw the Camp David accord positively.
Shazly claim that this was a humiliating deal that caused the expulsion of Egypt from the Arab league.
If it was up to him, or up to the assassins of Sadat, this accord was never to be signed.

=Some may claim that only as a result of the war Israel accepted an Egyptian offer that it refused to accept earlier.
This statement is also problematic.
The peace accord was signed 5 years after war ended.
There were many other events that took place during those 5 years which made Israel agree giving back the entire Sinai Peninsula.
For example:
Before the war Israel offered Egypt a partition of the Sinai Peninsula.
Egypt will get the western Sinai in condition for peace with Israel and Israel will have the eastern part, from the 1967 border to Sharm El Sheich.
More than a year after the war ended the U.S. secretary of state Henry Kissinger threatened Israel that the US will not deliver F-15 airplanes to Israel unless it would agree to withdraw unilaterally from the western Sinai Peninsula.
Thus the Sinai Interim Agreement of 1975 made Israel losing a fundamental play card in the negotiation with Egypt, but receiving the F-15 and more arms in the future.
The US also started to deliver arms to Egypt in 1976 and Israel had to accept counter balancing guar",0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm guess you're monitoring Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Actors and Filmmakers, where an interesting proposal has been made on the colors of the Actor infobox. I'm leaning towards gold, but am like you - I'd like to see one default color.

Thai film list
Over at the , I ran into a problem with the box being too long and it was running into the year heading for the 1920s films. So I changed the map image to one that was horizontal. I think the svg locator-map renderings are more appropriate. They have been made for every country, are a standard size and easier to discern than the satellite images. It's something to consider  not that I'm trying to add to your workload. I was just having a problem with the Thai film list, and that's the solution I came up with. I hope you understand. However, these locator maps might also prove to be workable for the regional cinema templates that contain the soon-to-be-deleted film reel image, if only just temporarily until a more """"filmy"""" image is located.

Oh, thanks for adding the Tony Jaa photo to Cinema of Thailand. It was one I took a couple of years ago, and is out of focus. I've never liked it that much, but uploaded it out of desperation when I had nothing else. I moved it  lower on the page and added a caption. My favorite photo so far is the one of the Siam Theater marquee when it was playing The Tin Mine, and the marquee was Thai characters. That, to me, is the cinema of Thailand, literally. I try to take my camera to press preview events when I get the chance. The free-use photos have so much more flexibility than the gol-durned fair-use images, which are becoming increasingly problematic and restrictive. I fear that in the near future, most, if not all, fair-use images will be banned from English Wikipedia.

Well, enough from me. I should sleep, or maybe knock out some film icons. — ''''''Kwai """,0,0,0,0,0,0

That quote discusses what happens to the penis after circumcision, which is not what the article is about. The sentence may use the word """"foreskin"""" but it is clearly a quote that is directly related to circumcision, rather than the foreskin, thus it is off-topic, and does not belong in the article. The only part of the sentence directly related to the foreskin is """"nerve endings in the foreskin,"""" and that section by itself doesn't add much to the article.

Allowing material that discusses what happens to the penis after the foreskin is removed would allow the entire Sexual effects of circumcision and Medical analysis of circumcision articles to be copied to Foreskin. When taken to this extreme, it's quite evident that discussing what happens to the penis when the foreskin is removed is beyond the scope of this article. If readers wish to learn about what happens to the penis when the foreskin is removed, there are plenty of circumcision-related pages that are directly related to that topic on wikipedia, and we already link to them from the Foreskin article.

It appears that the article is being used as a soapbox for discussing circumcision because of the number of sentences devoted to circumcision in the article. If it was just one or two sentences, I would not have a basis for making this accusation, but as we can see from this diff (your revert conveniently shows all three of my edits, so I'm using that rather than listing them individually), the amount of off-topic text devoted to circumcision is substantial.

By the way, since we're discussing content again, I'm happy to go back to the Foreskin talk page, so that other editors can participate in the conversation. Thanks for continuing our discussion, I think we're getting somewhere again. However, I also note that you have now been reverted by two other editors, indicating a lack of consensus for including the material in question, so I'm not sure if further discussion is necessary, but I'm happy to continue the discussion if you wish.

 Article Name Change (PROTECTION OF PAGE AND VOTING) 
Calling the film """"Cloverfield (creature)"""" seems to indicate that the creature is actually named Cloverfield. Seeing that there is no cite that I have seen confirming this, and, just as well, the first sentence of the article notes that the being is """"unidentified,"""" I personally don't see why this article is named such. Shouldn't the article's title be changed? I think it should be called """"Cloverfield Monster,"""" without the parenthesis. Is this fact... 
Don't like """"Cloverfield Monster,"""" but I have been wondering if we shouldn't move it to something like """"Creature (Cloverfield)"""" or """"Monster (Cloverfield)"""".  Nither of those are particularly good, either.  The problem is that given that the thing doesn't appear to have any proper name, there's really no perfect place for the article to go right now.  Using a generic noun with (Cloverfield) after it seems to have the appropriate vagueness.  The producers tend to refer to it as 'creature', but most third-party sources are calling it a 'monster.'  We may as well flip a coin, really.  
I should also add that I don't hate where the article is now, either, though.  Like I said, naming an article on something that doesn't have a name is frustrating.    | Talk 
The movie's opening """"titles"""" say """"US DOD... Multiple sightings of case designate """"Cloverfield"""""""". Best we can go with. '  
I believe that refers to the case itself or the code name of the camera, not the monster.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 65.34.244.213   
This has already be discussed in previous sections of the talk.  It seems the general concensous is, no it isn't an ideal title, but since we have nothing better, there isn't sufficient motivation to move it.  """"Cloverfield monster"""" is certainly a likely candidate, but without an extremely reliable source, such as an official designation from the creative property holder, we may as well leave it where it is until such a source comes into existence.  A sequel looks rather undoubtable, and I should think chances are pretty good it will get a name within the fictional universe then. -  
I think """"Cloverfield (creature)"""" seems fine.  Hello all,
The citation provided in the intro which apparently backs up the (not so fact) fact of Matt Reeves stating it is the name of the creature is not mentioned in the citation at all. He only explains why it is the title of the movie, it was a codename named after a Paramount property which stuck with the project, There were other codenames such as Slusho and Bertha.

However my point is not this, but the fact that the name of the creature is not Cloverfield but in fact the name of the military operation assigned to tackle the creature, as the film stated itself """"Case designated Cloverfield"""", ha, not only this but the director itself has stated it is applied to the military operation, if you would be so kind to read the [2] citation in the intro I have provided. Hows that for an official designation from the creative property holder. Now good day to all, and this is why the article should be The Cloverfield creature. '  

I also question the quality of the source given, but that is discussed below.  I don't feel The Cloverfield creature is an appropriate title for this article either.  For one thing, there are two """"creatures"""" in cloverfield, the main creature, and the parasites, both of which are discussed in this article.  For another thing, it sounds too official.  """"The Cloverfield creature"""" is not it's official name either.  I think it is much better to just leave it as Cloverfield_(creature) and wait for more sources.  Eventually the creature will get a name, and at that point the page will just have to move again, so I'd like to see a stronger argument for why your name choice, or any other, is optimal and signifigantly better than it's original name. -[[Use",0,0,0,0,0,0

Brute-force enumeration ceases to be practical much earlier: the number of unique 2-colourings of a graph on 18 nodes is already an intractable 1.788*1030.
The main reason is that it is simply not true. Nobody would try to look at all possible colourings one at a time as there are much better ways.  Looking at all colourings is not possible for graphs of size greater than 13 (and very expensive for size 13), yet many larger Ramsey numbers can be found exactly via computer search.

So ,Szopen, Culmerland was not Polish land- it was Prussian land, partially conquered temporarily by Poland.

2) Abraham to the best of my knowledge is not recorded in Genesis as using a calendar of any sort. The citation attached this statement refers to Moses, an entirely different figure.

3) Abraham is a legendary figure who may or may not have existed, and who is only referred to in the books of the bible, written hundreds or thousands of years after his supposed death.  I don't want to start a fight on religion, but his historicity is certainly up for debate, and a citation of a 100-year-old encyclopedia from a religious institution based in part the Abraham narrative isn't really a reliable source.

Surely the ancient Jewish use of the seven-day week ought to be mentioned in the lede, as it is the ultimate origin of the West's seven-day week, but the first sentence as currently written is nonsense.  Any suggestions on rewrites?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Arthashastra in modern literature

I have seen a modern literature section in here off and on. Keeps getting reverted in the name of trivia. However, the author Brad Thor has an article, the mentioning of Arthashastra is an uncommon topic in modern literature and in the book several true recipes for poisons, bio-warfare and chemical warfare are mentioned. All gleaned from Arthashastra. I do not care to get into a silly edit war and considering the people watching this article for this fact Modern Literature """"trivia nonsense"""" alone, I would also ask for an outside opinion.    98.214.81.82  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 In Response to gren's Comments on Zeno's Edits of the POW Section 
 recently commented on my edits in another section . I will address them here.

 if you are going to make large changes on controversial articles it is, as you say, necessary to discuss them and come to a concensus.  No such thing happened with Zeno's edits and for lack of time I reverted to the less horrible version.""""  

, it's not true that I have not discussed my edits. Nor have I made a large change to the article - I have concentrating on one sub-section of the article, and I have concentrated on a small number of facts regarding the treatment of POWs: i.e. the facts that they may be executed, enslaved for labor or sex, ransomed, or freed. These four options in Islamic law concerning POWs are well-known amongst academics and scholars, as my sources have proven. So my edits have not been making any large structural changes to the article, I have concentrated on one sub-section and have elaborated on these four facts. And, as I said, I did discuss these edits, contrary to your allegation. I had been discussing the POW section for several days before I made my recent edit. On July 19, you made this allegation that I have not discussed my edits to the POW section. The truth is that I started discussing the POW section 10 days ago, on July 10, when I started the section Talk:Jihad#Heraclius.27_Mass_Reversion_War. The issue was subsequently discussed in three lengthy sections of this discussion page, before you made this allegation. I had been discussing the POW section here for 10 days, and yet you said that I did not discuss it at all. This is therefore a false allegation on your part. Please follow the discussion page more closely if you are going to talk about who has been discussing what and since when.

 Once you are at wikiepdia for long enough you tool will probably get sick of the same type of narrow-sighted edits that continually happen by new users.  

I'm not sure who or what you are talking about. If you believe that my edit on the POW section was narrow-sighted, then please explain why - enlighten us with your apparently wide-sighted perspective.
 
 """"Maybe this is just me but it seems that ahistorical apologetics are much less dangerous than wholescale demonization and editting articles to say """"Islam says X thing that modern western society doesn't accept. Clearly, neither are very good ways to write an article but the latter has more of an agenda and is usually from the type that end up calling Zora or dab or I Muslims.""""  

Again, I am not sure who or what you are talking about. I certainly have not denounced anyone's views just because they are Muslims. On the contrary, I have said before that I wish there were more Muslims editing this article so that a wider Muslim view could represented than the one that is currently represented by the """"ahistorical apologetics"""" as you call them. 

Having said that, I strongly disagree with your opinion that no one on Wikipedia should describe any Islamic practices or laws that modern society Western does not accept. We must inevitably discuss what """"Islam says"""" about various subjects. We must report the objective facts about traditional Islamic beliefs, in a neutral fashion. Neutrality does not mean that if some traditional belief disagrees with the values of modern Western society then it must be not be mentioned. You seem to be advocating ahistorical apologetics over neutral and objective facts. You have not disproven any of my claims about POWs and Islam, but you have insisted that these objective facts are somehow """"dangerous."""" As for your allegations of """"wholesale demonization,"""" they are unwarrented. The way that Islam treats prisoners of war is completely in line with the norms of the medieval era, during which these practicies were codified. It is a fact of life that Islamic beliefs are deeply rooted in the past, and as a result they are sometimes in disagreement with modern, secular humanist values. If you were truly neutral about this subject, then you would not object to the reporting of facts just because the demonstrate a disagreement between traditional Islam and modern, secular humanist values.  It would be the pinnacle of POV pushing if the article were nothing more than ahistorical appolgetics that ommit any and all facts which demonstrate that traditional Islam is at odds with modern secular humanism. Wikipedia is not the appropriate place for appologetics.

all but the glyph section could be truncated with, as far as I can see, equal justification in the way that you suggest -MY GOD, HE'S SEEN THE LIGHT.

Bodin (1081 – 1101), king of medieval Croatian Duklja, ushered in a new political era in Serbia.

It has a big natural resource in fish due to be a continental shelf larger than Greenland size. Estimates of biomass and abundance were produced for
eight commercial species. The total biomass was 245 000 tonnes and Patagonian toothfish
(Dissostichus eleginoides) accounted for half of the value (124 000 tonnes). The fish biomass
was distributed between the shelf and the deep sea. However, this evaluation remains
incomplete.http://www.ccamlr.org/ccamlr_science/Vol-16-2009/01Duhamel-Hautecoeur.pdf

The continental shelf teem with life, because of the sunlight available in shallow waters, in contrast to the biotic desert of the oceans' abyssal plain. The pelagic (water column) environment of the continental shelf constitutes the neritic zone, and the benthic (sea floor) province of the shelf is the sublittoral zone.Pinet 316-17, 418-19.
Most commercial exploitation from the sea, such as metallic-ore, non-metallic ore, and hydrocarbon extraction, takes place on the continental shelf. Sovereign rights over their continental shelves up to a depth of 200 metres or to a distance where the depth of waters admitted of resource exploitation were claimed by the marine nations that signed the Convention on the Continental Shelf drawn up by the UN's International Law Commission in 1958. This was partly superseded by the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/8_1_1958_continental_shelf.pdf which created the 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone and extended continental shelf rights for states with physical continental shelves that extend beyond that distance.

France extend its jurisdiction over 567 732 square kilometers of the neighboring continental shelf from the land area of 7 215 resulting in 574 947 square kilometers. There are besides some fishing boats and vessels, owned by fishermen on Réunion Island, a department of France approximately 3,300 km (2,100 miles) to the north, who are licensed to fish within the archipelago's Exclusive Economic Zone.

Govern of France principal activities on the Kerguelen Islands focus mostly on scientific research, earth sciences and biology. 
The so-called Kerguelen microcontinent or Kerguelen Plateau include charcoal and conglomerate fragments of gneiss indicate that much of the plateau was above sea level an covered by dense conifer forest.  Tt sanks 20 million years ago and is now  below sea level. It has sedimentary rocks similar to the ones found in Australia and India, suggesting it was gondwanan origen.

The former sounding rocket range to the east of Port-aux-Français  is currently the site of a SuperDARN radar.

Since 1992, the French Centre National d'Études Spatiales (CNES) has operated a satellite and rocket tracking station which is located four kilometers east of Port-aux-Français. There was a need for a tracking station in the Southern Hemisphere, and the French government required that it be located on French territory, rather than in a populated, foreign place like Australia or New Zealand.""""

In violation of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty with soviet Russia, Turkish troops crossed the border in 1918 and attacked Alexandropol (Leninakan). The aggressor intended to crush Eastern Armenia and seize Transccaucasia. When Alexandropol fell, the Turkish Army poured into the Ararat Valley – the heart of Armenia. There was a major engagement at Sardarabad on May 22-26, where the Turkish Army was defeated and retreated.  

First of all I do not know how to revert. I just make changes. Second as I am trying to put this version, a very good guy, named roob323 reverts to an older Turkish version of the site. Moreover, now it sounds even ridiculous.The same thing they wrote twice. Just by cutting and pasting from the history of the article. These kids who never went to school in Armenia, whose knowledge about Armenian history comes from church sunday schools write things that can couse laugh even in Turkish readers. For example, in early May recently becamed independent Armenia was attacked by Ottoman forces ( Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan decalred their independence only in the end of May). Or, after losing the battle of Sardarapat, Armenia declared its independence (second time as a matter of fact). But we all know that the second time Armenia declared its Sovetization (occupation by bolsheviks) on November 29,1920 and not independence. It is very well known that the commander in the battle of Sardarapat was Daniel Bek Pirumov from the village of Nakhichevanik in Nagorno Karabakh. SO fat these 2 imbeciles named Nareklm and roob keep pushing the name Slkuni or Silician.  And finall,y who needs the aftermath of the battle in Sardarapat if it concludes information about what Georgia did, who it asked for help etc etc etc. I am surprized to find out from the article edited by roob and narek that Turkish army occupied the whole Armenia(including Russian part which is todays Armenia). Probably Nagorno Karabakh or Zangezur or Sevan they do not consider a part of Armenia anymore. Moreover, in the history of this article also edited by some turks and Narek you can find out that Armenia was forced to sign treaty of Batumi!!!!!You can see how come 3 not literate (angraget in Armenian) imbeciles can come and do things in wikipedia that Turkish and Azeri propagandists could not even see in their dreams.

Why the Prophet Jeremiah should not be censored out of this article 

All the abusive invective in the world doesn't alter the fact that when we consider the Jewish law, the following is relevant:
  
'How can you say, """"We are wise and the law of the LORD is with us when, in fact, the false pen of the scribes has made it into a lie.'      
Jeremiah 8:8, New Revised Standard Version 

It is relevant because:

 Jeremiah is a major Jewish prophet, so his opinion carries weight.
 Jeremiah lived over 2000 years closer to the time when the books of Moses were compiled.

The fact that another contributor is so determined to remove this evidence from the public record demonstrates that the point Jeremiah makes is sensitive. Nevertheless it is also highly relevant to any rational discussion about this aspect of the Jewish law, and for that reason should remain.

If other contributors wish to argue that Jeremiah's comment about scribal ethics is not relevant to Biblical passages about circumcision, they are welcome to demonstrate this. However, censorship is not the way to make this point.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Well, I'm pretty sure that my Beatle article editing days are over (too much drama and not enough payback), but I'll stick around for a while longer at a few other topics—I've been wanting to write a book in RL and I'll never do that if I spend my free time here. What bugs me the most about all this is that I really think that Dan is doing this purposefully, with the intent to sabotage articles about music he disdains; I.e., I can't find any examples of him doing this at hip-hop, R&B;, or jazz articles. He only makes this problem at articles about classic rock and metal. You might be right though, that in a couple of days Dan will probably grow bored of obstructing Pepper and move on to another victim, so maybe we can take Pepper higher at that point.

 Metasemiotics 

As a journal editor myself, I often hear complaints from authors whose articles were rejected that """"the reviewer did not understand what we were writing"""". The answer is simple: this usually means that the article was not written intelligibly. I have nothing against metasemiotics, but an article that cannot be understood by the average reader will not be of much use to Wikipedia. Honestly, I could make head nor tail of that article. Material published in my own journal could not be placed in Wikipedia without heavy editing either. So my proposal for speedy deletion of your article is no reflection on the quality of the academic journals that you listed. It's just a reflection of the fact that you did not succeed in conveying what metasemiotics is about in generally understandable words. Apparently I was not the only one feeling this way, as the article was deleted by an admin who apparently agreed with me (I am not an admin and therefore cannot delete articles myself). In any case, it was only a speedy delete, so nothing prevents you from trying again. Please keep in mind in that case the public or which you are writing. Happy editing!   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Update: The Oreskes abstracts

 

Naomi Oreskes claims to have analysed 928 abstracts she found listed on the ISI Web of Knowledge database (1993 – 2003) using the keywords """"global climate change."""" However, this claim is incorrect: while the ISI database includes a total of 929 documents for the period in question, it lists only 905 abstracts. It is thus impossible that Oreskes analysed 928 abstracts.

 

In my original critique, I used the same ISI database and the same key words as Oreskes but used all documents listed therein. While Oreskes did not specify the method she applied in her study, she later confirmed that she had limited her search to “articles”, while I included “all document types” in my initial assessment. This difference appears to explain the discrepancy between the “928” abstracts Oreskes claims to have analysed and the 1117 documents I found and considered, although her figures don’t add up, one way or another.

 

Some commentators have argued that these differences undermine my main criticism while they validate Oreskes' claim. However, as I have stressed repeatedly, Oreskes entire argument is flawed as the whole ISI data set includes just 13 abstracts (less than 2%) that explicitly endorse what she has called the 'consensus view.'

 

In fact, the vast majority of abstracts do not mention anthropogenic climate change.

 

I have posted all documents and abstracts listed in the ISI database under the key words “global climate change” (for the period 1993 – 2003) below, arranged by year. Check for yourself! Make sure you differentiate between implicit and explicit endorsement of the IPCC consensus (“[M]ost of the observed warming over the last 50 years is likely to have been due to the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations."""")

The Bridge on the Drina by Ivo Andric, Univeristy of Chicago Press 1977

Translator's foreword by Lovett F. Edwards, page 7: Dr Ivo Andric is himself a Serb and a Bosnian

Introduction by William H. McNeil, page 3:They went to live with her parents in Visegrad on the banks of the Drina, where young Ivo grew up in an artisan family (his grandfather was a carpenter) playing on the bridge he was later to make so famous, ..., The family was Orthodox Christian, i.e. Serb;

and in the

The Nobel Prize in Literature 1961 Presentation Speech by Anders Österling, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy - As a young Serbian student, he joined the national revolutionary movement, suffered persecution, and was imprisoned in 1914 when the war broke out. 

which shall have place in his biography for knowing that the book translator Edwards and the world-renown historian McNeil were close Ivo's friends. Both biographical notes were written in the first edition of this Ivo's book in 1959 and the biographical data are coming from the very Ivo.

Anders Österling's Presentation Speech during the official ceremony 1961 in Sweden and in the Andric's presence - gives the undeniable credibility to biographical data heard in this speech. - 

As to the Clasification paragraph - it has nothing to do with biography - just a slander and disrespect of this great writer. My proposal - delete it completely. 

From the above discussion - is visible that Andric rejected idea to be seen as of Croatian lineage

When Krleza attempted to allign Ivo with Croats - Ivo responded this way

 Enes Cengic; """"Krleza post mortem"""",  I-III. Svjetlost, Sarajevo, 1990. 2. part, pages 171-172

 """" Medjutim, s tekstom o Andricu za staru Enciklopediju stvari su tekle ovako:
 Tekst je napisao Milan Bogdanovic i poslao ga meni na imprimatur, kao biva, da li ga primam  ili ne.
 Kao ni mnoge druge tekstove,  vjerovali vi sad meni ili ne ... ja tekst o Andricu nisam citao. 
 Mislio sam: Neka pise sto hoce, tako cemo to i objaviti. Ionako  je bilo iznad moje moci da tu ista 
 diram i ispravljam. Mjesec ili ne znam koliko nakon sto mi je poslao tekst, primim od Milana pismo 
 u kojem mi kaze da je kopiju teksta dao Ivi Andricu na uvid te da on moli da budem ljubazan i da u 
 tekstu nesto izmijenim, a to je:

 Ivo Andric, rodjen u Travniku 10.10.1892. godine, hrvatskog porijekla, zavrsio skole itd.... Moli 
 me da brisem da je hrvatskog porijekla. Na to odgovaram Bogdanovicu (oprostite sto citiram):
     
 Dragi moj Milane,

 Pozdravi Ivu Andrica u moje ime, veoma srdacno,i poruci mu, ako mozes, da mu ja jebem hrvatsku
 majku, brisat cu da je hrvatskog  porijekla."""" 

Shortly, Milan Bogdanovic wrote a text of Andric's biography, presented a copy of this text to Andric. Andric asked Bogdanovic to remove the note saying that he (Ivo) was a man of Croatian lineage.

You had a hunch that smth changed. Thats it. And you allow yourself to change this article. NOT WRITE IT, CHANGE IT. So there are 2 editors who said they are playable, and you as 1 person are still right.
In a mean time, before i managed to reply you, smbdy else already changed hawkeye and spideman back. So, now there are 3 of us. Will you change it again?

Furthermore, you asked me to give you a proof, and i posted an ss. Now you are questioning validity of that, and my candour with it. Then why you bothered to ask me in a first place?! Because you are bored? Im not. Really am not.

Is hulk a bot in this picture?! Really?! Have you even played the game? And when you 'did' play, how many times your champ was on the right side in the battle?? Try to think before coming after someones integrity. Or just try to think. Anyplace. Anytime.

No, that is not my spiderman. Like a reasonable, logical being, after i seen that someone changed this article here, i asked my ally if they have one of the champs, and if they could try to play 1v1 with them. Only few people didnt sell those 1*s in my ally, but luckily one of them few had 2 of those and he sent me ss, which i posted here.
But being an awesome mate and even better human being, even i asked for only one ss, he sent me few of them ss1  ss2 ss3  ss4, apologized for late wolverine ss, and asked if i needed it better. I said no, cause i thought im dealing with a normal person. Honest mistake.

Ive done my elaborations. With even one ss, your whole theory falls, i really dont have to prove the others. That Thor i never seen, never heard about him, so i think its normal i never mentioned it, nor have i ever changed anything about him. Do try to contact kabam about that as well.

Now, im done writing to you. If you gonna ask for another ss, to prove every champ you think doesnt exist, exists, then you know where you can go.
I think ive proven more than i need, especially since i had to prove innocence in a first place. Meanwhile, ill keep changing it until i get blocked. Then im done with editing ever, ill die of heart attack before 40.

Herbeck/von Herbeck
Hi, James,  Well, I think there are three separate questions:
 The two articles I merged were most definitely about the same person, unless 2 people with virtually the same name, the same nationality, working in the same field, shared exactly the same day of birth and exactly the same day of death.  Technically possible, but extraordinarily unlikely, I would suggest.  
  Now, there may indeed have been another Johann Herbeck who worked around that time, but I'm no expert and I've never heard of such person.
 As to why the Bruckner biographies have him as Herbeck and not von Herbeck, it's probably because he got his """"von"""" only in 1874, three years before his death.  For the great bulk of his life, he was simply Herr Herbeck, so it's appropriate to refer to him that way in a biog of another person.  For an encyclopedia article, however, he gets his full final name.  

This is a very handy source for some further updates to the article.  Cheers.      """,0,0,0,0,0,0

You're selectively reading portions of the article and ignoring the rest to come to a false conclusion.  It is very clear, both in the specific context of the specific article, and the broader context of his other writing, that Stenger regards the attempt to connect quantum mechanics with consciousness, whether by Lazla, the Maharishi and the TM Movement, including Hagelin, Capra, or others as all of a piece, whether one calls it """"quantum consciousness"""", """"cosmic consciousness"""", or Stenger's preferred term """"quantum metaphysics"""", or the term used in Wikipedia """"quantum mysticism"""", and his criticism is not limited to Lanza. The argument that the Stenger reference doesn't meet WP:V is nothing but Wikilawyering. Verifiability does not mean that a reliable source needs to provide footnotes or references for statements made by the author.  You are confusing what is required of Wikipedia editors in citing reliable, verifiable sources with what is required of the authors of those sources. That is not what verifiability means.  The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia is verifiability, not truth—that is, whether readers are able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether we think it is true. Editors should provide a reliable source for quotations and for any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or the material may be removed.

f947a0abb020fcd5,"""Apparently transphobic can be used as stigmatization label even for people who just disagree with postmodernist perceptions of gender, indeed, those who lean more for biological determinism of the sexes. Transphobia seems pretty vague, varying from pure hatred towards transgender people from just preferring to use Bradley in this article. What you suggest, some form of moral policing I suppose, is utterly wrong. Who would determine what reliable sources are reporting in a way seemingly transphobic? Also, I believe there is a previous administrative action case of Wikipedians describing fellow editors asIslamophobic, because it's very close to a personal attack (especially as some people felt it concerns commenting another editor's mental state, an accusation of a medical phobia). In any case, it's not very good for the community that people are calling other editors -phobic or the other way """"politically correct liberals"""". I'm sure disagreements can be solved without resorting to such self-righteous means. -'

I did not make a single edit to Wikipedia from March 5 to May 1. It will be a great loss to Wikipedia content (vs the wiki-police force and policies) if editors like myself leave because members such as Padenton are allowed to group attack people without bothering to properly look into the facts.

Hi, """"see also"""" sections should not contain links to articles that are already linked to in the main body of an article (see WP:MOS). The whole section should therefore be removed from Democracy & Nature. Also, it's fine to list editorial board members, if there are independent sources that document what these people did for the journal. Most editorial board members don't ever do anything for a journal, so unless there are sources, we don't list them, no matter how notable they are. The same goes for contributors. If you want to tell readers that John Doe contributed to a journal, you will need an independent source that confirms that this was a notable contribution. It is not enough that John Doe himself is notable. Please see our journal article writing guide and WP:NOTINHERITED. In addition, WP does not allow original research and/or synthesis.

It might be wise to let old school hip hop redirect to old school hip hop music for a while, however, as many other articles link here. When a section about old school hip hop appears in hip hop culture, we could redirect old school hip hop there instead, until that section grows big enough to justify its own article about general old school hip hop, like you said.

 my editor review 

Hi István,

Thanks so much for your thoughtful input to my editor review! Firstly, to answer the question you asked: I'm not sure yet if I really want to be an admin. Like I said, I've been toying with the idea, but I keep having these nagging doubts that it wouldn't be right for meI'd get carried away with my newfound powers, or I'd feel pressured by the responsibility that goes along with those powers, or I wouldn't have the time to be an effective admin anyway, or I'd spend so much of my wikitime admin-ing that I'd lose sight of actually writing and editing. So as I think of it now, mulling it over, I suppose I'm leaning against it. There is a certain """"prestige"""" awarded those who are elected admins and that certainly had an attraction for methe satisfaction of earning the respect from my fellow editors, being entrusted with the special toolsbut that's no reason to seek adminship. Yeah...you and the nagging little voice in my head are probably right, adminship isn't my thing.

Regarding your criticisms: I know I'm naive, not to mention emotional to a fault. (as you know all too well!) There are a lot of things that should just slide right off my back but for whatever quirk in my personality, they don't. I've always been like this and probably always will beheightened emotional sensitivity is hardly a detriment to me as a musician/artist, but it definitely can get in the way sometimes in places like this. I'm learning to deal with it better, I think, just by getting more experience, but it's probably always going to be an issue for me to some extent. And to be completely fair to myself, I'm actually quite stable at the """"core of my being"""" (to use a cheesy phrase) and there's very little in everyday life that can really hurt me deeply. (i.e. stuff waaaay more serious than dumb arguments on the wiki.) I haven't totally lost perspective! ;-) 

Your comments about my tendency to try desperately to find common ground with unreasonable editors were also spot-on; I certainly have done that but didn't quite consciously realize it until you pointed it out!! I hate the types who always go around making enemies and assuming the worst, and I always try to avoid being like that, the obvious result being that I often overcompensate and end up gullible and easily pushed-around: """"I'll say whatever you like, just please don't start a fight!!"""" (I've done that most often with a certain Serbian fellow, for some reasonhoping to score brownie points and maybe win civil treatment eventually?!) Lousy foreign-policy strategy really...I'll try to do a better job of standing my ground in the future.   

I must say though, I'm quite touched by the compliments section of your review: I guess my charming and atmosphere-improving qualities could be considered the good side of my diplomatic naivete? ;-) I'm glad to hear that my efforts are appreciatedespecially glad to hear it from you, since you are without a doubt another of those people who makes the Wiki not suck, and I value your opinion quite highly.

 I have  read various pieces by Dr Mehdi Khaz'ali and listened to various  interviews with him, and must say that he comes over as a fantasist. He  just says things that some people badly want to hear, and that seems to  be the only thing that keeps him afloat in the media. Regarding Mr  Ahmadinejad not having served in the War, it is not true, but from a  technical point of view Mr Khaz'ali's story may contain some element of  truth. The fact is that Mr Ahmadinejad was not fighting as a regular  army soldier or officer, but was working party as a military logistic  engineer and partly as a military intelligence officer from behind  enemy's line. If my memory is not failing, during the War years he spent  some time in Kirkuk,  Iraq, amongst members of the Patriotic  Union of Kurdistan or Kurdistan  Democratic Party of Iraq  - both groups  were fighting alongside Iran against Saddam Hossein. The fact that after  the War he, i.e. Mr Ahmadinejad, became the Deputy to Governor-General of Maku  and Khoy  (West Azarbaijan Province has a sizeable Kurdish  population), and later Advisor to Governor-General of Kurdistan,  have direct relationship to his War-time experience in Iraqi Kurdistan.  Thus, indeed Mr Mohsen Rezai may not have been technically wrong in  saying that Mr Ahmadinejad has not been """"at the front"""" (assuming that  indeed the alleged statement is due to Mr Rezai), but to say that Mr  Ahmadinejad has lied about his War efforts, is just a false and  defamatory statement. Let us assume for a moment that Mr Ahmadinejad has  lied about his War efforts. Is it at all conceivable that a young man  from Tehran would get so early on so high up in the highest  administrative offices of Maku, Khoy and Kurdistan, from all places? As I  said earlier, Mehdi Khaz'ali is just a fantasist who seems to believe  in his own fantasies (there are some videos on YouTube  in which he says things that no one in his position could possibly  know).

 MSM 

Agreed

Every single source I have and Puellanivis has referred to has said that TG/TS women are considered MSM or """"along side"""" MSM. The much vaunted CDC source made it sound even less ambigous. Her very own source backed me! That TG/TS women are for the CDC's and any other medical purpose biologically male, that the MSM category does not take into account any aspec of identity. Which would include gender identity. Case closed.

The rest of this has just been about Puella and her personal feelings.   

No, my source states that gender identity is not tracked at all, so the assumption on their part is that everyone is reported as they """"biological"""" sex.  However, again, if a TS/TG were reported as female, since no gender identity information would be collected there would be no indication of which were which.  Literally TS/TG information is entirely intermingled, in some indeterminable amount.  The ambiguity of not collecting TS/TG information means that there is simply a blanket assumption about how the information is received from the CDC... the true answer is, because of the ambiguity no one knows how they're split up... the data is intermingled, and there is no way to separate the information.  Again, the answer from the CDC and from your sources is that the assumption is that MTF TS/TG are reported as MSM, and FTM are just pretty much ignored... N.B. assumption... since gender identity information isn't collected no one can say what it is.  Again, being that my medical records indicate me as female, and I continue to be asked """"are you pregnant?"""" when getting x-rays indicates that I would not be reported as a male to the CDC.  Without collecting gender identity information, no one can with certainty that all TS/TG are recorded as MSM.  The answer is """"it's inconsistent and no one knows"""", not """"haha I'm right, you're wrong, TS/TG are always MSM"""".   """,0,0,0,0,0,0
5f3457d800022f7c,"Protected Mode and Long Mode 

Protected Mode was first introduced in Intel 80286, providing mechanism protecting resource and assisting multi-task OS such as UNIX, OS/2 and so forth, and enhanced in Intel 80386 processor by extending computing capability to 32 bits from 16 bits, eventually becomes part of IA-32 architecture. Most x86 OS only running within protectected mode such as Windows NT, Linux, and so many BSD distros; but MS-DOS working under real mode, some extender might switch through and back from protected mode for extending physical memory addressing, likewise, Windows 3.x also transit itself from real mode and protected mode thorugh and ack too. Windows 9x not only depends the real mode as bootstrap, but also sits itself from and to that mode. 

Long Mode is a kind of protected mode, not a real mode, but does not belong to the Protected Mode in IA-32, switches itself out of IA-32 dominated Legacy Mode, to a completely self-contained mode, which means even though a x64 processor eliminates its legacy part, it would be fulfunctioned. From the aspect of implementation, or Microarchitecture level, the legacy mode codes could share the same physical execution resources designed for the x64 codes, without needing additional physical execution units for itself, like it found in early Itanium processor. So IA-32 architecture might or might not have relationship with x86-64, x64, AMD64 or Intel64. 

 IA32e and AMD64 

AMD64 is a switched-out architecture from IA-32, providing compatibility mode to support most IA-32 software and representing itself in the Long Mode within AMD64 processors. It is a new architecture, even though most lying on IA-32 architecture. 

IA32e is not a mode, but an extention of IA-32, or newer revision of IA-32, introducing 64-bit computing capability for its fundemental architecture. Intel EM64T is the new brought feature to this kind of processors, enabling it for 64-bit computing. Of course, EM64T is not a mode too, but a feature like PAE, could be enabled to extend the 64-bit computing capability. Without EM64T enabled, Yamhill processor would act like a tradtional Pentium 4. 

After EM64T enabled, 64-bit registers would be visible to applications. 32-bit traditional OS might need minor fixes to support applications referring 64-bit registers to do the 64-bit computings, but programmers must take care of the computing results without intervented by other processes. But most likely as it in PAE, OS might need a patch to support this feature totally, at least to manage the extended descriptors and extended 64-bit registers and stacks and so forth, but without needing to compile the OS from the scratch like it in AMD64. Virtual Address might be extended up to 52 bits, while physical address up to 46 bits. 16K segments of 4GiB could be spreaded to 64TiB physical space, with or without paging. Because the difference between 32bit and 64bit computing is bit width of register rather than the whole system, so 32-bit and 64-bit codes is also differentiated by the referenced resgistered without needing a submode, such as compatibility mode to support tradtional 32-bit software.

 Criticisms of an Innately Modular Mind 

Many of the criticisms of EP have to do with their belief that nature selected a mind characterized by innately pre-specified domain-specific information-processing modules that were adapted to solve specific problems within our Pleistocene past. This section was intended to include criticisms of their 'massively' or even 'mostly-massively' assumptions with regard to modularity. However, the 'rebuttals' seem aimed, not toward defending their position, but toward attacking an entirely domain-general version of the mind. Firstly, this kind of structure does not address the criticisms pertaining to the EP position, and are thus not 'true' rebuttals to these criticisms. Secondly, it creates a false-dichotomy and strawman presentation of the critics, suggesting that the only other 'alternative' to the EP definition of the mind is an entirely domain-general one. 

My suggestion, is to either cut these kinds of rebuttals, or to add a separate section beneath it titled: """"Criticisms of the Domain-General Model of Mind."""" Let us describe EPers fighting their strawmen in a separate section.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Could you please explain why you redirected Military Commission to Military Justice?

Were you unaware that one of the huge controversies over the USA's use of military commissions to try the Guantanamo captives was that they were a new distinct system, separate from its traditional military justice system?  The Military Commission system had no established rules of evidence, no established precedents.  This is why rather than being the speedy system that was promised, these cases have dragged on for almost a decade.  

Legal critics predicted these problems back when Bush tried to create the new Military Commission system.  They pointed out that the USA already had two perfectly adequate justice systems, its civilian justice system and its military justice system.  The military commission system, they pointed out, was a brand new, third justice system.

One of David Hicks's lawyers described, with disgust, why he wasn't available to give Hicks his advice, when Hicks's was presented with a plea bargain deal on the eve of his commission.  Hicks's lawyer who had flown all the way to Guantanamo, from Australia, described being told he could not participate any further in Hicks's defense, unless he signed a draconian document that would have imposed heavy punishment upon him, if he broke any of the commission's rules and procedures.  Fine, he says, please let me read those rules.  He then described his shock and outrage when he was told that he couldn't be given a copy of the commission's rules and procedures because they hadn't been written yet.

And I think the tennis event is much more important than those events and they should change to Dutch Open (golf). But I think it's better to wait until finishing this week's tennis events then discuss about it to prevent more confusions. Thanks again )  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

From the Hood quote it certainly looks as though it's altered enough (and both versions were successful enough) for each to have a separate article - that's one issue. (Although I do wonder about the 1983 Sadler's Wells version. If it had a new book and lyrics, it clearly wasn't Hood and Ross's version - so is it a version of Count, or of Graf? Does anyone know about the music?)

As for the other - I'd say it's definitely an operetta. Unless we can prove some substantial alteration of the music - style, vocal range, whatnot - it's the music from an operetta, and the show is an operetta.

On an unrelated note, doesn't anyone who's already worked on this article know how the plot resolves? """"Things work out okay and there's pretty music"""" isn't quote what one hopes to get out of a synopsis.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

No objection if you write up the children's home: H. M. Brown (he was also an Anglican oriest and the author of several books) says this about the home «He had inaugurated a Home for orphaned children in a one-time public-house, receiving for care and attention children commended to him by the local authority.» (one of the things he mentions about St Hilary in Twenty Years is that it had four public houses) In the next paragraph he says: «His church had been gradually enriched with painted choir stalls, pictures, statues and several altars of stone. Its appearance was neither exactly Roman, nor medieval, but largely sui generis, every ornament and gift the result of love.» (Brown: A Century for Cornwall; p. 98) The children's home is described in chapter 18 of Twenty Years.

The second paragraph presently begins: Study tech attempts to remove what it calls """"barriers to study"""".  Study Tech defines 3 barriers.  As a dictionary defines words and as biology defines the cell """"nucleus"""" and the """"cell membrane"""", well, Study Tech defines 3 barriers which it says exist.

Could we have Study tech defines three barriers to study and purports a methodology of dealing with them? The reason the present sentence is not accurate is because no matter how many times a student removes a barrier, he may meet the same barrier in the next word he reads.

 Your links at Fatal Frame 

I saw your request for help at Help talk:Page history and came here to see what the problem was.

The Wikipedia rules on external links are much stricter than many editors realise. In particular, most links to blog sites are not allowed. The automated program  has been taught to check all edits made by new users which add links. One of its rules is that if the site name contains the word """"blogspot"""" then the edit should be rejected. 99% of the time this works well, helping new users to learn the rules.
Once you had been warned by XLinkbot, it was not helpful for you to continue trying to add the link. This can eventually be seen as disruptive; hence the warning that included the word """"vandalism"""". The term is used at Wikipedia to include various types of disruptive behaviour, as described here.

 Characteristic Saffir-Simpson Cat 4 Cyclone Larry Central pressure 920-944 mbar 915! mbar when landfall made Potential damages """"More extensive curtainwall failures with some complete roof structure failure on small residences. Major erosion of beach areas. Terrain may be flooded well inland."""" 55% of all buildings in Innisfail damaged. Entire banana crop and some of sugarcane crop demolished. Rooves stripped of countless buildings; some buildings flattened entirely. Extensive flooding. Universal power outages, sewage system fails. Airports closed for the day. Storm surge4.0–5.5 m5.0m 1-minute average sustained winds210-245 kph 200km/h confirmed. Otherwise unknown, with gusts frequently exceeding 280kph. Conclusion Larry is indeed a category 4 cyclone at the very least, unless we are willing to ignore important factors for the sake of 10km/h of confirmed sustained wind.

I already have an article (American) claiming it was Cat 4. It's right [here. However, as you stated earlier, newsgroups are not an authority on the matter, are they? As for my friend , well what can I say to you? You have gone against all sound logic and called me a liar because I can't confirm 10km/h of sustained wind. I'm unsure if you even know what logic is. To you, it's all cold hard data, with stupidty thrown in for free. Your level of intelligence sickens me. You've also failed to note the case for central pressure, which was on par with most Cat 5 storms. What you're proposing is this: 

""""A cyclone that brought about more than the effects and damages of a typical Category 4 storm and that had the Central Pressure of a typical Category 5 storm, is in fact a mere Category 3, simply because it's confirmed/measured sustained winds were 5 knots below the """"cut-off"""" for Category 4.""""

For the rest of you: SS scale uses 1-minute averages. A 1-minute average of 200km/h was RECORDED about 30km north of where the cyclone crossed. I understand this is 10km/h less than the cut off for cat 4 (as stated above), but at least it puts estimates and what-nt to rest. Further, I'll leave the rest of my argument to logic, that is, if you have any.

027ddece1b86f804,"""{{Unblock|I'll make a renewed effort not to give personal attacks. But of course I do have some questions about this unwarranted blockage, as you might well imagine:

1. Why is it that IP editors tend to get the raw ends of the deal: that you """"admins"""" tend to lean towards the side of someone who's editing with an account over someone who's editing without one, especially in the area of what you label as """"personal attacks"""" or """"harassment"""" when given by the IP-editor but not so much when the named editor does the same thing?

2. For exampleand this is... yep, maybe you guessed it... question 2: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" (according to you) for someone with a name... like, say... escape orbit... to dish out a personal attack, but not for me to give him one back because I'm just a lowly IP-editor? Specifically, why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him to give me a personal attack by putting false stuff on my keyboard by making the ludicrous claim that my reason for wanting the old style of """"ebaY"""" logo to go next to the current one, """"ebay,"""" in the lead, is """"because I wanted it in there,"""" even though that is a total lie; but it's supposedly """"not okay"""" for me to call that kind of slander stupid?

3. Here's another one: Why is it supposedly """"okay"""" for him and """"smiley girl"""" there to falsely accuse my edits of being """"vandalism"""" just because they differed from what these guys preferred, but then when I say their reversions are vandalism, I get in trouble for it as if it were a """"personal attack"""" just because I'm an IP-only editor?

4. Ready for one more? Then why is it fine for any of you named editors to give one of us IP-editors a warning template, but when I, as an IPer do the same thing to a named editor like I did to partially smiley girl, I get dinged with """"Oh, you can't do that 'cause that's a 'personal attack',"""" or """"Oh, that's bad because that's 'harassment' """"?

5. Oh yeah, here's one more! Remember the rule about edit-warring (just in general, meaning that it doesn't even have to be breaking 3RR) that says that """" 'but I was right, so I was not edit-warring' is no defense""""? Well then doesn't that apply to meeting some so-called """"consensus"""" too (since some things aren't cases of concrete correctness but are just based more on whether they match what that so-called """"consensus"""" wanted the thing to say)? Well then why is it that just because your named friend smiley there does some edit-warring against me to put the thing back to what your exclusive (partial) """"consensus"""" wants it to say, AND since my editing had already been established as NOT vandalism even though it disagrees, you ignore that above-mentioned edit-warring rule and give her/him a pass anyway, but when I, an IP-only editor who's against your exclusive """"consensus,"""" do the same thing, it's """"edit-warring"""" even though it was the same thing as what smiley's doing (remember the """"being-right/matching-consensus-is-no-defense"""" rule)?

 The Gamergate Conspiracy 

We have discussed at some length above whether Gamergate should be described as a """"controversy,"""" as we do now, or as a """"movement”, as Gamergate supporters apparently prefer.  The sources clearly have a hard time finding the precise language to use here. So do we. Let’s look at all the options.

A movement is “a group of people working together to advance their shared political, social, or artistic ideas.” The members, or the leaders, of a movement are identifiable people, and the shared ideas are typically put forth in a manifesto or platform. Examples include the labor movement, the temperance movement, the Impressionist movement, and the Chautauqua movement. Even the resistance movements of the Second World War were characterized by organization; indeed, organization is what distinguishes an “organized resistance,”  and a resistance necessarily adheres to stated principles.  Gamergate lacks leadership, organization, or a statement of principles. Gamergate is not a movement; nomovement come to mind that lacks either leadership and manifesto.

A controversy is “a dispute, a prolonged public disagreement.” Controversy surrounds Gamergate; indeed, that controversy has made Gamergate notable. Some have argued here at some length that, while controversy surrounds Gamergate, Gamergate is not a controversy. They do have a point: our sources do write of “Gamergate supporters,” but no one writes about “Watergate supporters” or “Tea Pot Dome supporters.”    Our current lede uses “controversy” as a generous fiction: it's not perfect, but it’s been satisfactory for some time and I have no strong objection to maintaining it.

We do have a word that does apply rigorously to Gamergate as it is described by the sources: that word is conspiracy A conspiracy is “a secret plan by a group to do something unlawful or harmful,” and this is precisely what our sources describe.  Gamergate’s absence of visible leadership and the lack of expressed principles aren’t compatible with the behaviors of movements but are, of course, quite common in conspiracies from Alcibiades to Cataline and onward.

“Plot” might be an alternative to “conspiracy,” though it is probably even more pejorative. “Scheme” would also work in its American usage, but its use in British English to describe a governmental or institutional programme would cause confusion.  “Crusade” captures the fervor of Gamergate’s supporters and the violence of their sentiments, but crusades have a stated goal. Likewise, Gamergate cannot be a “campaign” or a “drive” as it lacks an objective toward which to it steer. “Cabal” is possible, I suppose.

But “conspiracy” is precise. “Conspiracy” also lets us finesse the problem of Gamergate being said to “claim” to be a movement. Who can credibly assert that claim? Someone might claim that Gamergate is a clam, or a festival, or a joke: how should we judge? If someone claims it’s one thing, and someone else claims it’s not, how do we distinguish?  In two ways: WP:RS and WP:FRINGE.  Following the latter, it’s hard to see that Gamergate can be made to fit the definition of “movement,” but it clearly fits the definition of “conspiracy” perfectly.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Under Genetic explanations, WRN has written this - 

To support these claims, they often cite several lines of evidence that they interpret as support for a partly genetic cause of group differences in IQ:   1. Black–White–East Asian differences in IQ, reaction time, and brain size are observed worldwide in a range of cultures and environments. In the United States, significant Black-White IQ differences are observable at every age above 3 years, within every occupation or socioeconomic level tested, in every region of the country, and at every time since the invention of ability tests.[106]   2. Jensen and other have argued that the magnitude of race differences on different IQ subtests correlate with the extent to which those subtests measures g,[107] which also correlates with measures of the subtests heritability.[108] From these and other findings, they argue that race differences have a partly biological basis.[109]   3. The rising heritability of IQ with age (within all races; studies have found on average in the developed world heritability starts at 20% in infants, rises to 40% in middle childhood, and peaks at 80% in adulthood); and studies showing the virtual disappearance (~0.0) by adulthood of shared environmental effects on IQ (for example, family income, education, and home environment), with adopted siblings partaking in the studies no more similar in IQ than with strangers[110] From these studies, they argue that most suggested environmental explanations for IQ difference between groups do not have a strong enough effect on IQ to fully account for group differences.
4. Studies of US comparisons of both parents to children and siblings to each other finding regression to differing means for different races (85 for Blacks and 100 for Whites) across the entire range of IQs,[111] despite the fact that siblings are matched for shared environment and genetic heritage, with regression unaffected by family socioeconomic status and generation examined[112]

This seems to be excessive detail.  WRN has essentially recreated Rushton/Jensen arguments, and placed citations in his citation.  This essentially allows WRN to write an entire section, as if it were incontrovertible based on various references, without any possible response.  The NPOV fact that should be reported is that Rushton and Jensen make some assertions, not that they make some assertions, and here is the factual evidence they use to back it up.  If anything, every one of their """"lines of evidence"""" should be attributed directly to Rushton and Jensen, as much of that same evidence may be interpreted as undermining the """"genetic hypothesis"""", depending on the viewer.  It seems very weaselly, in any case. 

Can we agree these four points should be removed from the article?  Comments?

OK, I'll list here what you flagged. Some are not mine. I'll comment later and see if others have individual opinion first.   
Since then similar efforts have been organized for other 2008 presidential candidates.[citation needed]
Sample comment: This seems to be a fine summary statement, reliably sourced in the article such as by UPI. We can just copy the footnote refs to it.   
The popular usage of """"moneybomb"""" to describe a coordinated mass donation drive for a political candidate can be traced to a weekly donation drive, the Ron Paul Money Bomb, which aimed to raise $1 million each week for Ron Paul's presidential campaign.[2][citation needed] (Daily Paul)
Jesse Elder, a New York City jazz pianist,[3][4] registered the new identity """"RonPaulMoneyBomb"""" at YouTube;[5][citation needed] (New York Times, All About Jazz, YouTube)
Eric Nordstrom then registered the identical .com domain.[6][citation needed] (Network Solutions)
Supporters of Mike Huckabee organized a moneybomb on November 20 to commemorate International Children's Day, which raised nearly $225,000, well over the pledged amount, bringing Huckabee's monthly total to $1 million as of November 20th.[11][citation needed] (Nov20ForTheChildren)
Supporters of Dennis Kucinich's presidential campaign are also using the term """"moneybomb"""" to describe their own major fundraising drive aimed for December 15, 2007, the anniversary of the Bill of Rights coming into effect.[12][citation needed] (News and Policy)
Proposed on November 6 on Daily Kos, the drive has an ultimate goal for 100,000 pledges of $100.[13][citation needed] (December152007)
Kucinich supporters are using viral advertising techniques to promote the drive by putting up YouTube videos and circulating them throughout the web.[citation needed]
Along with generating a significant amount of donations for a political candidate, a moneybomb can also generate significant media interest in a largely unknown candidate.[citation needed]
In addition to the media coverage, the November 5 drive was able to get 21,000 new donors to the campaign, over half of the donors on that day.[18][citation needed] (AP)
While there is no definitive link, after November 5, Ron Paul saw a measurable rise in the polls, showing the potential ability for a moneybomb to improve a candidate's place in a political campaign.[20][21][citation needed] (TransWorldNews, NBC4)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Confusion
I was looking through this article and some links it points to, and noticed the following oddity:
On this page, EM radiation is distinguished from particle radiation, while it is claimed that particle radiation is made of moving subatomic particles.  Thing is, a photon is such a particle.  In fact, if you follow the link to the article about particle radiation, you'll notice that a photon is, in fact, on the list of particles there!  Therefore, it would appear that EM radiation is, in fact, a sort of particle radiation.
Being no expert on physics myself, I can only assume that it was meant that particle radiation is made of particles other than photons, i.e. ones that don't display particle/wave duality.  If so, I'd say that should be expressed more clearly.  Either way, either this page, or the one on particle radiation, should definitely be changed somehow to deal with this confusion.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 89.138.227.172  00:46, August 30, 2007 (UTC)

================================
These are prior comments from earlier this year (2011) that were ignored:

1. Wikipedia Elective surgery states: """"Elective surgery is surgery that is scheduled in advance because it does not involve a medical emergency. Semi-elective surgery is a surgery that must be done to preserve the patient's life, but does not need to be performed immediately.""""

2. Medicinenet.com defines the term Elective surgery as follows: """"Surgery that is subject to choice (election)...As opposed to urgent or emergency surgery."""" []

3. Medicinenet.com defines the term Elective as follows: """"In medicine, something chosen (elected). An elective procedure is one that is chosen (elected) by the patient or physician that is advantageous to the patient but is not urgent. Elective surgery is decided by the patient or their doctor. The procedure is seen as beneficial but not absolutely essential at that time."""" []

4. Wikipedia Surgery states: """"Types of surgery: Surgical procedures are the commonly categorized by urgency, type of procedure, body system involved, degree of invasiveness, and special instrumentation. Based on timing: Elective surgery is done to correct a non-life-threatening condition, and is carried out at the patient's request, subject to the surgeon's and the surgical facility's availability. Emergency surgery is surgery which must be done promptly to save life, limb, or functional capacity. A semi-elective surgery is one that must be done to avoid permanent disability or death, but can be postponed for a short time. Based on purpose: Exploratory surgery is performed to aid or confirm a diagnosis. Therapeutic surgery treats a previously diagnosed condition.""""

Thus a reasonable person would conclude that non-emergency therapeutic surgery is a subcategory of elective surgery. Nearly all surgical abortions are NOT emergency procedures (in other words, they are scheduled procedures and are not medical emergencies).      

It seems that this Abortion article's inartful use of the terms """"elective"""" and """"therapeutic"""" confuses the reader rather than clarifying important distinctions. One would use """"elective"""" to describe a procedure based on the timing of the surgery. One would use the term """"therapeutic"""" to describe a procedure based on whether there has been a diagnosis.  The 2 terms are not mutually exclusive.  

If the terms """"elective"""" and """"therapeutic"""" are to be applied consistently (with no politically correct definitions for procedures performed on pregnant women), then virtually all therapeutic abortions are also elective procedures. Practically speaking, in nearly all modern situataions the 2 terms will be mutually inclusive because modern medicine considers the satisfaction of any woman's desire to no longer be pregnant (regardless of the reason why she no longer wants to be pregnant) as """"therapeutic"""", and abortion is virtually NEVER performed under emergency conditions (in other words: there are virtually no occurences in which an abortion must be done immediately to avoid a serious health risk).   

The current section of this article called """"Induced"""" [] contains a false dichotomy when it states: """"Reasons for procuring induced abortions are typically characterized as either therapeutic or elective. An abortion is medically referred to as a therapeutic abortion when it is performed to: ... An abortion is referred to as elective when it is performed at the request of the woman """"for reasons other than maternal health or fetal disease."""". 

This false dichotomy should be corrected by helping the reader understand that the 2 terms therapeutic and elective are virtually synonymous, rather than leading the reader to incorrectly think that an abortion is EITHER elective OR therapeutic. Rarely will any therapeutic abortion not also be elective.  

Finally, using the term """"therapeutic"""" also implies that the condition of being pregnant is a disease or a health defect, when in reality, absent any political use of medical terminology, pregnancy is a sign of a healthy reproductive system and is never a disease. There are extremely rare occassions when organs of or near the reproductive tract are diseased and an abortion could thus be therepeutic to the gravid woman (though fatal to the fetus). 

Perhaps this wording would address these concerns:

 Agree. Dr. Karl Skorecki have the final word about Cohanim genetic signatures. He, more than anyone else, is the most credible person that can publish articles and true informations about Cohanim genetic signatures, not Jheald. He was the one who discovered the CMH in 1997. After 10 years, he came out to announce in 2007, that """"he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2"""". Katz, Kaplan, Rappaport, Shapiro, Kovacs,Konh, are all J2. Those surnames and families are the most prestigious Cohanim families today. They are all Cohanim J2. J2 Cohanim is much more common than J1 Cohanim. """"Skorecki reported that Pinchas the zealot mentioned in the Bible may be the origin of J2"""" This is a very important information that confirms matematical, historic, and genealogy facts. Phinchas was the son of Eleazar. Itamar was his brother. Out of the 24 Cohanim houses, 16 did belong to Eleazar-Pinchas, while only 8 came out from Itamar seed. Eleazar-Pinchas (J2) had a much larger population than Itamar. All Cohanim genealogy were divided into those two houses, until the destruction of the second temple. So, if Phinchas is the origin of all Cohanim J2, than it makes sense, since his Cohanim seed produced much more descendants than his brother Itamar. So, it is very normal and logical to understand why genetic cohanim signatures presents two CMHs wich is the caracteristics of the two houses of Cohanim. All genealogic tree for Cohanim since Aaron until today are still divided into these two houses: Eleazar-Pinchas and Itamar. During the 1270 years of the cohanim services (Mishkan and Mikdash) the Cohanim jews were always selected by the 24 houses. 18 from Pinchas, and only 8 from Itamar.

78.101.90.200  

Agree. Dr. Karl Skorecki of the Ramban/Technion Medical Center in Haifa, who is renowned for his discovery in 1997 of the Kohen genetic signature, reported in 2007 that he and his research team have discovered not one but two Cohen Modal Haplotypes, which he called J1 and J2. """"Pinchas, the zealot mentioned in the Bible, may be the origin of J2"""" he suggested. 
The extended CMH-12 is established for J1 Cohanim only. If somebody in J1 also has CMH-12, then he is likely to have Cohen ancestry. J1 Cohanim form a tight network around CMH-12. But this is not the case for J2. The CMH-12 does not apply to J2. If a J2 is in CMH-12, it tells us nothing about one being a Cohen. In J2, the CMH-12 has no special status. The J1 lineage of Cohanim in CMH-12 could be much more recent.  Jewish Cohanim in J2 form a much larger network around CMH-6  than Jewish Cohanim in J1 do. Cohanim Jews belong mainly to haplogroup J2 because Cohanim as a group (J1,J2) have a high frequency of J2. The J2 Cohanim have much more ancient common ancestor, according to the *observed* mutation rate (which is three times faster than the standard, """"effective"""" rate). J2 Cohanim serves as the deep background of the priestly Jewish caste (J1,J2). “The finding of J2 among contemporary Cohanim can lend credence that today’s Cohanim (J1,J2) may be descendents of two different founding dynasties – including coalescence to Phinchas as the founder of J2 Cohanim” concluded Dr. Karl Skorecki.

Why the confirmation that Phinchas may be the orign of J2 Cohanim is so important?

“Pinchas, son of Elazar, son of Aharon the Kohen turned back My anger from upon the Children of Yisrael, so I did not destroy the Children of Yisrael. Therefore say - behold, I give to him My covenant of peace” (Numbers 25:10 - 30:1). “God gave to Pinchas a new permanent priesthood, for him and his descendants for all generations.” (Zohar HaKadosh 3:124a). God indicated that Phinchas had acted justly by rewarding him with the most counter-intuitive form of blessing - an all-new form of priesthood.

Peyton Manning and Ben Roethlisberger
I reverted your edit because you just destroyed the continuity of that section. 

As for your claims, I don't see any standards/templates set for what a player's season recap should include. I know the team season recaps are very suspect in not giving out much information, and certaintly not enough for individual players. I think those articles are poorly done, and I'm not interested in improving them. I do not like the prose-style recaps on this site because it becomes way too boring to read line after line of """"In week X of the XXXX season, Player X did this and that against Team X in a XX-XX win/loss..."""" For the longest time that's how Drew Brees' 2009 season (a great individual season that deserves better writing) read. It still has some of those problems. 

The way I've done it gives it structure. You don't have to repeat who the opponent was, what week it was or the result. And these are NFL players. They'll play 16 games a year, 20 at the most with the playoffs. I'm not writing what a NBA or MLB player did in 82 or 162 games. It's a small sample. Write a sentence or two for each game and you're talking 16-40 sentences at the most. Hardly creates a long section.

I really suggest you look at Denard Robinson (Michigan QB) and his current season recap. He has sub-sections with lots of text for each individual game this year. And you know what, I don't see anyone changing it or complaining about it. It doesn't bother me. While I would never make anything like that for the NFL players (so don't get worried), I have to say their info is written pretty well and it's sourced and everything. That much info on one game is pretty crazy, but you know what, where are the restrictions on space?

Come on man, this is the internet. We're not limited to page restrictions for some paper encyclopedia. The space is there. I'll make sure to refrain from any further mention of team-oriented things like """"going on a bye week"""", but other than that, the text has been about Ben, so it's on topic and referenced. I don't see the big deal, and I can't say I'm seeing other people questioning it besides yourself. I didn't even start Manning's 2010 season using it because I was waiting to see what kind of season he was having, but someone else went ahead and formatted it that way today. Looks fine to me. And since there's been free reign given on these kind of sections, again, I don't see the problem.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Greetings from the Opera Project again 

Hi, Satyr.  You'll remember that you and your bot did some excellent work for us (on the Wagner sub-project) a few months ago.  How are you fixed at present?  We'd like to dip a bigger toe in the assessment process by automatically giving a """"Start"""" rating to those articles that are tagged with the Opera Project banner and are not already classified as Stub.

Exceptions:  articles which have been promoted to Good Article, Featured Article or Featured List should show those ratings on the banner.  Also, it would be good if any articles which currently show Stub on the banner but have been manually de-stubbed without the banner having been altered could be rated Start.

We'd like the facility to comment when we start doing the assessments.  For the Wagner project, you organised it so that the banner carries a dormant link:  if a comments page is present, there's a link, but if not, not.  The link will nevertheless appear (and work) if a comments page is subsequently added.

I can give some examples of the various possibilities outlined above if that would help, and you might like to review our correspondence about the Wagner project to refresh your memory of what you did then (also to refresh your memory of how useless we were then at specifying what exactly we wanted, maybe!).

Hello, . Despite 's statement, you have not so far been reported at WP:Administrator intervention against vandalism as far as I can see; but if you continue your disruptive editing you will be. Looking at your edits, I get that you have strong opinions about John de Ruiter. While I know nothing of him, I have some sympathy with your position. But you are going about your campaign in a way that is disruptive to Wikipedia, and you need to stop.
First, as you have already been told, you introduced material (and, in particular, critical material) into a biography of a living person without giving any references to a published source which supports your material. This is absolutely forbidden, but the first time you did it our policy of assuming good faith should lead any other editor to just remove your additions and explain to you that this is not acceptable; and this is what happened.
What you are encouraged to do at that point, is to discuss the matter on the talk page Talk:John de Ruiter, and try to reach agreement with other editors; if you are unable to do so, our dispute resolution procedure would tell you how to proceed.
What you did do, is to insert your unsupported material again. This is called edit warring, and is a quick way to get yourself blocked from Wikipedia.

Assuming that you are in good faith (i.e. that you think the de Ruiter article is unbalanced), your best bet is to start by finding some reliable published sources which are critical of him (not blogs or forums, but material from reputable publishers). If you can find some, then you may edit the article to add only what is supported by the sources you have found (though in view of your recent history, even in this case you should probably start by discussing it on the talk page). If you cannot find such sources, then I'm afraid you must not edit the page further. Unsupported material and original research are not permitted in Wikipedia articles.

I suspect that you believe that it is important to expose something you think is not right about how de Ruiter presents himself. If that is that case, I'm afraid that Wikipedia is not a soapbox, and you may not use it in that way.",0,0,0,0,0,0

99d98bd28aed53b4,"Context of the Women's Health Movement 
I think it is important to note the context of which Carol Downer figured out how to do vaginal self-exam and menstrual extraction during the woman’s health movement at this time, the early 1970’s, abortion, birth control and fertility information were not available to women. In addition, there were an estimated 5000 deaths a year from illegal abortion. This concept helped put reproduction and the woman’s body back into the hands of the woman in a safe way. I also feel as though some of the language used in this article has a negative connotation. For example, when it is stated that she “promoted a procedure called menstrual extraction... if she were pregnant, this would constitute a non-professional abortion.” it sounds as if the article is trying to claim that she promoted abortions, which isn’t necessarily true. What she did promote was women reclaiming their bodies and taking them out of the hands of the male-dominated medical world and into their own. She PROVIDED women with means to learn about their bodies at a time where birth control did not exist. I also think it should be noted that after Roe v. Wade, she traveled to Europe, Canada, New Zealand and Mexico, to name a few, and attended national and international conferences as advocates of women’s health rights. In addition, I think it should be specified what the Roe v. Wade decision entailed, and how it made abortion legalized so she was therefore able to establish the women-run clinics. Roe v. Wade has a Wikipedia article and can be linked. 

These contributions are important because the context all of this was a very important time in Women’s Health History. Mentioning the context of the women’s health movement and how she was providing women with the means to take control of their fertility and reproduction when they had no other means to do so and could even face legal persecutions if they did. By adding this, the article will make more sense, especially because it mentions her arrest and things like the Roe v. Wade trial.

From an ES/WGS perspective, the revolutionary time where woman began to take back the control of their bodies. There are many misconceptions around things like abortion even still today. Woman have been criminalized for performing or having abortions in history and even today. And I think it is important to take note of that. Also, Carol Downer has played such a crucial role in Women’s Health and Feminist activism, I was surprised at how short her article was. I also think that The Women’s Health Movement should have it’s own article on Wikipedia (currently there is “Feminist health centers” and “Women’s Health” and “Feminist Movement”)",0,0,0,0,0,0

 regarding International humanitarian law 

The protection of hospitals is according to the Geneva convention. The agreement from 1949 was also signed and ratified by the USA.
According to that agreement hospitals are protected.
The exception is: unless the facilities """"are being used, outside their humanitarian function, to commit acts harmful to the enemy"""" as rightly commented in the article. But: Even if enemy combatants are inappropriately using the facility for shelter, the """"rule of proportionality"""" usually forbids such attacks because of the high potential for civilian casualties. (why the usually as a qualifier?)
And it is not the: Human rights organization Human Rights Watch stated that the laws of war require the attacking force to issue a warning, and wait a reasonable time for a response, before attacking a medical unit being misused by combatants.
but the Geneva convention itself that requires a warning by the attacking force. And that is not a choice.
Why having qualifiers, as if the Geneva convention is not clear on the point of the protection of a hospital. And this scenario, an unannounced air strike by an AC-130 definitely falls outside a hypothetical proportional attack.
Why being so ambiguous about it, the Geneva conventions forbids the attack on a hospital, except in exceptional circumstances!  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

True. Both libertarians and conservatives in the modern Western world want low taxes, small government and individual freedom and responsibility. However, the difference is that libertarianism is a fixed ideology, while conservatism as an ideology varies between time periods and societies; for instance, nineteenth-century conservatism was about preserving monarchical and aristocratic rule and was totally different from modern conservatism. I think the quote I added to the first paragraph sums that up quite well: """"who are the 'conservatives' in today's Russia? Are they the unreconstructed Stalinists, or the reformers who have adopted the right-wing views of modern conservatives such as Margaret Thatcher? Basically, conservatism, when considered across the whole of history, is a term so vague as to be impossible to define - which makes this article inherently fairly impossible to write.

 More content and sources to be added 

The suggestion made above that this article could be deleted or merged as not notable represents a truly extraordinary """"reach"""". As was noted previously, the specific phrase that gives this article its title is used and discussed in literature from sources as diverse as the Air Force Research Institute and Israel's own Goldstone Mission report, which employes it extensively. Already mentioned in the article, is the (also extensive) discussion of the term in a report by the internationally recognized human rights organization, the Public Committee Against Torture in IsraelNo Second Thoughts: The Changes in the Israeli Defense Forces Combat Doctrine in Light of Operation Cast Lead, a report by the Public Committee Against Torture in Israel; executive summary, with full report discussing Dahiya doctrine also downloadable at no cost.

Not yet mentioned are papers from the Brookings Institution, one of the most prominent thinktanks in the world, where a new-this-month analysis also discusses the doctrine in considerable depth.The Next War: How Another Conflict Between Hizballah and Israel Could Look and How Both Sides Are Preparing For It, an August 2011 analysis paper by the Brookings Institution; executive summary, with full report discussing Dahiya doctrine also downloadable at no cost.. Nor are any of the multiple scholarly articles that use and discuss the phrase and the policy it identifies mentioned in the article; see footnote.Search Google Scholar for """"Dahiya doctrine"""" (some sifting and use of spelling variants required); one example that discusses the concept under this name at some length is Legislative Attack, by Eyal Weizman, published in 2010 by the highly-ranked journal Theory, Culture & Society. A full-text copy can currently be downloaded from here, at a site that appears to correspond to a university course offering by its author.

Dershowitz even uses and discusses the phrase, as do Noam ChomskyNoam Chomsky interview in """"City"""" magazine, Tel Aviv edition, available on Chomsky's website or in its original context, here, at the magazine's site. and Norman Finkelstein, although Finkelstein calls it the """"Dahiya strategy"""" in his book, This Time We Went Too Far, not mentioned previously here.This Time We Went Too Far, a book by Norman Finkelstein..

Besides the JPost, Haaretz, and Y-net links already mentioned, Al Jazeerah uses the phrase.Al Jazeerah op-ed by Stephen Lendman, 31 May 2010. The New York Times also uses it, and discusses its implications.Tough Military Stance Stirs Little Debate in Israel, by Isabel Kershner, 24 December 2009, The New York Times. ( Access to NYT articles via clickthrough from a google search may be necessary if given NYT links don't work for you. NYT has a new paywall policy that went into effect recently. ) My local access point for the Proquest newspaper database has been down for maintenance most of the day, but I imagine a search via that indexing/""""clipping"""" service would yield more newspaper results, as well.

Btw, like other sources, the New York Times article I cited very properly refers to a particular statement made by an Israeli Colonel ( now in the reserves ) and """"senior advisor to the IDF"""" named Gabriele """"Gabi"""" Siboni, and our own article should, too.

The version that you keep reverting to is at least as anti-contra as the other version is """"pro-contra."""" The irony is that while the Sandinistas themselves have been willing to admit their errors and have reached out to win the votes of former rebels and their sympathizers, some of their foreign supporters seem to be stuck in their circa 1986 vision of Nicaragua. Some Wikipedia editors are holding to views about the contras that even the Sandinistas don't believe anymore.

For instance, while pro-contra editors like to emphasize the role of the MILPAS, anti-contra editors prefer to emphasize the role of former Guardsmen. Yet even Envio, in its February 1987 review of the contra war, noted that Dimas' MILPAS rebellion was """"the most serious episode"""" of the early part of the war.

On the other hand, your favored version reads that """"many members"""" of the old Guard were involved in forming early groups like the 15th of September Legion. But even writers who were hardly pro-contra, like Christopher Dickey and Roy Gutman, have noted how tiny these groups were.

Nikola, your claim that the list of the UNMIK pillars are """"propaganda and add nothing to readers' knowledge about UNMIK"""" is ridiculous. If you have a look at the UNMIK website, you'll see that the pillars are absolutely central to UNMIK's organisation - each pillar is in fact a sub-organisation of UNMIK with its own head. See http://www.unmikonline.org/structure.htm for details. 

Also, your commentary - """"It is generally considered that UNMIK failed in all of these tasks."""" - is both POV and far too vague. Who considers this to be the case? How has UNMIK failed? Where and when? You don't answer these questions. There's certainly room for an overview of UNMIK's activities and success (or lack of it).

Let me refresh your memory.

pjacobi: Delete - one person's theory, not in any way in contact with academic reserach. Pjacobi  

My response: Who cares how many people wrote it, or whether it is """"in contact with academic reserach""""? If you want to read about things that are """"in contact with academic reserach"""", you should subscribe to academic journals. Wikipedia is not an appendage of academia, and the CTMU nowhere relies on """"contact with academic reserach"""" to make its points. Please, let's keep our eyes on the ball here. Asmodeus  

Now please read carefully.

1. Most theories are written by one person; others are free to utilize them (or not) in their own work later on down the line, as they choose. That others have not yet chosen to do so need not reflect on the theory or its applicability to important issues, particularly given the polarization associated with the central focus of the scholastic journal in which the CTMU was published. This is not necessarily a reflection on the theory; it is more likely pertinent to the philosophical assumptions under which others are working, which - inasmuch as we are, after all, talking about philosophy - may ultimately lead nowhere. Indeed, it may merely mean that other scholars are unfamiliar with the theory because they only pay attention to a narrow or professionally closed set of sources. You have improperly recommended this article for deletion on those grounds, and that was wrong of you as a Wikipedia editor.

This leads us to

2. It makes no difference whether a theory is """"notable to academic researchers"""" (whether or not this is the case). It has been patiently explained to you that academics are not the ones who make this particular theory notable; it is notable because it was covered by highly reputable sources in the popular media, and because it has a remarkable structure that no other theory possesses. Again, citing the superficially apparent inattention of academia as grounds for deletion was irresponsible of you as a Wikipedia editor.

You have voted to delete an informative, well-verified article about a notable topic on irrelevant or nebulous grounds for which you have no verification. In so doing, you have let Wikipedia and its readership down. Please be more responsible about your editing activities in the future.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 WP:FILM coordinator 

Hey, I saw your message concerning the upcoming elections for WP:FILM concerning the project coordinators and that you might be adding more. I'm a bit confused concerning the scope of their responsibilities. Is it largely updating , reviewing articles, and aiding in the establishment of task forces (at least as far as I can see)? Do coordinators generally specialize in various areas (i.e. one handles task forces, others reviewing, or a combination of any such duties)? If so, I was wondering whether I could specialize as a coordinator for featured lists. I rank second in terms of total featured lists made among all Wikipedians, and I have a very good grasp of what is required for FL status. If I was elected, I probably would work towards encouraging featured lists under WP:FILM's scope, and there certainly are a host of lists that could be pushed up to FL status with a coordinated effort. That said, I understand that I'm relatively new to the film project, and that there might be more suitable candidates who are more familiar with the project.

PeeJay I have to disagree with some of your statements, “Seems pretty categorical that the name the club gives itself in English should be the one we use here”.  If Pele calls himself Pele all over the world in Spanish, German, Italian etc but wants to give himself the name “Frogman” in English – it doesn’t mean that everyone has to agree with him or call him this.  Especially if every English speaking person knows of Pele as Pele.  To be listed as anything else in a reference encyclopedia like this one is just problematic.  So in this case it should be listed as what it is known as  and used widespreadly which is Inter Milan.
Also you mention “you can clearly see you've reached the right page from the opening sentence” but lots of people will be confused – which shouldn’t happen.  The page is also difficult to find and an example of this is from a Google search for the words “Inter Milan” – you would expect for a Wikipedia article to appear on the search results but the Wikipedia article  does not appear ANYWHERE on Google because of the current naming convention. []
You say people will “learn something in the process”, but this is irrelevant as the primary things to do, the BASIC thing that has to be done on an encyclopedia is to “reference information” that “can be quickly found when needed” and not appearing in Google search results because of a badly named article is not helping people quickly access information.
Kauffner suggests that if the club calls itself Inter then that is another reason to include it in the (full) title ie Inter Milan (NOT to name the article Inter)
Also the club DOES refer to itself as Inter Milan and here is the evidence to back this up:  the Google search result text for “InterMilan” displays the official English title of their website given from Inter Milan’s HTML = (Top Google result + 3rd Sentence down) [].  The HTML can also be viewed by going to the website homepage, right clicking the page, then view page source, CTRL F to search for “Inter Milan” and it is the 2nd result = """"Inter Milan official website""""  []      '''' [ talk ]  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dear Mr McLaughlin,

With regards to your persistent efforts of keeping the old spelling of the capital of Ukraine. For your information:

 It is spelled as Kyiv in English language because:
 1) Ukrainian government insists on Kyiv spelling
 2) The State Department of the U.S. issued a directive to write Kyiv
 3) The Prime Minister of the U.K. calls the city Kyiv - http://www.number10.gov.uk/Page20199
 4) United Nations Multilingual Terminology Database (the ultimate body on geographical names) approved it as Kyiv - http://unterm.un.org/dgaacs/unterm.nsf/WebView/B57BF6AB5F06749B85256DC700440AAD?OpenDocument
 5) Major English speaking governments worldwide switched to Kyiv spelling
 6) CIA refers to the city as Kyiv - https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/up.html
 7) The name of the famous football club is Dynamo Kyiv (recognised worldwide)
 8) Many papers, e.g., British The Guardian, are already writing Kyiv
 9) All major Canadian media already use the spelling of Kyiv
 10) and many more reasons and references on http://kyiv.of-cour.se/

If we only listen to your arguments, we would be also correcting Almaty to Alma-Ata. However, it is Almaty and Kyiv it is of course. Above you have had enough of proofs and strong arguments of usage of the name Kyiv in the modern English language, so it is time to catch up and finally fix the name to Kyiv.

If an admins reviews the complete history of astrotheology, they will notice that I've been patient while I had to deal with other editors extreme language at me. That creates a very stressful situation. Please see here for outside opinion. I did not use the same kind of language against Hrafn, and he had no right to immediately jump on my case while I added content to the article. I was the only active contributor to that astrotheology that was adding content to it, even before the AfD process. I noticed it was a stub and started to add content. How am I being disruptive to other there, when there was no other editors that wanted to contribute? I even listed 30 potential sources on the talk page that had mentions of astrotheology. Others could have reviewed them and find if they had anything worthwhile if they actually wanted to be """"an editor of astrotheology"""" and *add content*. Hrafn, on the talk page, even labeled me as an atheist and other categorized pov pusher. It is obvious he was against something, but that something wasn't me like he thought, and he couldn't believe otherwise  or choose not to. Somehow this went from something that was just a little beyond a content dispute because of the harassment I got from Hrafn, to where Durova stepped in and it went directly to ArbCom. She did ask about PastorDavid, but I looked and I left evidence on AN/I of why I didn't accept his offer  that is not a refusal to dispute resolution, that is seeing that the one who offered mentor made a questionable vote on an AfD. I felt another mentor/mediator, would be best. (Personal attack/comment redacted by   ) If you look however, I did ask on the talk page for astrotheology to Hrafn about RS/N over the Physico-Theology book... he didn't answer at all to that question, but he went on to despise me instead with more """"egregious misintrepretations."""" As for the previous dispute resolution attempts before that Durova noted, those weren't because of disruptive editing. I never caused anybody to leave wikipedia.

*  *  *

I look at a lot of articles (such as BillCJ and many others and it reminds me of books that were published in the 1950 - lots and lots of facts boring, dull uninteresting pictures - picture with no history surrounding what is being published.  In the 1980-90's, a lot of True Aviation historians (i.e. Roger Freeman, Jeff Ethell, Warbirds Worldwide, etc..) found that aviation historians wanted and needed history recorded.  The captions of their books detailed who, what, when, where, etc...  As we progressed into the 2000's, I am finding that today’s writers unfortunately, want to dumb down the article - instead of giving all the details to allow the readers to decide how much level of detail he wants - Again, unfortunately, BillCJ (as well as others) want to take the Dick & Jane approach to aviation history.

This is suppose to be an online reference/encyclopedia - often when you Google an item, the wiki article is the first reference to pop-up so this will be (unfortunately) the first and only reference many will have for a subject.  A subject has to include everyone that references and item, whether it be a 4 year old doing his first model airplane, the aviation historian, the F-16 Buff.  These articles are also used by serious models who want the details.

Articles only tell part of the story - you need the pictures to compliment and point out what the article is discussing.  In the same vein, the pictures need the same level of detailed study (if possible) and care that is place in creating the entire article.  Having a great and fantastic article (such as the F-16) with kindergarten captions makes the entire article pointless.

It is also unfortunate that other editors like Askari Mark feels that detailed captions are meaningless to most readers - again, you can not have an online reference/encyclopedia without filling crossing the t and doting the i's.  Without detailed captions, it like having no reference section - sure you can print captions that state """" Gee an F-16 in Flight """" - especially when it is clear that the airplane is sitting on the ground.  Or the case of one article """"Aircraft is on a bomb-run"""" when it was clear from the picture that the bomb-bay doors were closed, no guns in the waist position and the detailed history showed the aircraft actually was a trainer and never left the United State...

BillCJ also mentioned """" are you seriously suggesting that """" serious historians """" only read WP articles for the pictures? """" - it is a proven fact that 90% of all information processed by humans come from Visual"""" data (i.e. pictures, etc...) - this is the reason Picture books are popular with preschoolers.  The first thing a majority humans look out when reading any thing is the pictures - if the pictures are interesting then many people will stop and read.  If an aviation historian comes across an article that details the subject matter then he will stop and read the contents.

It is also been said that this article is not for the F-16 Buffs - if this is the case, then 
 why have technical specifications
 why have details on each variation??  
 Why have the nuts and bolts of each individual user??
 Etc, Etc, Etc...
Why have detailed information regarding anything regarding the aircraft if this subject is not going to reach out to those who can say yes, this is true (i.e. the historian/buff) - If you are going to have the nuts and bolts in the article then you have to carry this same thought patterns over to have the nuts and bolts details in the photo captions.... (for example: B-52 Specifications, B-52 Costs, B-52 Variants) etc...  this type of informations IS for the Aviation Historian / Buff and generally not for the casual reader (which is MY point in having detailed captions).

If we dumbdown the photocaptions for the """"causual reader, then this level of details Specifications, costs, variations also needs to be removed as it will only confuse the """" casual reader """" and will lead to people calling all such information """" gobbledy-gook """".

If we dumbdown the photocaptions or call detailed information """" gobbledy-gook to most readers """" then terms such as: Wing area, Airfoil, Zero-lift drag coefficient, Drag area, Aspect ratio, Maximum speed:, Combat radius:, Ferry range, Service ceiling ,Rate of climb, Wing loading, Thrust/weight, Lift-to-drag ratio are """"gobbledy-gook to most non-aviation readers""""

 Abolishing the Wikipedia Bans As a Governance Tool 
The following article originally appeared as an add-on comment in the P2P Foundation's blog. Michael Bauwens, the editor of the site, elevated the comment to a main article in its own right.
The governance model of Wikipedia was so anachronistic that it took me over a year to place it in the timeline of historic governance models adopted at various times in the annals of human history.

The thing that stymied me was the prominence of blocking and banning as the primary tool of governance. I simply couldn’t place that among the recognized tools of governance in any historic context.

And then I happened to take a look at the oldest surviving account of secular law — the Code of Hammurabi of 1760 BC.

Of the 282 laws that Hammurabi of Mesopotamia carved into the stone tablets, take note of the very first one:
1. If any one ensnare another, putting a ban upon him, but he can not prove it, then he that ensnared him shall be put to death.
Evidently, banning (ostracism) was a common practice in the tribal cultures in the Middle East some 4000 years ago, at the dawn of civilization. Capricious and spurious banning was evidently such a common and egregious abuse of tribal overlords that Hammurabi made it a capital offense to ban someone without proving just cause.

And yet, on Wikipedia, indefinite blocks and bans without due process are a common occurrence. That is to say, the prevailing governance model of Wikipedia corresponds to a pre-Hammurabic tribal ochlocracy that is so anachronistic, it predates the advent of the Rule of Law.

When Thomas Jefferson and the other Founders drafted the US Constitution, one of the provisions they put in Article One was a prohibition against Bills of Attainder. A Bill of Attainder is the technical term in the law for declaring a person to be an outlaw (without respect to having violated any specific law that applies equally to everyone). The Founders excluded Bills of Attainder from the tools of governance because 4000 years of political history had demonstrated that such a toxic practice is corrosive and ridden with corruption, and invariably sinks any government that comes to rely on it.

The irony here is that Wikipedia purports to be the “sum of all knowledge” with an educational mission that reaches out to students, teachers, and scholars around the world. And yet those exercising power in Wikipedia have not yet learned the oldest and most profound lessons in the annals of human history — lessons enshrined in the first written law and in the first article of the US Constitution.

The consequence of adopting such an anachronistic governance model is that Wikipedians are fated to relive and reify the long-forgotten lessons of history. They relive those lessons by reprising the same kind of political dramas that fill the history books since the dawn of civilization.

The anachronistic governance model which Jimbo Wales foolishly and mindlessly introjected into Wikipedia is simply not a sustainable model in this day and age. Summary and capricious banning wasn’t even a sustainable model some 3768 years ago when Hammurabi first singled it out as an unacceptable practice in a civilized culture.

So what to do about it? The answer can be found in the second law of Hammurabi’s Code. As Hammurabi advises, the solution is to tell them to go jump in the lake.

Or as they say in Yiddish, “Nem zich a vaneh!“

""""The erosion of African names also occurred. Samba, meaning comfort in Wolof, is still recalled in musical form in Brazil, where there remains a strong African presence. A possible derivation of Samba is Zambo (Southern/Central Africa), which also means to give comfort. Other derivatives are Sambu in Mandinka and Sambo in Hausa. The fact that the name was at one time fairly common and no longer used may have relationship to a song popularized by white Americans during the war from 1861-1865, """"Sambo's Right To Be Kilt,"""" and especially the derogatory usage of the name enshrined in the book Little Black Sambo.""""

  Lebanon: Catholic Villagers attack and vandalize Baptist Church
Posted on 29 August, 2006

 Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. 

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. 

Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 

A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. 

“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” 

Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. 

In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. 

Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” 

In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. 

In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. 

“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” 

As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” 

Worship Rights 

In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. 

The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. 

“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue?

 Replaceable fair use Image:Chloe.jpg

I noticed the description page specifies that the media is being used under a claim of fair use, but its use in Wikipedia articles fails our first non-free content criterion in that it illustrates a subject for which a freely licensed media could reasonably be found or created that provides substantially the same information. If you believe this media is not replaceable, please:

 Go to the media description page and edit it to add , without deleting the original replaceable fair use template.
 On the image discussion page, write the reason why this image is not replaceable at all.

Alternatively, you can also choose to replace this non-free media by finding freely licensed media of the same subject, requesting that the copyright holder release this (or similar) media under a free license, or by taking a picture of it yourself.

Speedy deletion of SupportSpace
 A tag has been placed on SupportSpace, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section G11 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article seems to be blatant advertising which only promotes a company, product, group, service or person and would need to be fundamentally rewritten in order to become an encyclopedia article.

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Edits to The College of Saint Mary Magdalen
This edit on 7 January 2012 removed some documented, sourced material from the article. It is unusual for an editor to delete sourced material without consensus from other editors, and this edit draws attention because the deleted material relates to an unflattering aspect of part of the College's history.

Fenris has been at Gamefaqs for nearly 4 years, whereas I have only stumbled across Gamefaqs in early 2005. I have seen Fenriswolf's posts in the Asia and Japan regional boards, and from the nature of them he seems to be a loyal, unquestioned admirer of the Chinese communist government. Myself however, is an Australian citizen. Although I do not oppose the Chinese government, I support eventual democracy in China, and can at least acknowledges its negative aspects. If I was indeed a mindless follower of the Chinese government, then why didn't I remove entire sections of articles such as Falun Gong and Epoch Times regarding negative aspects of the government? I reverts some of TJive's edits due to his choice of wording, such as his insistance in calling certain governments """"regimes"""", and his tendency to edit without discussion, dismissing me as a stooge of the Chinese government on his user page.. If you look at my edit history, I do not delibrately start any vandalism or edit wars, and has contributed lots to science-fiction and videogame related articles.

Thanks Mackan, for the assist.  I am not sure I follow all points contested above; if anyone's wondering, no I did not find the oafishness or general vulgarity of mind displayed on that talk page to be lovable.  I am not particularly exercised about this, and though I think the block was illegitimate, I have no plan to pursue the matter further.  The only statement in this thread that I find objectionable is Shell's professed wish to see me """"take civility more seriously in the future.""""  I take civility very seriously, Shell; indeed I believe I take it more seriously than you do.  I think your careless suggestion to the contrary – like the ill-considered block itself – reflects a slack, even indefensible understanding of WP:CIVIL, wherein the only measure of incivility is the temperature of remarks. 

I am also a little puzzled by your reading of nine or ten identical frat-boy beer belches as a """"commendable"""" effort to """"keep things light.""""  We all have different sensibilities, and you're certainly entitled to yours.  But be aware that here is my attempt to keep things light in the face of obstructionism.  Note that in this case there is a point to the playfulness: the weight, authority, influence, and reliability of sources is not – contra Jayjg – a function of their print run.  Jay's response to this lightness was to say, again and again, that I had """"strawmanned"""" him (while steadfastly refusing to clarify his point or show how I'd distorted it), then to attack me directly and personally and say I've never in the past shown the """"grace or honesty to admit"""" when I've lied about such matters, and so was unlikely to admit my deceptions in this instance.  And then began the beer-belching frat-boy hazing extravaganza you found so commendably charming.  All of this in a thread that began with Jay's personal attack on PR, alongside the spurious point downplaying Haaretz as a source – the same spurious point all subsequent accurate references to which he dismissed as """"strawmen"""".  

One girl's trash is another's treasure, Shell, and while you have the right to be charmed by what you find charming, you shouldn't conclude that those with different sensibilities have manners less beautiful than yours.

You as an administrator are above all a user like any other user, administrative privilages should only be used when a user is disturbing, so for you to warn me, you should justify how telling someone that he refuse to listen, when he really refuse to listen warrant to a warning, or how am I disturbing. It is to you to convince me now that your blocking of a contributor a Wikipedian as much as you is not disturbing. Also, that you refuse to accept your mistake on the face of the obvious doesn't give a good opinion of you. But I am sure, that is the last of your worries. Just consider that everyone make mistakes, whatever or not they recognize it is what matters.  (ix)",0,0,0,0,0,0

I interpret silence as no contention, and have moved the item here:
It is not easier to balance an egg on its end on the first day of spring. In fact, the ease or difficulty of balancing an egg is the same throughout the year. This myth is said to originate with the egg of Li Chun, an ancient Chinese folk belief that it is easier to balance an egg on Li Chun, the first day of spring in the Chinese calendar. In Chinese Li means setup/erect, Chun spring/egg. Setup spring is a Chinese solar term, literally interpreted as erecting an egg for fun. It was introduced to the western world in a Life article in 1945, and popularized once again by self-titled """"urban shaman"""" Donna Henes, who has hosted an annual egg-balancing ceremony in New York City since the mid-1970s.

whatever....I did NOT say I would edit war, in fact I said I would be careful NOT actually edit war, but to simply place a word that belongs in the article, that Nova keeps having issues with.   Are you saying that I don't have the right in the """"future"""" to ever put in anything simply cuz Nova would object?     My hands would have to be tied, you're saying??

I don't like how you jumped the gun and twisted what I said around, where I specifically said I would NOT """"edit war"""", but would not put up with suppression of facts, simply cuz Nova doesn't like them. Also, the """"personal attacks"""" are merely facts about this individual that can be easily looked up. I'm not the only one who doesn't like him or what he does.    Actually at this point I don't care...I'm tired of the insanity.....I have other things to do, and this nonsense is too time-consuming anyway.  For real.   This person Nova made it """"personal"""" long before I did, with his actions.    Again, there are others who feel the same way....  I'm not the only one he's upset with his constant edit warring and disrespect.  So you looking only at me, and misunderstanding my words and my intent.    I was seriously planning to be done with Wikipedia for a long while anyway. (I have other accounts and even other IPs anyway.....but I probably won't even use them, as I don't really care to be wasting time on this stuff, anymore.)  Nova has no business on Wikipedia. He's an insufferable joke.  And I don't care that it's a personal attack. Since I'm blocked anyway, I might as well make it worth it.   He should just get lost from all articles, he adds nothing but aggravation and a barrage of insanity.    

Again, I'm NOT the only one who's been a victim of his crazy nonsense.    Yet that nutball stays unblocked, yet he is the CAUSE of it all the problems.    Interesting.  As I said, whatever.....I contributed a lot to WP in 5 short months (my first edit in Feb 2008 does not count, as that was just playing around....I got serious with WP in February 2010....)....with meaningful additions, corrections, source editing, vandalism removal, grammar correction, section adding, creation of a few articles.....etc.   I never even intended to get into this, it was all an accident when I couldn't find some topics on WP that I thought would be, so I decided to create some articles....and then get caught up in this stuff.   Much to my chagrin.   I have better (for real) things to do.    I don't care that much that I'm blocked......but it's the principle that it's sort of unfair, and you misunderstand (and actually twisted) my words around.....and this maniac (more personal attacks, so I'm making it good) gets off basically scott-free.......EVEN THOUGH I CAN SHOW YOU EXAMPLES OF WHERE HE'S BEEN AN INSUFFERABLE TARD WITH OTHER PEOPLE TOO.    You'll overlook that of course.     Cuz Nova knows how to manipulate WP and WP Admins fairly well, I've noticed.    Though I know that some Admins see his nonsense too.    

Anyway, again.....to re-iterate.....I did not say I would """"edit war"""" but would simply exercise my rights to put in words in an article, despite Nova's own constant edit warring and neurotic objections to everything.    And I said I would be careful NOT to violate 3RR as well as NOT brazenly """"edit war"""".     Of course you see it as a threat to """"edit war"""" anyway...

The reason another admin stated for my last block (that Dicklyon brought upon me last weekend, for 48 hrs), was also edit war. However, it was only me who got blocked that time. In my complaint I requested that BOTH parties be punished because a war involves two or more parties, but my request for DENIED. Now you are saying I got a 24 hrs block because a war takes two parties? How ridiculous is this! As far as other 24 hrs are concerned, where did I insult Dicklyon personally? I talked about his worthless edits, not him, and I have all right to talk about his edits because it was the page I wrote that has been featured on WP main page; he is just a trouble maker – see his Talk page to see how many enemies he has created, besides a few personal buddies of his like SamBlacketer who lies on your Talk page about """"many editors"""" who have blocked me (it was Dicklyon actually) and calls my WP featured article a fringe theory  how can he tell if he admits having no clue about the article topic in the first place?  As far as the dispute resolve, all my reasons are stated right on the article Discussion so I am not hiding anything.

 Random tagging

Needless to say that when one source leads to a 404 page and another is some commercial menu which does not match the citation because it has probably been removed and defaults to a home page, that is not """"random"""", it is logically applied tagging based on factual concerns regarding the citations.

I don't know how large your local paper is; my experience with larger papers is that they verify the author to at least a basic degree (believe me, the items I was writing about are not nearly as contentious as the matter at hand here, nor am I in a position akin to the rector's.) And in a situation like this, there would certainly be a correction if the rector claimed the letter wasn't his, and no such correction appears. As such, that the rector made the statement seems to me quite adequately sourced, even if the claims he makes are not. However, if you would like to slightly reword it to make it even clearer that the rector is making claims that are not otherwise in evidence (replacing stated with claimed or asserted), I would not have an objection.
I think the claim, even if treated as true, is not much of a claim; the count of accused priests has an invisible """"yet"""" hanging over it, as more recent graduates would have had less time to have accusers come forward than those from previous classes. And I think the reference is good to have in there for something it -doesn't- include; the letter is essentially a """"yes, but"""" note rather than a """"no"""" note, as it doesn't deny anything in the Times article and thus to some degree blunts any objection that it's just the Times reporters say-so.

Imagine finding an article in which every single word is wrong and you will imagine my pain at reading the current Martin Heidegger article. Nor am I the only one who thinks this. Please see the section immediately above this article. Or better yet, spend the next 24 hours reading the first sections of Sein und Zeit and you will see the ridiculousness of the article as it currently stands, which demonstrates no understanding of Heidegger, and leaves everyone who reads it dumber than  when they began and knowing less about everything. This is so atrocious that essentially the entire article as it stands needs to be deleted and began again. I have no more time for this.   

I tried to move the Dreyfus to the main article and now apparently all the material is destroyed. Do you have any comprehension of how bad this article currently is? One would have no idea that Heidegger was ever read anywhere outside of France from the current article. No summaries of Heidegger's important concepts are given. No understanding of any of Heidegger's ideas are conveyed. Since you have decided to destroy my work, you can keep your poor article, which reads as if it was machine-translated from a foreign language. You do not even let someone in the middle of working finish before you destroy their work. No wonder zero academics contribute to this site and your articles are so atrocious. Anyone who reads the article as it currently stands comes away knowing less about Heidegger than they did before because of all of the obvious distortions and gross inaccuracies. You have not even succesfully explained a single one of Heidegger's terms or concepts here, or why anyone should care who he is. This article is an embarassment indeed.

Either way, not ready for the responsibility just yet IMHO.  
Oppose - I searched this users edits about turkey related pages, which are a lot and i think he is not neutral at all. the most disturbing thing is that this user seems to be too certain for many subjects which really really contain many uncertainties. i am from turkey and i am not so certain and strict about many turkey related problems which i know and search about for years. i know they are very complicated. i know that many things the turkish goverment and people assert are not true, and many of the opposers are not also. so the only thing this behaviour tells me that whether this user has a narrow view over these subjects or is not trying to be neutral at all.  19:57,",0,0,0,0,0,0

Instead, I'll note that in Wikiquote you can find some """"public statements"""" and """"rhetoric"""" of the sort I note is presently missing.  So, I see three resolutions (a) re-label the section to accurately represent the intention (b) re-work the text to accurately represent the label by e.g. including much of the current contents of wikiquote (c) move much of the quotations to wikiquote, and present a brief neutral description of her public statements with a couple examples from both sides of the spectrum.

IntroductionSecond Paragraph
The source coming from the peak is not appropriate as it does not support what you have written.  The article makes legal distinction between CFS BC and CFS national.  It doesn't support a broad assertion that as you say """"The CFS generally referred to legally consists of 3 separate organizations, the national CFS, a provincial chapter and CFS-Services which are often collectively referred to as CFS""""

Also: """"The organizations generally brand themselves as CFS and do not make the distinction between the branches.""""
Your source does not support that statement. Also """"brand"""" is a corporate term and not NPOV language.

Also: """"In addition, it is impossible to belong to one division and not another making the CFS de-facto one organization"""" Is not supported by the one source you provided.

See the reliable sources policy: """"Sources should directly support the information as it is presented in an article and should be appropriate to the claims made;"""" - WP:RELY

Simon Fraser's The Peak, has a well established and long time editorial bias against CFS so I'm not sure if the article you use is even considered a reliable source.  Again check WP:RELY for all the details

Jayjg, is there any edit to this article you would accept? What are your objections to clarifying ethnic vs. religious definitions of """"Jews""""? The article is currently confusing as to which is which, and it would help to clarify that JfJ means ethnic Jews. I think in the case Mackan points out, """"many"""" is appropriately used-many Jewish groups do see JfJ that way, but certainly not all (I would imagine there are plenty of Jewish groups without any official position on JfJ.) Also, most religions are rather fluid and change over time, and there is often debate over interpretation. It is, therefore, not quite so easy to state religious principles as fact (Jews don't believe in Jesus as Messiah? What about Messianic Judaism?) Of course, religious faith also tends to be given over to a lot of dogmatism (""""my way is the correct one"""" type of thinking), so sometimes it's difficult to see debates to that as valid. WP:WEASEL does not object to ever using """"many"""" or """"most"""" or the like as qualifiers, it advocates against it only in the absence of sourcing. What we have here is a lot of sourcing, which does not, however, show that all Jews object to JfJ (as I explained above, that would be effectively impossible). It does, of course, show that """"many"""" do (I wouldn't even object to """"almost all"""" or """"most""""), but in order to preserve the plausibility requirement of WP:NPOV (JfJ's assertion that it is Jewish must be treated as plausible), it is impossible that all Jewish organizations disagree-as JfJ doesn't!

 Why do you keep deleting a link to the most informative site about Middle Bass Island??? 

Norman,

you have removed the link to the main Middle Bass Island web site several times. That means you don't even look at the contents of the items you remove, which is rather petty and incredibly arrogant.

The site started as a non-commercial site and contains a great deal of island history as well as many, many island pictures. It's one of the most popular sites in the Lake Erie Islands.

Please take a look at """"Site Map Page 1"""" and """"Site Map Page 2"""" before removing the link again. Saying that the hundreds of pages listed there have only commercial value is idiotic.

The site was started out of love for the Lake Erie Islands and Middle Bass Island and the fact that it now carries a number of ads for island businesses does not change the fact that it is mainly a site with island information not available anywhere else.

So what is your real rationale for deleting it again and again and again???

Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings, 
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. 
Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
And now, instead of mounting barded steeds 
To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty 
To strut before a wanton ambling nymph; 
I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, 
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up, 
And that so lamely and unfashionable
That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
And descant on mine own deformity:
And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover, 
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain...

This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, 
This other Eden, demi-paradise, 
This fortress built by Nature for herself
Against infection and the hand of war, 
This happy breed of men, this little world, 
This precious stone set in the silver sea, 
Which serves it in the office of a wall, 
Or as a moat defensive to a house,
Against the envy of less happier lands, 
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England, 
This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings, 
Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth, 
Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
For Christian service and true chivalry, 
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry, 
Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,

Not at all, you are making a straw man argument here. I never claimed O'Donohue had that position, rather that practitioners and researchers in the field ignored the DSM position, which is exactly what the quote says and also something O'Donohue agrees with. 

Again, I was combating the notion that it was a """"absurd part"""" to claim that pedophilia is a sexual orientation. Since many researchers hold this position, it would be unfair to call it absurd. The disorder part is divided in the field, some argue that it is not a disorder at all, some do.

That is a good point about John Locke (I do know who he is, he's even taught in our local middle school, just by the way, haha), he was very influential, but he was a philosopher, not a theologian. Many church goers, whether self-identifying Christians or not, and many self-identifying Christians, whether church-goers or not, do not believe in original sin. I have no idea how many, or what kind of proportion that would be out of the total populations of their respective groups. However, original sin is a biblical doctrine. Babies going to hell because they were not baptised, however, is not. The Bible is not very specific about that issue. It is a Catholic doctrine, yes, but we need to keep doctrines voiced by all of Christianity and parts of Christianity distinct in this article. The Protestant stance is that babies, both born and unborn, whatever they do, are not held accountable until the age of accountability, or the age of reason, at which point they know the difference between right and wrong. Roman Catholicism also holds this idea, so I'm wondering now how babies could go to hell when they can not be held accountable for sin? They have their inherited sinful nature (original sin), sure, but that's different from actually committing a sin. Is the official Roman Catholic stance then that all people are born destined for Hell, whether or not they've actually lived long enough TO sin and thus separate themselves from God and so choose eternal death over eternal life? Honest question here, I'm not trying to bash the Catholic Church.

Hi Legolas95, thank you for acknowledging my concern;
In etymology section, user:sitush has previously suggested while replying to another user - to restore the previous content excluding Sadasivan's book reference.  The concerned sentence from this reference was self-explanatory and was not inclined to any side as to why the term Nayar is derived from Naagar.  Please consider the following point also that the Naga point of etymology was not given consideration because of misinterpretation that real serpents have evolved to constitute Nair population - which is entirely false.  I was really mentioning this census report shall stand as an authentic reference for the same.
My second humble suggestion was to consider the caste system in the article.  I would like to invite your attention to the first sentence ie.
""""The Nambudiri Brahmins were at the top of the ritual caste hierarchy and in that system outranked even the kings.""""
This sentence at the beginning says about the role of Namboodiri class in Kerala as a whole.  This is not about Nairs or the caste system of nairs.  Here the proposed sentence gives little light on the scene ie.
""""Nairs observed no internal caste system till the Brahmin migration occurred in Kerala.""""
This is not promotional to nairs but it indirectly says Brahmin migration has influenced Nair caste system.  My kind opinion is that it is better to remove present first sentence.
Second sentence says,
""""Bulk of them formed the fighting and protecting class, some of whom became chiefs and Naduvazhis. Some sections of the people were engaged in other occupations also.""""
This actually represent all sides of the community.  Tell me if this sentence seems inclined certainly we shall remove this.
The third sentence I consider as little important:  It says,
""""It is a notable point that long before Aryans migrated southwards, Nairs had travelled far beyond the northern tradition of chathurvarna system and developed a multiplicity of castes.""""
This sentence actually demonstrates that Nair community's social structure is prone to faster development.

I have a request to user:Legolas95 user:Sitush and user:Qwyrxian - In the reference under consideration, there is a sentence claiming that 'there is no evidence that before 18th century (before 1700 AD) the term sudra was ever applied to Nairs.'  If this like a sentence requires verification, we need to consider references created before this period.  What in my mind is that if we be little flexible on the matter of older reference - it can help Nair article.    

These were my concerns regarding this census report which are quite eligible to be considered and provides some help towards improvement in the article.    19:27""",0,0,0,0,0,0

1) I didn't say """"one short sentence would be appropriate"""", I said """"so a small sentence on it is relevant"""".
 2) I accept that this point is correct, however, the article mentions that """"Creationist beliefs may be based on creationist theology, creation science, or a combination of both"""" therefore making this criticism completely relevant to the article. Equally, the further criticism of 'creation science' could be applied more widely to creationism as a whole. I am referring here to the sentence, """"Science uses the scientific method to systematically comprehend reality as it is, whereas 'creation science' begins with an assumption and attempts to find evidence or twist facts to support this original assumption.""""
3 )It is more a critical approach towards creationism, rather than simply 'creation science' that I am advocating. This article is misleading in that it appears to add totally equal merit to both creationism and evolution. While this may appear to be in the interests of NPOV, the reality is that the actual evidence for evolution is so hugely overwhelming, that to give an impression of equal validity is itself a bias point. Sorry, but the evidence for evolution is overwhelming, creationism is a pseudo-science of no real merit, and this should be quite clear in the article. I accept that an argument putting forward the 'credentials' of creationism is fair and should be included, but the argument against it should not be tamed in to give the ostensible appearance of neutrality.  17:38, 25 Feb 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

1. Effectively, the only source is one ANONYMOUS article by a person who claims to have been directly involved.  Technically, there are two articles, but the one from 2006 relies only on the one from 1944 as its sole source, and does not indicate that the author of the 2006 did any independent research beyond finding the 1944 article on the Internet.  Generally, Wikipedia does not consider a single unverified first-person account to be sufficient, and that should be especially true when it is anonymous.

2. According to the 1944 article, there should be many, many witnesses.  After 69 years, neither the Pope, nor any of the Vatican officials there with him, nor any of the 80 or so visitors waiting has confirmed that this incident ever happened.  Some of the witnesses, especially the German soldiers, might have died before the story was first published.  However, if it was true, there should have been at least some surviving witnesses.  The lack of any independent verification makes the entire story rather doubtful.

You may also remove the notice if you disagree with the deletion, though in such cases, further discussion may take place at Articles for deletion, and the article may still be deleted if there is a consensus to do so.

Wikipedia has certain standards for inclusion that all articles must meet. Certain types of article must establish the notability of their subject by asserting its importance or significance.

The entire section focuses on the emergence of scenes in countries around the world in 1977 and 1978. Bands from the 1980s aren't discussed for any country. It's not appropriate to discuss those later Brazilian bands here. Use the new Punk in Brazil article Wwwhatsup created for that.
The section introduces the names of no more than three bands per country (France's Stinky Toys are discussed earlier in the article); in many cases, just two. You wanted to add fourteen for Brazil. You should be able to understand how inappropriate that is. We're just focusing in this section on the most important, earliest punk bands in each country.
Every single claim in the section is is followed by a citation, referencing one or more reliable sources. That's how we know we can trust the information there. You haven't provided a single source. You've listed some band names from the late 1970s. Take a look at the article List of Brazilian punk and hardcore groups. That mentions a mostly different set of Brazilian punk bands from the 1970s. Without proper references, how can we trust that we're actually naming the most important bands? Please read the Wikipedia policy on WP:Verifiability.

This section/sentence is a bit wrong headed. 
Periodic trends are those which repeat from period to period (e.g. noble gas behavior recurring). What this really means to talk about is """"horizontal trends"""" across the period. What the article means to say, I guess, is that horizontal trends are due to a quantum shell filling, and since 1s fills within 2 electrons, there's not much scope to look at 'trends'. It's also perhaps worth noting that when Mendelev put the """"periodic"""" table together, he didn't know the noble gases existed, so all he had to place from what would become period 1 was hydrogen.

 To attempt to briefly several of Ed's questions from what I can only hope is an Eastern Orthodox Christian POV:
 * Nothing """"compels"""" a just God to """"enforce"""" a person's separation from Him, save the principle of the person's free will. If a person chooses not to love God, or chooses a life separate from God, that amounts to the same as choosing death, since they are cutting themselves off from the ultimate source of life. Looking at the word """"perish"""" in John 3:16, in Greek it is in neither active nor passive voice, but rather """"middle voice"""", which means a better translation would be """"whoever does not believe in him will destroy himself"""". Living in the presence of an all-loving God while rejecting that love is how some Orthodox theologians describe Hell; hence, God's love is sometimes described as a """"river of fire"""". Hence both God's goodness and justice are preserved, as well as each person's free will.
 * Also, Jesus did not have to die. To say that he was forced to die would imply that some external force or law is greater than God and forced God to act against His will. Eastern Orthodoxy has always rejected this notion, and rather says that Jesus chose to lay down his life in order trample down death by death. When Death tried to swallow up the the Giver of Life, Death's power was overcome. As for alternative plans, none are discussed, but that's not the same as saying that God had no choice or was compelled by something or someone else. Some Church Fathers speak of Christ triumphantly mounting the Cross like a steed.
 * The Jews did not have to accept Jesus as their Messiah. He simply was their Messiah; it was not an elected office, and their choices did not change this fact, did not prevent his triumphant death or his resurrection. Many Jews did believe in him, many more did not.
 Hope this helps. I'll have to look another time at whether or how any of this should affect the article, as I'm obviously coming in very late to an old discussion.  17:15 Sep 9, 2002 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I have totally added that movie to my Netflix queue. - (talk · contribs) 

Wish I could provide more feedback than that, the memory of the film has been washed from my mind.  I do remember the shawarma though, a very tasty shawarma indeed.  My tastes run more towards teenage sweedish lesbians and boy meets girl, boy beats girl.  Incidentally, I love the poster on the latter page, so perhaps I lack the moral authority to criticize Creepy Crawler.

Secretary was a fantastic movie.  I've not seen Fucking Åmål, but I think I shall.  Shawarma is OK, but I've always been more partial to a nice lamb kafta sandwich with tahini and pickles or Shanklish, olive oil, mint, and cucumber on pita. talk 
My girlfriend has an insane aversion to garlic so I rarely get to indulge in Middle-Eastern cuisine.  I've considered leaving her over this matter, but who would pay her half of the rent? It's a tough decision, garlic versus rent, one that I take very seriously.  FA was really just a very conventional teen romance movie, but with lesbians instead of heterosexuals.  Think The Breakfast Club, but with two characters, both with breasts.  Secretary was instrumental in helping me realize that James Spader wasn't a douche, though I wouldn't go out of my way to see any of his movies past or present.   
Indeed.  I used to live very close to the ByTowne Cinema in Ottawa, which contributed towards my excellent taste.  Now I live much further away and sadly the last movie I watched was Blades of Glory.  I was drunk at the time.  Now I'm sober, and filled with shame.

I would agree that it's inappropriate for Editor """"A"""" to insert a format that Editor """"A""""  ‘’knows’’ is non-standard,  and then request a consensus before it's overturned by Editor """"B"""" as soon after the posting as is reasonably practicable,” or at least provide some explanation for using this non-standard format. 

We presumably disagree as to whether, in the subject instance, Editor """"A"""" knew, or even suspected, the information (the year of death for the author who had just died that week) which Editor """"A"""" added to the article, was in a non-standard format. So then, if that were the case as to Editor """"A"""", I think then that Editor """"B"""" should obtain a consensus before changing (or deleting in its entirety) the information added by Editor """"A"""" in a format that Editor """"B,"""" acting alone without a consensus, believes in good faith to be a non-standard format. I think that except in the very rare case where there can be no reasonable belief that Editor """"A"""" was acting with a good faith belief that he was adding to the article, but rather, he was vandalizing it, should Editor “B” proceed to delete or edit the work of Editor “A” without first obtaining a consensus, or at the very least, to receive a (favorable) response to his request to Editor “A” that there be a change.

I believe that a procedure like this is in compliance with “assuming good faith”, which as you know is a fundamental principle on Wikipedia: It is this assumption that (other) editors' edits and comments are made in good faith. [Wikipedia:Assume good faith] that, I think, is what is missing in the approach taken by Editor “B.” That is, that Editor “B” should have approached the work (the newly added/inserted information) of Editor “A” with the assumption that we are all supposed to be operating under at all times, that Editor “A’s” additions/deletions/revisions/etc. were made in good faith, and that being the assumption, it cannot be appropriate for Editor “B” to single-handedly and without a consensus, delete all (or even part) of Editor’s “A” work. Does that strike you as an outrageous proposition? I mean, presumably Editor “A” and “B” share common flaws of imperfection found in so many humans, and presumably, going into the issue without any knowledge of the other editor, neither editor can presume that he is absolutely correct in every aspect and that anyone who views anything differently than he is a vandal intent on destroying Wikipedia. 

Isn’t it at the outset basically a 50/50 proposition when an editor goes, to delete the newly added information by another editor, that he may be wrong in making that deletion? And if it’s 50/50, shouldn’t he ask for a consensus before deleting the work of another editor, or at a bare minimum contact the other editor and have some reasonable assurance that Editor """"A"""" has received his note/email/posting/etc. before deleting Editor “’A’s” work?

I might comment that in our situation, it was not an instance of Editor “A” changing something that was already on the page and then Editor “B,” seeing what was obviously an act of vandalism in the changes by editor “A,” reverting those changes. Not at all. Editor “A” added new information (the year of death for an author who had just died), and Editor “B,” believing that it was presented in a non-standard format to have this information at that particular place, deleted it. Editor “B” believed that this date information belonged, if anywhere, only on a page devoted to the author himself, and nowhere on a page the subject of which was the author’s work, in this instance, a book.

I do in fact disagree with Editor “B” on that point. I find it very useful to see when, during an author’s lifetime, and also in relation to significant world events, an author or artist wrote or published or created a particular piece of work, Articles about the book, or other work, when discussing the writing and publishing, virtually always includes references to when he wrote the book or when he had it published and even references to when other drafts of the book were created (like Herman Melville losing the first finalized version of Moby Dick at sea and having to re-write the entire book years later, or other such interesting facts, like authors commenting that they would have changed many things in a book if they had written it after a particular event in their lives personal to them (e.g., the death of a beloved father, birth of their own child, marriage, good or bad fortunes, etc.) or events in their lives in which we collectively share in some part (the 9/11 attacks, sinking of the Titanic, WWII, War in Vietnam, the shooting of Ronald Regan/Kennedy/Kennedy/King/VJ day, VE day/man walking on the moon/the falling of the Berlin Wall, or the deaths of Roosevelt’s, Churchhill, Elvis, John Lenon,",0,0,0,0,0,0

When you think about its pretty funny and sad at the same time. Azerbaycan is such a small country these days, and yet its influences go all arround the middle east. Everyone debates who Azeri really are and were did they come from. The truth is Azerbaycan are the descendants of the Medes. The Medes was a independant Empire that was as large as Iran of today. They made a huge impact on the world, they changed the perspective of the world as it is today. 
I know Persians say Azeri are Iranians and Turks say Azeri are Turkish. But the truth is Azeri are a independant people with a combination of the two nations. Medes merged into Persia, the first Persian King was Cyprus and he was half Azeri! After the Persians the Turks took over. We learned they culture and language and still use it today. Today Azeri are more closer to Turks then to Persian, in fact we Azeri pretty much hate Persians. They changed our great history, they say Azeri dont even excist, what kinda nonsense is this? I'll tell you why, becayse of the 66 million people living in Iran today, 28 million of them are Azeri. But the Iran goverment dont like to call them Azeri, instead they are called Turkic. Anyways whole north of Iran belong to Azerbaycan in reality, thats why Iran and Azerbaycan arent friends but more enemies.

FyzixFighter, you are making some of the same mistakes as Brews. You seem to think that we can take that four part expansion of acceleration in terms of polar coordinates and read some physics into it. We can't. The polar terms tell us nothing about any particular motion.

But they are nevertheless very useful. We can use the expressions in a properly modelled differential equation that involves real physical input. The radial convective term is used as a centrifugal force in the two body gravity problem.

You seem to think that because it is derived with a negative sign that it has to mean centripetal force. That is not so. The negative sign is a consequence of the outward positive convention for the position vector.

The expression is merely the mathematical form for a force that changes the direction of motion and acts in the radial direction.

When we construct the planetary orbital equation, we end up with a radial gravity force inwards and a centrifugal force radially outwards. We have a scalar equation in the radial length and the two forces equate to the second time derivative of the radial length. You have got too much bogged down in trivia over matters like whether or not the second time derivative of radial length is entitled to be termed radial acceleration or not.

It doesn't matter. Just concentrate on the equation and solve it. And in doing so, you will see that inward radial gravity is working in opposition to an ongoing outward radial centrifugal force.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I deleted the study by Liljegren and Ekberg although it is a well-done and interesting study. I deleted it because the research conducted did not directly concern occupational stress. The research concerned turnover intentions, turnover itself, and burnout. For example, Liljegren and Ekberg found that burnout was correlated with turnover intentions, and that people who changed their jobs lowered their scores on the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory. Occupational stressors were not measured. Clearly the study could be mentioned in the Wikipedia article on burnout.",0,0,0,0,0,0

response to your nasty personal attacks, Blockader and Blah
'You people are unbelievable in your ignorance and the ease to which you get brainwashed by subversive propaganda.
 Learn to read. I said that Paine and Jefferson came up with the ideas for a minarchist government whereby the freedom and equality of the people would  be protected. Have you read Paine and Jefferson? You are attacking the wrong men. If you want to rightfully attack an American forefather attack Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, and others.
 I never said they were anarchists. I do say, though that Jefferson expressed his admiration for anarchism. If he had suggested it at a congressional meeting he probably would have been shot or lynched or they just would have impeached him. (Something that many of them wanted to do anyway.)
 Being patriotic to your country and anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Sounds like you have been reading too much Communist propaganda. Communists just love to subvert governments and China is trying to subvert this one right now. I personally would love to overthrow the fascist-socialist state we're in right now and get back our freedom. But Maoism is not something I would have in mind in the way of freedom.
 Blah and Bockade, since you think you know the ideologies that are best for me, let me find one for you. Hmm, maybe subverting your current government into a dictatorshiptotalitarian state would be appropriate. Or perhaps, as you are incapable of reading comprehension or the most rudimentary thought, working in a convenience store, rather than editing what used to be an encyclopedia would be a good idea for you. Or maybe, how about going and fucking yourself. Now, after having  baited me with your ignorant and idiotic comments, go running to the admins and report me for PAing you, thereby proving beyond any shadow of a doubt how unanarchistic yet socialistic you really are.

Apparantly, Aaron this article is the way you'' want it to be, just to get some accuracy into your last comment.

Let's see, accusations of parroting, arbitrary classification of users based upon pen-name preferences, straw-men, ignoratio elenchi, and finally begging the question through the same fallacious reasoning as previously. We call that petitio principii, don't we? Apparently nothing will change his mind until I change my pen-name to something like John Doe. How does he know that I am not this Russian dude who likes Iranian history and culture? Oh, that's right, he doesn't. He probably didn't check my IP-address to see that I'm based in Sweden and could in fact be a Swede. Whoops... Sounds like our neutralist is using a subtle profiling method to his convenience.

Like I stated before, it doesn't matter if I'm a Nazi, Communist, Liberal or even a hippie. It doesn't matter if I do drugs, or if I look even remotely like a reptile. It doesn't matter if I'm even an obese Tongan kid. It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument, and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation. This is aptly called speculation.

Now, I will only say two things. First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion: Livius.org is visited by thousands of people daily. Along with a number of other scholar-related websites, I can't live without checking it by a daily basis. It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!

Second point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.

try these important things and maybe you won't be such a sucker motherfucker:

1. Learn how to spell. If things remain as they are, everyone is bound to consider you to be the ignorant lame-brained cult member you are.

2. Revert your attacks on Van Tucky on the talk pages. You come off as a vicious, vile psychopath. If you ever set your cult defending ass in a court of law, the jury would see through your charade in heartbeat.

3. Stop playing good cop- bad cop with your fucking retarded Dahn hack Forestgarden

4. Accept all Korean language sources you stupid bitch!! How dare you try to stifle and censor articles in the name of your fucked up cult. Your Forestgarden bitch believes its within Wiki policy to include Korean language articles when reporting on favorable aspects of your bitch master. Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?

5. Stop using the word cynical to describe your """"enemies."""" You come off even more retarded than your Ilchee bitch master. Your philosophical maturity is less than that of a first grader. The world is """"cynical."""" Those who don't believe in Dahn are """"cynical."""" I can't wait until South Park makes an episode about your bitch cult. 

6. Are you fucking insane? Korea is the center of the universe? Korea as a cultural hub? Korea the place where the next messiah appears? You Dahn people never cease to amaze when it comes to your thought processes. Korea is not what your Ilchee bitch believes it to be. Think about it retard- the fucking nation of Palau has more of a right to talk about religious heritage than the fucking hermit kingdom. How can you be so retarded, that you choose a Korean cult?

Coming to Korea and joining a Korean cult with Korea-centric views is more retarded than travelling to Antartica in search of good coffee while visiting Columbia in search of ice and snow.

7. One more time: the philosophical underpinnings of your shit cult are so flimsy I must question your intelligence.

8. Nicola Cola...what kind of bitch ass name is that? what is wrong with you?

Oh wow, I take a little drive and come back to a nuclear war zone? I guess I can take on each point...

 The fact that MF was not blocked for the same behavior is rather odd (also... if you ask a question after telling me to stop replying... what do you really expect?).
 I agree that Tan needed to be blocked and I agree with the desysopping. 
 To say that I have no right to be angry is a foolhardy notion. I was told multiple times to fuck off (btw, when told to fuck off, I am considerably less likely to comply).
 . They both hail from the infamous Tiscali network. That being said, rpeh has no reason to be involved in this discussion (he has a personal issue with me ever since he was desysopped on another wiki; he hasn't gotten over it). I intend to request a checkuser and request a block for sockpuppetry.
 User:Georgewilliamherbert places too much weight on unofficial warnings. A vandal can be warned four times but a user once? Hmmmm...
 Prodego has no reason to be desysopped. He had every right to block for a violation of WP:NPA tens of times.

This is a message to Jenny,

What the fuck do you think this is, some place where you can just waltz in unannounced and be received with arms wide open? WELL FUCK THAT! This is motherfucking Wikipedia, bitch. WE call the shots. WE ALWAYS get shotgun. WE don't give a fuck who you are, because WE are infinitely more important than you. WE are always first in line. WE always fuck the hot chick before she gets acne and settles for you. WE rob banks, charities, and ANYONE else who fucking pisses us off. This place is more than just a place, faggot, it is an IDEOLOGY. And this ideology says you need to GET THE FUCK OUT. 

No one here will ever like you. WE have already established cliques, slop-worthy-hoes, and prop-worthy-bros, GOT IT? WE are the ideology of elitism, exploitation, and lulz. This isn't a fucking game, kid, so don't try to tag along. You're talking to people who have been around the block AND THEN SOME. WE pioneered class. WE made 'cool' cool. And you? What have you done? Jerked off in the shower? WE INVENTED JERKING OFF IN THE SHOWER, you stupid bitch. There is a clear-cut, defined, infinitely thick WALL between you and us. WE built the wall that keeps you fags OUT. So don't try to act like you know what the fuck is going on, because you don't. You just do NOT. 

But you really think you can compete with the Review? LOL WOW Don't make me start flaming you. Are you forgetting who we are? WE are the ones who film people like you getting fucking destroyed by us. WE will rip your ASSHOLE out of your fucking rectum, STITCH IT on top of your pitiful dick hole, and then fuck you in the VAGINA we just made for you. SO WE MAKE YOU INTO A BITCH. Do you get it now? This site isn't a game, it isn't a place to 'chill' with your fags, and it isn't some fucking haven where people like you can get acceptance from people like US. IT ISN'T GOING TO HAPPEN.

In my own defense: A man has a right to his opinion. I do feel Timothy Usher is a bigot. I do feel that Jews are screwing up the planet (though admittedly Muslims, by far, surpass the Jews in their capacity to destroy things). Look at history. Only recently has it become the norm to like Jews. That only came about after certain countries (eg America) adopted them as the collective dame-in-distress needing shelter and protection. Sort of the precursor to the chihuahua. Before then, Jews were hated in Europe and America alike..And everywhere else. We all know Jews were once banished from most culturally superior European countries. The only reason why Poland took them in was that they had loads of money. Probably the same reason why Washington panders to the now. Point is, alot of people dislike Jews. I'm entitled to, so long as I don't demonstrate that dislike on articles dealing with the topic of Jews. We don't penalize people for not liking things, do we? His Excellency... 

So how about dealing with things like that. PS this user is not perminently banned!",0,0,0,0,0,1

 Apology to Jeremy 

Hi Jeremy,
Recently I made some rather derogatory remarks referring explicity to your homosexuality, sexual activity with those of the same gender, your race, the objects that you may or may not insert into your bodily cavity, and your inability to perform the act of fellatio at a satisfactory level. I also made some comments demanding that you orally consume my feces, and then perform fellatio, at an unsatisfactory level, to even myself. The list continues, of course, on and on and on. I also failed ot cite any source giving proof of your behaviour, and for that I am ashamed. 
So I am extending my apology to you for my explicit and coarse language, and next time I have any conflcit with you, I will definitely go abuot it in a more productive manner. I will not call you demeaning names like """"faggot, nigger, kike, cocksucker, faggot, asshole, son fo a bitch, faggot, motherfucker etc"""".
I am sincerely embarassed of my behaviour, and after reflecting I know the inappropriateness of it all. Please accept my apology, and know that whatever your lifestyle, I did not mean for my comments to be taken personally.
Sincerely,
Michelle Rollins""",1,0,0,0,0,0

What a pile of shit. You completely ignore a massive violation of WB:BLPCRIME while you go on holiday. You, Wales, are one special piece of shit.

Purrum, look in the mirror mate because you're full of self-righteous opinions, views, hypotheticals, allegations, accusations, hearsay and fabricated information on Ronald Ryan. And, you have the ordacity to express them on Wikipedia! 
Tell us Purrum, why don't you also request deletion of every published """"hateful"""" opinions by Hodson, that have appeared in various media articles over the decades, for everybody to read? Common sense suggests that if Hodson demands her opinions on Ryan be published on the media, then it becomes relevant referenced material for Wikipedia. If Hodson doesn't want her opinions to be made public information, then she should keep her vile mouth shut. Therefore, I will continue to add every referenced article regarding Ryan on Wikipedia, for the purposes of fully informing and educating the public.
It's obvious that Purrum passes judgement on what referenced articles should be banned, deleted, sensored and replaced with lies - nothing but lies!

Whatever. You're an stupid redneck hillbilly who is too uneducated to understand the most basic axioms of logic (defensive gun use cannot occur more than 100 percent of the time.) you're also a liar, since it doesn't say 33 million. The article says 1 million. Enjoy your fraudulent encyclopedia, you intellectual fraud. i hope you enjoy mastrbating to your gun collection at night and your middle school education which thinks it's possible for there to have been 33 million gun uses. It's not even logically possible for there to have been a million, but you have zero intellectual honesty or integrity and you might be the single dumbest two individuals I have ever met. Wikipedia is truly the last refuge for idiots who failed out of their formal education and cannot understand the most basic elements of logical argument.
