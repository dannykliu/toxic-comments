 Some things to note about Stalin 

1., Many and most photos of Stalin are either heavily doctored or even fake. He was known to aviod photographers because his face was ugly from heavy pitting and canker. He had a number of better-looking doubles (stand-ins) to serve in PR opportunities. He used to stand on high/remote pedestrals when must appear in public to avoid close scrunity.

2., It is a commonly held opinion in Eastern Europe (I think it is a fact) that Josif Dsugasvili was an ordinary highwayman by profession before he joined the revolutionaries. He used to rob trains with a grops of outlaws, forcing people to stand and deliver.

3., Isn't it strange the Stalin Wikipedia article does not include the word dictator / dictatorship (or anything that starts with dict*) at all according to IE's search? Political correctness should not run amok, especially considering this is english language Wikipedia and US people know very little about foreign relations and history by school education, so it is easy to indoctrinate them by """"kind ol' Uncle Joe"""" babble. Or do you think only ancient roman leaders can be called a """"dictator"""" per definitionem? Most of Stalin's actions were clearly outside the realm of politics (which means debate and negotiations vs. headshot) so calling him a politician is an offense to leaders who spent their entire life serving their nation and all of its citizens in accordance with the people's will.

4., Did Stalin murder his wife? Has this issue been settled conclusively?

5., Hungarian people depicted while expressing their most sincere sentiments towards dead Stalin by toppling and decorating his giant statue in Budapest during the 1956 revolution:

 Tort Hypothetical 

The tort hypothetical needs one adjustment, I think. Scenario Three reads:

""""If a cause of action does not exist, and the damage equals $100 while the cost of the wall equals $50, the wall will exist. Even though #2 cannot win the lawsuit, he or she will still pay #1 some amount between $51 and $99 to build the wall.""""

This doesn't seem correct. If a cause of action does not exist, #2 cannot shift the $100 cost onto #1, so #2 is faced with two options: incur the $100 damage or pay a lower amount to avoid that damage (by constructing a wall or having a wall constructed). The utility-maximizing choice would be to pay $50 to build the wall herself. She wouldn't pay more than that to have #1 build the wall.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The Church of England (today know as Church of England, Anglican Churhc, Episcopalian (in the USA, and Scotland) was thus created in 1534.  Since Henry was of Welsh blood, he took power over both England and Wales in Personal Union.  Henry confiscated all Roman Catholic Church Lands (well 90%) in England and Wales, and transfered them to the Church of England.

In 1536, the Act of Union of 1536, formal merged the Parliamentary Powers of England and Wales, whose seat of parliament is todays British House of Commons.

Notice to vandalizing halfwits, linkspammers, and people who don't read WP:NOT

Before you sit down and construct a series of vandalizations to this page, or whine about the article I put a CSD tag on, or my AfD vote, you should be informed that your world orbits a ball of fire. This ball of deadly heat is paradoxically far enough away that it actually provides some level of benefit to those who spend a measured amount of time in front of it. While you should not in any way stare at it, a respectful glance in its direction will show you that it is warm and in some ways healthy. 

Accompanying the ball of fire is a collection of variant photosensitive lifeforms and constantly recycled breathing material, suitable for your use at any time you so please, and containing life-giving elements. As an added bonus, most of these materials are available to you entirely for free and 24 hours a day. 

We encourage you to cease vandalizing or whining on this page and get to know the magic ball of fire.

Credit to User:Elaragirl for the above

Disclaimer: The above is intended as a humorous way to emphasize a point. If you are not humorous, feel free to continue to be a halfwit or linkspammer, or both if you prefer. You may also ignore the fiery ball, if you so please, however I warn you that without it, you would never have been permitted to enjoy linkspamming or halfwittedness or ignorance of WP:NOT.

cc8da30eed0be624,"Abuse of 'authority' 
Not to burst your petty little power trip, but it isn't exactly fair game to ban someone just because he was right and you were proven wrong. When someone accuses another of being an 'anti-semite' just because the ADL has labelled him as such, I want to point out to to the Wikipedia audience that however horrible it may be, 'anti-semitism' actually originated from the United States, not Nazi-Germany, though it later adopted it from the likes of Madison Grant and Charles Davenport. Wikipedia's own article on Henry Ford states as much, yet when I bring it up in a Talk section, I get accused by the likes of you for vandalism and banned.

It is the sheer height of hypocrisy that you can go around calling people like me a 'crank' and 'conspiracy theorist', yet I get BANNED by you just because I call you a 'deceptive little creature', which you clearly have demonstrated you are. You can CALL ME all sorts of names, yet I in return am not allowed that privilege. You are deliberately colluding with THF and Collect (two other sockpuppets on Prescott Bush's page) to get rid of as much 'inconvenient' information as possible. Perhaps it's just because you're really clueless and really don't know alot - that would be at least the half-way respectable scenario, and the least weighing on your conscience.

You want your audience (who I presume you want to delude, that is, unless you really DID NOT KNOW Henry Ford published The Elders Of Zion) to remain in a paradigm - without ever knowing where anti-semitism originated from and what a joke it is to see the ones who PROMOTED the concept of 'racial purity' and 'Aryan superiority' to Hitler to remain free of persecution. You use that 'ploy', that 'slogan', 'anti-semite', 'crank', as a silencing technique. It's a deceptive con-game, especially when you never get at the heart of the matter - where the anti-semitism came from, who started the ball rolling, and hey, guess what? The source of origin is a very unlikely one, and very unfortunate and inconvenient indeed for the self-righteous Americans always eager to trot out charges of 'anti-semitism'.

Unfortunately for you, and your sources, Prescott Bush's collusion with the Nazis is a well-established fact, and is well-documented in numerous high-profile books on the subject, including Trading With The Enemy: An Expose of the Nazi-American Money Plot. What you have constructed thus far are 'strawmen' arguments and falling back on 'guilt by association'. You peddle establishment sources as the ultimate harbinger of truth, perhaps KNOWING or NOT KNOWING the complete collusion of mainstream news with the establishment. More unfortunate for you, still, is that President Calvin Coolidge, Woodrow Wilson, Margaret Sanger, the father of JFK and countless other Americans clearly believed in the Nordic/Aryan races' superiority and viewed the Nazis as good. Worse still is that FDR refused to take Jewish refugees from Nazi-Germany. Even worse, university professors were making statements in 1936 to the tune of 'Hitler is beating us at our own game - race hygiene and sterilization'. This is all documented in books such as Edwin Black's 'War Against The Weak' - and don't come with your silly, puny little slogan such as 'conspiracy theorist' just because you don't care and don't want to know.

Unlike you and your petty insults and one-liners, I can back up all these claims with facts and more. I can only conclude that you're a weak-minded yuppie who really does not CARE about the facts, but whether or not you can hang out with your equally deceptive Wikipedians, gain some 'street' credits and keep people in a deceitful paradigm while slandering people who want to break out of your make-believe reality. And of course, being an American, you want to uphold this concocted, grand noble myth that you're the good guys and you fought Nazism. I can only tell you haven't looked into the eugenics history of your own country, or the Royal Institute of Intl. Affairs Conference of 1938. You didn't read Edwin Black's War Against The Weak, haven't you? You haven't read Eugenics And Other Evils by Chesterton, huh?

We live in the information age, sonny. Ignorance is no veil to hide behind - and neither are petty and childish retorts like 'crank', 'anti-semite' or 'conspiracy theorists'. So lose that beard of yours and that smug grin (BTW, not to hurt your ego, but you don't look all that great), quit being so gullible, because I have a newsflash for you, if you keep sticking your head in the sand, you're gonna get hurt real bad too, bubba - by your own masters. The only thing you're doing is discrediting Wikipedia even further by engaging in clear deception.

Comments

I liked it.  Rare is an article which is not only well documented but also interesting.  

I'm a stickler for comma use, so I went ahead and fixed three small errant commas in the article.

As to content, I would raise only two points.  At note 64, you say something like this: """"There was an attempt to assassinate the king.""""  Rather than saying """"There was . . .,"""" I think a better phrasing would be to use the actor as the subject and an action verb.  That is, """"A group of landowners attempted to kill the king.""""  Is it known who was behind the attempt?  

Second, I see that some other people have commented about one-sentence paragraphs.  I wonder if a correction of that did not produce the paragraph at note 71.  that paragraph begins with the topic sentence saying that brewing was becoming popular in the area.  Then, the whole rest of the paragraph has to do with witch trials.  Were those things linked in some way?  Perhaps cut the first sentence free again and add a follow up line about the volumes of beer that were being brewed or something.

I hope these comments are not too pedantic.  I'm new to peer reviewing anything.  Also, I am totally in the dark about formatting for notes, so I've not even attempted to weigh in on those.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

90e0a235104be6e1,"Invitation to workshops on Wikipedia editing
Dear Ploversegg,

We are a team of researchers at the University of Oxford and AU Sharjah, researching the experiences of editors of content about the Arab world on Wikipedia. We are interested in your experiences of editing Wikipedia and are organising two events that we think you would be an excellent contributor to.

First, starting next week on Monday 27th August, we are hosting an online discussion about what it is like to contribute to Wikipedia in Arabic and to articles about the Middle East and North Africa. We are interested in what barriers you perceive to exist in Wikipedia, how articles can be made better and generally what can be done to expand and improve Arabic Wikipedia. This discussion will take place on a MediaWiki hosted at our institution and be available in English and Arabic. We will allow users to create their own discussion pages in addition to our discussions.

Second, we are hosting face-to-face workshops in Cairo from 21st-22nd October 2012. If you are interested in this we may be able to pay your travel and accommodation costs depending on where you live. This workshop will cover similar themes to the online discussion but will allow participants to meet one another and benefit from being together.  

We will take care of the organization and planning and all you have to do is show up and be ready to discuss. But if you would like to help shape some of the discussion themes in advance, please let us know. We have booked time in the workshops for Wikipedian-led discussions.  

More details can be found in our “Frequently Asked Questions” section below. 

We would be delighted to welcome you to either (or both) event. Please let me know (wikiproject@oii.ox.ac.uk) if you would like to participate and we can send you more details.

Sincerely,

Frequently Asked Questions:
 
What is the purpose of this project?

This project is about who represents the Arab World on Wikipedia, and how the Middle East and the Arab world is represented on Wikipedia. We are studying Wikipedia through statistics, edit  history data and personal experiences. Our ultimate goal is to help Wikipedia grow in size and fairness and do academic research on this topic. You can read more about the project here: http://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/research/projects/?id=70 From this page, you can also find a biography of the researchers. You may also want to see our interactive visualizations about Wikipedia here: http://wikiproject.oii.ox.ac.uk/ 

Who is funding this project?

This project is funded by the International Development Research Centre (http://www.idrc.ca). This organization is funded by the Canadian government to improve infrastructure across the world, including online content. We have been working with the IDRC since June 2010. 

Why did you contact me?

Because you’re awesome. In all seriousness, we have been looking through Wikipedia for active editors based on user activity in either Arabic Wikipedia or articles about the Arab world. We have not contacted everyone we could, but we contact people that we think will help to balance the discussion and help us (and each other) learn more about the state of Wikipedia.  

Do I need to participate in both events?

Not at all. You are welcome to participate in both or just one. We recognise that it will be more convenient for some people to have online conversations and for others to speak in person. For some people it will not be practical to fly to the Middle East, but we still consider their contributions important and want to give them a voice in this work.

Can I use my Wikipedia handle in the online discussion?

You do not need to use any particular name on the online forum. All we need is a valid email address so you can register. You can post using your real name, your Wikipedia name or a completely different nickname, whatever allows you to speak your mind most effectively. 

What sort of travel funding will you supply for the face-to-face workshop?

We have funding for travel and accommodation costs for approximately twenty participants depending on where they are coming from. If you would like to join us in one of the face-to-face meetings then we wi",0,0,0,0,0,0

Discussion of the involvement of the Bielski group with other partisan groups in reallife belong on the article with the group. Wikipedia has an obligation to document the controversy, including of course the statements of supporters of the group as prominently as critics of it.

 Trivia lesson  

Ok, I’m going to enjoy this… Here we go, amateur. You can reply where I indicated between paregraph so that the disscusion can be more organized:

1. Rupert Thorne was a recurring villain in a Kingpin fashion from the 2nd half of the 70's until the Crisis came. Then he was forgotten and then saved by Timm in the 90's for the animated series. Falcone is just a recurring name Frank Miller and Jeph Loeb use when he needs to mention Gotham City mafia. Carmine, was never a lead villain like Rupert has been. If you accuse me of just watching the animated series (which I deny) I can acuse you of just getting exited because of the Carmine appearance in the last movie. Maroni is just a support guy for Two-Face's story, as Tony Zucco is for Robin's (who is the nerd defending minor characters and bragging about how he knows nick names everybody knows, like """"Boss"""" and """"roman"""" , now? heh, heh, heh)

Reply:

2. every single comment can be sourced. Appealing to whom, for example is the easiest comment to source if you want to waste your time like that. Just check how many batman titles are published every single month and how many people buys against any other superhero's books. You will learn that monthly, the amount of baman books sold is good enough to call the mythos appealing. That's why there are 6 motion pictures, 2 animated series (without jl and superfriends and even scooby-doo appearances by joker, riddler, scarecrow and penguin) and, live action show and several internet about batman, his foes and his mythos. That's why the mythos is so appealing.

Reply:

3. Catwoman is dangerous. Following your logic maybe mr zsasz would be batman's worst enemy. Being a killer doesn’t make an enemy notable as his protagonism and his importance in the mind of Batman and Batman readers, writers and creators does. Knowing Batman's identity and not being completely on the good side makes her even more important. You seem new to the comics’ world, do you really think Catwoman is going to be Holly for so long? Context, PC, context. Selina has been a main character for more than 60 years, I’m talking about all those years. Not about the comic book you just bought on the corner store last week, my """"mate"""". Following again your line of thought, it not worth saying Nixon was a president because he is dead. We couldn’t say Adam West was Batman because that show is of. And you called my ways childish…

Reply:

4. I think you might be confused. We are talking about Batman. You might be thinking of some other superhero. In batman comics bets are that, if you buy a batman comic from any year at random, or watch any episode form any batman series, also at random, The Joker, Catwoman, the Penguin, the Riddler or Two-face are going to be the main villain. If you get the croc, or scar-face, the mad-hatter you are loki, and if you catch you hero the """"Roman"""" you are really, really a lottery winner. By the way there it’s something called figurative speech, and it means to compare situations, I dunno if they told you. They are not literary on a race.

Reply:

5. Hugo, the Scarecrow and the Hatter are influential because, whenever they appear, the story goes on a deeper lever exploring Batman's mind and messing with it. Those characters are useful tools when a writer wants to analyze Batman. Besides, I don't know if you are capable of using your imagination, I’m sure you can, it’s an indispensable tool for getting into the story when you read, but if someone messes with your mind on the level they have messed with Batman’s , that'll probably leave some ugly emotional scars on you... good thing he is the Batman. Therefore, they do get to be influential in a way. Thinking they don't get to appear as much as the five previous, therefore they are not influential is just wrong

Here, from the talk page, three other editors confirming my judgment of just how """"embarassing"""" the current article is, and which contributes to the common conception among academics that Wikipedia is primarily written by intellectually disabled kindergartners and high-school dropouts on a power-trip: 
'm sorry but the introduction is an embarrassingly crass articulation of what Heidegger's project is about. It is embarrassing and needs to be fixed!

I agree, especially with sources. From what I understand of Heidegger, the three paragraphs in the introduction are roughly accurate, but they require edits to become smooth and easily understandable. But most importantly, there are no references!! I find the biography and following subjects are for the most part thoroughly cited, but the intro is not? I will keep my eye out for references, but anyone who is knowledgable and wellread on the subject should consider adding references to the introduction. Jdanbeck (talk) 
I'd say the second paragraph is inaccurate, and in fact absolute nonsense. It neither reflects Heidegger's position, nor is coherent in itself. There used to be a decent intro. Revert to it? KD Tries Again (talk) KD Tries Again

And then, have a look at the fact that 4 editors supported me, before a single WIKILAWYER arrived at the scene, to mass delete. How exactly can I """"lose"""" an argument about Heidegger by calling you Hitler? Whether or not you or I or anyone is an idiot or a Nazi or whatever has no reflection on whether or not the current article ACTIVELY SPREADS MISINFORMATION, as I have repeatedly stated and showed.

 Wrong date? 
""""In Europe"""" states Pandora's Box is from 1928, """"Filmography"""" states it's from 1929. Which one is correct?

 The authoritative Louise Brooks Society lists it as 1929.  The movie was still be filmed when Brooks turned 22; there's a picture of cast & crew celebrating it on the London attic set.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 71.192.5.55   

 Philosophy 
I remember reading in one news article about this individual, it was brief and cryptic, concerning pessimistic aesthetics philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer.
There seems an unnerving concentration on the film persona (particularly with the one from """"Box"""", which I do not think is the best image to dwell on, given that it is one of dehumanization and objectification for varyous fetishistic obsessive types). I have a strong intuition that there was infact ALLOT more to this person then what is being focused on by what appears to be a majority of her fans. Is there any further detail in any of the Seven Seals concerning her philosophy, ideology, and maybe even politics (and at best, religion)? Given her scholarly nature, I strongly doubt any real resemblance to the character of that film. Seek the Forms  

 Tone? 
Hi all, glad to read this article, & I think Louise Brooks is way cool, but I have a quibble:  Here & there, it tends to read like a fansite (i.e., a bit gushy) instead of an encyclopedia article.  Does anyone else have this impression?  I think a few word changes might help.  I can take a shot at it.  

 Oh yeh I have. That and the fact that there is a marked lack of any of her philosophies. I see her, first and foremost, a scholar, who wrote film reviews and seven esseys (their subject is not given in this artical), or even any philisophical works (though, they may have been very, very diluted, given that Shopenhauer was a major influence on her, he held a nihilistic perversion of Neo-Platonism that would lead to social anarchy, followed by dictatorship by the Nietzscheans). I have bumped into this recently and was somewhat impressed, though, not satisfied with a lack of insight into her potentially more important contributions (if any). The secret here is, I suspect most of these people are just obsessed perverts (fans, like you said). Thanks

 JIDF posts image for Wikipedia 

Here's a situation I found intriguing. The JIDF blog specifically posted an image to put on this Wikipedia article. The heading currently reads """"Better Sample of the Groups We Target (For Wikipedia)."""" This strikes me as problematic. At the very least, it gives the appearance of Wikipedia coordinating with JIDF to promote JIDF, or cooperating with JIDF's self-promotion. (From what I can tell, our image is downloaded from the blog image by Einsteindonut 8-22-08.) I'm sorry if you've already come to consensus about the inclusion of the image in the article, but I did want to mention this interesting nuance. Best wishes,  | Talk 
I don't like the way the JIDF is manipulating this article, posting messages for Wikipedia that are then being used as sources. I wish there was some way to put an end to it, but I think a blog is a WP:RS for what it says about the organization that sponsors it. — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs) 

 Hm. That's interesting.  The JIDF is only marginally notable (only two major press citations have been found), and being in Wikipedia increases the visibility of the organization. Wikipedia usually doesn't display web site screen shots. Usually an article gets a logo, if that. Also, we have a third-party cartoon in that image without copyright clearance.  Maybe we should drop that image.      

It looks like the JIDF doesn't want to be on Wikipedia after all. — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs) 
At this juncture, Malik, their opinion about whether to be on Wikipedia strikes me as irrelevant. (I'm assuming that WP:BLP does not apply to organizations, right?) However, if the screenshot is unusual for an article of this size, then I'd be interested in hearing the pro's and con's for keeping the image. (Aside from the promotional concern I've floated above.) Tx,  | Talk 

I think there may be copyright problems, because (for example) the Hamas logo is subject to copyright. I've brought the question up at Wikipedia:Copyright problems. — Malik Shabazz (talk · contribs) 

The Anti-Defamation League, AIPAC, and CAMERA Wikipedia pages don't have screenshots. They don't even have pictures other than the logo, and those are organizations with physical offices, known officers, and big real-world events.  The page for Facebook has a picture of Facebook HQ (although, amusingly, that picture is actually of the Japanese restaurant that occupies the ground floor) and a screen shot of the home/login page.  Miniclip has a screen shot of their huge home page in their info box. LinkedIn just has a logo.  Myspace has a logo and a picture of the headquarters building. None of these Wikipedia pages have screenshots of interior web site pages. Wikipedia doesn't usually do that.    
But John, this image serves a different function. It displays the Facebook groups that were the target of JIDF activities. So it seems directly related to the notable aspect of the group's activity. Is it relevant that the screenshot is taken from the JIDF Facebook page or blog sites? After all, it could as well be an independent screenshot of the targeted group, without JIDF as the source. See what I mean?  | Talk 

Just to clarify, there was already a sample up.  I read the blog and they made a point saying that the original sample only showed anti-semitic groups and not the terrorist groups, and I wanted to learn how to add an image, so I replaced it.  I don't care if there's a photo up or not, but I do feel if there's going to be one, that it should be the most accurate",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Song move 

You gave me some good advice about moving and redirecting pages. Thank you.

Unfortunately, I made a real mess when I tried to move """"Let It Snow"""" to """"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!""""  When I did the redirect, I accidentally mistyped the title as """"Let It Snow! Let It Snoe! Let It Snow!"""" (notice the """"Snoe"""") and forgot to look before I leapt. If that wasn't bad enough, I then went to the Redirect page for """"Let It Snow"""" and, instead of leaving the misspelling alone, I changed it to redirect to """"Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!"""" (the correct spelling), thus creating that page, which did not previously exist. Thus, when I tried to change the misspelled name to the correct name, I of course got the error that the other page already exists.  

Not to mention that there were some double redirects when I looked in """"What links here,"""" which I was going to start to fix until I realized how badly I messed up the original move. (It turns out that someone had renamed the page in 2005, with no discussion, from """"Let It Snow, Let It Snow, Let It Snow"""" to """"Let It Snow,"""" a move I would have vehemently protested if I'd been hanging around here at the time.) 

I need some help to undo this. The simplest thing would be to delete the current """"redirect"""" page for the correct title and resume from there, renaming my misspelled page and then looking at the redirects again, but I can't delete pages, and I know the rules about cutting and pasting.

Alright. First to your analysis. Information darwinism is the opposition to pig-headedness. Bring me the right arguments and I will be convinced - as anyone should be. But failing to do so you cannot convince me. You cannot convince me by begging, threats, bullying, bribing and whatever else you can think of. Only the argument is what counts. What's """"right"""" is not defined by the mainstream opinion. If 2000 years ago, people largely figured slavery was the right thing, or that the earth was flat, or that violent computer games turn people into mass murderers, that doesn't make it anyhow right. The truth is not found by a demoscopic process, but instead, by an organic, darwinistic process that Information darwinism tries to understand and act in accordance with.

I do consider your thoughts on the subject flawed on a deeper level. Part of our problem to communicate is certainly because of the limitations of language. When we use words, and you understand certain words to have a different meaning than how I understand them (e.g. """"Force"""") then we can not engage in a proper dialogue without first sorting out the terminology required. So if you do find that I use a word in a different way than how you would use it, or anything else """"weird"""", request from me a definition of the term. This is purely the linguistic barrier that must be overcome.

Now to some items that I seem to have brushed over:

The data suggest rape victims suffer more psychological trauma than other victims of assault. 

What data? By what standards? Someone beaten into a bloody pulp, robbed, or whatever, may well suffer more severe psychological trauma than someone who is victim to """"rape"""" by lax standards. These are problems rooted in terminology. If you want us to waste literally weeks to figure out the truthfulness of the statement """"rape victims are off worse than regular assault victims"""" then I have to say, no thanks. Because as a categorical statement, I can tell you right away - that is false.

You claim to want rape treated simply as assault in one instance and then go and suggest it should be a special form of assault. (which it is)

It is a (special) form of assault. That does not mean it needs to be treated with different standards than other, specicific (! better terminology?) forms of assault. Assault with a gardening rake is also a special form of assault, that doesn't mean it has to be treated fundamentally different from assault with a pitchfork. Again, terminology appears to be the problem.

Having rape as a separate category of crime allows for special systems to be in place for victims and court systems.

This is not something that I have """"brushed over"""". That is what you appear to be in favor of. I disagree strongly. If someone's victim of a criminal offense, he should not be treated """"specially"""" - that is, not like other victims of criminal offenses. Otherwise you are just asking for rape victims being ridiculed by society / police / legal system while non-sexual assault victims get treated fairly. I claim that only if there is no legal difference between sexual assault and non sexual assault, that sexual assault victims (and perpetrators) can be treated fairly as everyone would wish.

Who do you actually propose giving these weapons to?

How exactly is it my job to decide who should get weapons? I would assume, similiar standards to car ownership and gun ownership should be applied. Both cars and guns are extremely dangerous in the wrong hands - lethal weapons you might say - but both serve an useful purpose: Security and Transportation. I do not think that anyone should be denied the right to own a handgun. And I certainly do not credit a state institution with the rights to decide who gets to own one and who doesnt. But what exactly are you asking me for? Elaborate the legislature of my dreams? I don't see sense in asking me that.

Well, there you have it. Basically all of the issues I have """"brushed over"""" in your mind come down to linguistic issues, terminology and the such. The answers are irrelevant as they can never be given without a ludicrous amount of detail given to the questions. I've known this - This is one of the underlying problems that you have - You fail to identify different uses of terminology and resolve them accordingly. But I would suspect that we have even deeper still disagreements on very many things than just the attitude of resolving conflicts of terminology. This is why I suspect your methodology of thinking is deeply flawed - rather than my own. And that is why I tried to tell you """"You first need to get your shit straight"""" before we can argue on actual subjects like rape legislature and social consequences thereof in a productive manner.

I have never exchanged dialogue with the primary contributor of """"Ohio Media Watch"""", but I'm pretty sure I know who that person is based on information I've found online.  If I'm right, this person has reported on him/herself more than once without disclosing his/her identity, a blatant conflict of interest in regards to reliability.  It is unfortunate that we cannot use """"Ohio Media Watch"""" on Wikipedia; however, if that blog's primary contributor is """"getting the shaft"""", blame the primary contributor.  One other thing to consider: the primary contributor at ohiomediawatch.wordpress.com has cited Wikipedia at least fifteen times, going as far back as March 2006, and as recently as January of this year.  We do not know what, if anything, the primary contributor has edited on Wikipedia — another problematic observation when weighing the reliability of """"Ohio Media Watch"""" (again, reliability as defined by Wikipedia).

I appreciate your reasoned explanation of the edits, Lucericr, but it is still troubling that Chzz chose to enforce Wikipedia's policies for personal rather than objective reasons (and please, no more inane references to WP:AGF or the like; it is perfectly obvious why Chzz felt motivated to decimate my contributions to the Soft3D page).

Something to consider, is that the references you pointed to – which are part of a larger list  are very old and are based on work done in the early years of AIDS; also, that subsequent research has not supported the same results.

The primary issue when reviewing the studies most often referenced by someone trying to link nitrites to AIDS, or more specifically to Kaposi’s sarcaoma, is that they are very weak in terms of data presented.  The results have not been repeated by other scientists.  In fact, within the list of referenced studies, there are contradictory results both by the same researcher and between different researchers.

The general consensus in the research community, and in the HIV/AIDS community, is that although the much vaunted list of references claiming to link nitrites to HIV/AIDS may look impressive to the untrained eye, they do not support a case for a claim that nitrite use causes HIV infection or Kaposi’s sarcaoma (KS).",0,0,0,0,0,0

WTF are you talking about?  There is no admin decision against me to not edit gender articles.  I'm full allowed to edit any and all articles.  Not only are you engaging in slanderous accusations, you're telling flat out lies.  I'd say spreading flat out lies which have absolutely not basis in reality against other members is a violation of several Wikipedia policies, so you better be VERY careful about what you say.  I strongly suggest that you retract your slanderous accusation before you further discredit yourself.Why the heck would I make changes under an alternate account when I have the full capability of doing it under this account?  

Also, where have I inserted any kind of right wing or religious views here?  Nothing I've said has anything to do with religion nor does it have anything to do with politics.  My points are extremely valid and you only rejected them because of your ridiculous personal biases and need to push your POV.  Not only are transvestites not necessarily transgendered, there are quite a few people on this list who are clearly NOT transvestites even using the description given in the article itself.  I have to question how anyone thought it was a good idea to add them.  

I should also note that you're being hypocritical here, you're reverting a change on the basis that it hasn't been discussed, when you yourself refuse to discuss it!  I'd be very interested to know why a) non-transgendered people should be included on a list of transgendered ones and b) why transvestite is used as automatic criteria for seeing if someone is transgendered, even though there is nothing in the definition that indicates that.

Frankly, this kind of behavior is appalling.

 Bibliography Revamp with Serialisation 

I'm proposing a revamp of the Bibliography section including the addition of a second table dealing with the serialisations of the Hornblower novels.
The serialisations were actually the first publication of all the works except the first novel so I think they deserve the space.

Currently I've put my proposed new content up at User:Jaa101/sandbox.

With the main bibliography table the main change I'm proposing is to have separate columns for the US and UK titles which are so often different.
This frees up the comments column for other information.
I've also made both the dates of publication and dates of the stories more precise.

One worry I have with both my tables is that I've linked extensively and repeatedly in them.
Normally one would link only on the first occurrence but, in this case, the tables are sortable so what's first may change.
I think it's acceptable as it is.

Finally, I've added mention of the first and most important omnibus """"Captain Hornblower"""" and also the """"Cadet Editions"""".

I propose to change the main page based on feedback.

 House chaplain 

While doing some research on U.S. Attorney General John Breckinridge, I ran across mention that his son, who was also named John Breckinridge, was a Presbyterian minister who served as Chaplain of the United States House of Representatives from 1822 to 1823. When I looked into it, I found that the subject of this article, John Brackenridge, seems to also lay claim to this title. Both were Presbyterian ministers, and both were alive and conceivably old enough to be chaplain during the period in question, but documented differences in their lives make it impossible that they are the same person. Brackenridge lived from 1772 to 1844, while Breckinridge lived from 1797 to 1841. Brackenridge was born in Pennsylvania, while Breckinridge was born at """"Cabell's Dale"""", his father's plantation in Kentucky. Brackenridge married Eleanor White, while Breckinridge was twice married, first to a Miller, then to a Babcock. Further, reliable sources have Brackenridge as chaplain of the House and Senate at different periods in time, while Breckinridge is only mentioned as chaplain in the House. Does anyone know how to sort this out? I was thinking of creating an article on John Breckinridge (the younger), which presently doesn't exist, but it would be nice to hammer this out first.

 Is OhInternet a recreation of Encyclopedia Dramatica? 

To tangent from the above topics…

Oh Internet is not Encyopedia Dramatica as the article supposes. 'Encyclopedia Dramatica' is defined as the domain name 'www.encyclopediadramatica.com' and the intellectual property concerned with ED copyright. OhInternet, however is a different project entirely; notable differences: a new XML coding system, logo and form of satire. To use terms in the article: the site was not 'overhauled' but rather 'replaced'. 

To use Silverseren's analogy, if Wikipedia did rename itself, kept most of its higher administration and stopped using Wikimedia software would it still be Wikipedia? The answer is """"No"""". The Wikipedia name and intellectual property becomes inactive, lost. If one were to charge a Wikipedia fork site with copyright violations they would have to give evidence of their ownership of Wikipedia copyright and not that of the new 'OhKnowledge.com', the hypothetical Wikipedia replacement. (Sherrod, however does have evidence, so don't take this as a justification for the .ch). Once a site loses connection with the old name or any registered associated material it ceases to be the same entity. Oh Internet has no parallels to the old site at all. The position that the new site is ED just 'cleaned' should be removed from the article immediately.

Encyclopedia Dramatica, as defined, is dead. OhInternet is a whole new project – a de facto successor, but not 'ED'. The redirect was an attempt to maintain website hits but as many 3rd party websites will show, it didn't quite work out. The vast majority of the volunteer editors did leave. Site activity, growth and edit numbers are much higher at encyopediadramaticia.ch than at OhInternet. OhInternet’s declining popularity should first stabilize before any 'notability' assessment goes underway. 

Understandably the nature of ED.ch is illegal so I don't care for it immediate coverage. I like to think the site will cool down over time.

Lede
 Per Wikipedia:Manual of Style/Lead section, the lede of this article adequately defines the Osvetnik submarine class, establishes the submarine class' necessary context, and explains why this submarine class is otherwise notable. 
 The info box for the submarine class is beautifully formatted and its content is sourced within the prose of the text and by the referenced cited therein.
 As I stated in the articles for the two Osvetnik class submarines, is there no free image of an Osvetnik class submarine for the info box? This is not a deal breaker for GA, but it would certainly add to the article's aesthetics.
 Could one more sentence be added to the lede regarding the distinguishing design features of the Osvetnik class submarines?
 The lede is otherwise well-written, consists of content that is adequately sourced and verifiable, and I have no other comments or questions for this section.

Description and construction
 I suggest starting out the first paragraph of this section by explicitly naming the Osvetnik class.
 While this is a separate matter from this article and its GA qualifications, are there plans in the works to craft an article on the Simonot design?
 Should Maschinenfabrik be spelled out either in parentheses after """"MAN"""" or with """"MAN"""" in parentheses after Maschinenfabrik?
 The section is otherwise well-written, consists of content that is adequately sourced and verifiable, and I have no other comments or questions for this section.

Service history
 I suggest adding a comma after """"On 14 September 1943.""""
 On 10 April, Osvetnik and Hrabri received orders for an operation, but operation did not proceed. Is this because they were subsequently captured by the Italian XVII Corps? If so, this should be made explicit in the prose.
 There should be a wiki-link to Scuttling in the prose for those readers not familiar with this act of deliberately sinking a ship.

I can't let that pass, as it is just so damaging - so I'm going to say a few things. You cannot just ‘summarise’ any old group of citations (sometime creating a new thing altogether in doing so - which is excempt from needing proof) – you are absolutely obliged to consider WP:weight, along with other of the many guidelines like WP:red flag in Verifiability, and Notability too. Weight alone will more often than not dictate the new text, as it has done now. 

These retentive methods of ‘Style reviewing’ are a plague across the full scope of Wikipedia, and this article highlights the foolishness (too long maintained) of methodically tick-boxing inherently illogical style-correctness, whilst routinely (ie as a kind of 'policy') ignoring content( which is ironically seen as the job of the editors, who actually get sidelined in the process). In teh past I've seen so many foolish paragraphs pass though ‘style’, even in Featured Articles (another content-shy process believe it or not). There really is nothing clever about being so clinical when it leads to plain misrepresentation, especially with a subject like this. Many non-British would will be mislead by the text on a basic ‘reader’ level here anyway, which just adds more irony to the process of course . As a rule, it is good to consider what you are doing in life in anyway, regardless of your job.

What happened in Nick Griffin is that simple event-verifying  citations from within the article (the few cases of Griffin being invited to speak at mainstream establishments) were converted into a kind of super-flexible ‘source’ material’, which (in that new state) were easily moulded into the stand-alone line """"Since he became the leader of the BNP several educational institutions have invited him to speak on political radicalism, multiculturalism, and BNP policy."""" I strongly suspect that no one got a shoe-in to actually add any weight, due to the rigid system involved - where new  content is demoted in value, and even at times discouraged. I’ve seen it happen too often, it’s just plain dumb. What’s worse, a general ethos of ‘protecting the result’ comes from the process, which ended here in me being accused of ‘vandalism’ for attempting change, which I really object to. It really is dumb.

Imagine someone collecting a handful of citations of various people expressing an opinion (shall we say of black people being inferior to whites?) and places them in a relevant section in an article (say a """"Controversy"""" section in a new and developing article called """"Racism"""") . According to Wikipedia’s Style Council, this line inserted at the end of the intro would theoretically be fine: """"Many people believe that black people are inferior to whites”. As there was nothing in the developing article about the many issues surrounding IQ test and the reading of them both past and present, no balance is made, and the Intro passes with flying colours. The new authorised version is then considered as ‘passing consensus’ – a broadly finished thing that is duly protected from change.

The Intro equation I’ve seen many times is: X (citations of comments existing somewhere i n the article) = Z (a new flexible ‘source’ material  when grouped) = Y (a new and uncited statement of fact, based on the new entity of the ‘source’). THE INNER WORKINGS OF ‘SUMMARY’ ARE SIMPLY NOT APPARENT TO THE TYPICAL WIKIPEDIA READER, who is always at the very bottom of the Wikipedia heap, just below the general editor.

Risking edit battles is far superior to squeezing down to make-shift style-approved articles that are subsequently protected from change. Here that process made the introduction bland, weak and misleading, and the added factor of the subject's inherent extremity ensured the article became seriously misleading – to the point that the article became Nick Griffin-friendly, and hence ultimate",0,0,0,0,0,0

Its continued use is still being discussed by the community, you are free to participate in such discussions. Many articles still have pending changes protection applied, however, and the ability to review pending changes continues to be of use.

Reviewers can review edits made by users who are not autoconfirmed to articles placed under level 1 pending changes and edits made by non-reviewers to level 2 pending changes protected articles (usually high traffic articles). Pending changes was applied to only a small number of articles, similarly to how semi-protection is applied but in a more controlled way for the trial. The list of articles with pending changes awaiting review is located at Special:OldReviewedPages.

For the guideline on reviewing, see Wikipedia:Reviewing. Being granted reviewer rights doesn't grant you status nor change how you can edit articles even with pending changes. The general help page on pending changes can be found here, and the general policy for the trial can be found here.

I agree with George.  The article has a significant bias.  Just because two or three editors that do nothing but patrol this page and make hundreds of posts does not mean that your interpretation of the scientific consensus' interpretation by the editors here is the same.  For those of you in academia you can read this peer reviewed study for free here - shows initial data that something remains in water long after all """"material"""" is gone.  No matter what your thoughts, unless you think the Nobel prize winner is just lying, this is pretty intriguing stuff.  He filters out all know bacteria, even to 1/5th of the size, and then takes the water and regrows the original bacteria?  With many types of bacteria?  He even notes that it must be succussed?  Whether or not it has anything to do with homeopathy doesn't change the marvel of what this first look into this new type of data holds as it is very interesting.  I chuckle to see the anonymous """"layperson"""" editors immediately discrediting nobel prize winners research because they must be a quack.  You are writing in wikipedia.  Which means, you probably don't have a real job in science or you would be doing that as opposed to sitting in the """"homeopathy"""" page in wikipedia.  

Lastly, Brunton.  You are not consensus and in general I disagree with almost all of your points and your inability to process anything but your own biased viewpoint over and over.  You need to take a rest and let other people post.  We have all heard MORE than enough from you and we clearly understand your position.  A consensus is multiple editors and you have used all of your turns and then some.  Take a break and stop trying to overpower this article just due to the fact that you are overtly biased and seem to have nothing else to do.

   Your supporting proving my point about your bias.  """"SATANLOVESGAYMEN"""" was being used as an example of where I personally finding that as a complement as I also love Satan while others may see it as an insult.  Others seeing that as an insult is their right.  I could put """"HAILSATAN666"""" as my username and i'm sure you'd probably say that's offensive too whereas I'd say that's kind of a religious motto and greeting.  What part of that (SATANLOVESGAYMEN) is """"offensive""""?  If you don't like that or interpret it a different way, you're welcome to do so.  That is kind of one of the important aspects of Satanism.  The word """"Satan"""" can go anywhere that """"GOD"""" can and shouldn't have a different reaction and if it does... not my problem.  Your note and whole argument, and actions against me are outright fallacious and simply trying to use everything i say in a manipulative and out of context manner.  As with the Fred Phelps article, placing that particular addition to his wiki was showing counter resistance to his viewpoints of hate.  So yeah, I'll be sure to see about how i challenge this further.  You don't really belong on this site as an admin if you can't see what you're doing or at least should not be reviewing any article or addition having to do with religion and in particular Satanism.  Take your Satanic_panic elsewher.  Calling my views """"trolling"""" is designed as an insult to my character and opinions and simply false.  I'm not here to necessarily go along with popular views nor be censored.  If I do something that is vandalism, yes i agree it does need to be corrected.  I did no such thing and maybe, maybe my reaction was a little overboard however yes i am new at making a lot of edits and never had such blatant and targeted censorship occur on here before.  What you did was outright biased censorship based on your lack of understanding of subjects that you obviously don't have any business of editing or should maybe check the legitimacy before hand.  What you're basically saying is my religious tenantshttp://thesatanictemple.com/about-us/tenets have no place on wikipedia such as """" The freedoms of others should be respected, including the freedom to offend. To willfully and unjustly encroach upon the freedoms of another is to forgo your own."""".  In my postings i did not make a single attack but rather placed factual additions with references.  Now you're obviously spearheading an aggressive attack trying to also go after my username i've been using for quite some time.    """"Disruptive""""...  Really... because history and text about history isn't going to be a little disruptive.  If articles have mass bias, need mass overhaul, and so on and that qualifies as """"disruptive"""" yes, i do plan on being disruptive.  However, i am learning a little more about how to use Wiki Syntax and the proper places to put arguments.  Yeah right, you're not being biased nor making an attack..... right.  Do you want to poke me in the right direction for further petition and complaint?  You'r basically having me admit i must be submissive to you who i obviously don't have much respect for and rightfully so based on your actions and displayed ignorance.

Ok, first off, let me clarify that reverting is when you undo someone else's edit (yes, it does include the re-addition of material that has been removed by another user). Your use of the word """"vandalism"""" is incorrect in this case, because everything that you have been involved in so far is classified as a """"content dispute"""", since you and your opponents have been disputing whether certain text should be included. This is not a case of vandalism (this is, for example). Secondly, many of the users that you have been reverting or the ones that have been reverting you are on the same restrictions, so IMO now everyone is equal, and no one is """"winning"""" or """"losing"""". What I've tried to explain to you is that edit wars get nothing accomplished. You keep reverting and reverting, and then someone reverts you, and the cycle continues. Wikipedia articles aren't meant to go back-and-forth like that. The only real way you get something accomplished is by discussing it with other users, in the hopes that you can form a compromise, or consensus. To answer your numbered questions:
After we last spoke you continued to revert (, , , ). On Sason, you reverted 3 times in the last 24 hours. Even though you came close to breaking the three-revert rule (which you were blocked for on May 31), three reverts is not some sort of magic barrier that prevents you from being blocked. An admin could have easily blocked you for simply edit warring. This is the type of stuff that occurred on Armenian-Azeri pages for example before the arbitration case. After that many users were placed on editing restrictions, a lot of the problems were solved. Aggressive editing can be characterized as constant edit warring, and basically a method of getting your version of the article by constant reverting as opposed to discussion. Is is the exact opposite of what is outlined at WP:1RR. Even if you believe the information you are adding is NPOV, if it is contested by several users, the best thing is to discuss it with them, and once you have come to an agreement, to implement that version. 
I'm sure you've tried to be civil, but here I notice you referring to your opponents as """"vandals"""", this is inappropriate because as I explained above, you're involved in a content dispute here. If other users have personally attacked you, please show me links of this and I will warn them. It is never acceptable to do so.
Yes, it is possible. You can get mentored at Wikipedia:Adopt-a-User. Wiki-adoption was created back in 2006 as a program designed to help new and inexperienced users.
Although you may disagree with him, it is within Namsos' right to nominate an article for deletion if he believes it is non-notable. However, as you can see from the discussion at Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Erich Feigl, it appears that many users there are deciding to keep the article, so I'm not sure that it matters anyways. Everything that you mention (awards, documentaries, books, Google hits, etc.) can be mentioned at the AfD (articles for deletion page). I have noticed that you've already made a comment there already. Make sure to keep an eye on that page, the discussion is typically open for five days.
I don't know the specifics about why your sources were removed, but if you feel like you're not getting anywhere with these disputes, you might try posting something at the Reliable Sources noticeboard if there is a dispute on whether your sources are valid or not. Another option is the new Ethnic and cultural conflicts noticeboard. Finally, after you have made all attempts at resolving the conflict (including those two links I gave you), and you still feel like nothing has been accomplished, you can check out formal mediation. There, a mediator will get involved and act as a third party.
I hope all that I have said is helpful. Please feel free to drop a note on my talk page if you have any further questions/comments. khoi """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Problems with """"Netbooks in education section"""" 

I feel like there are a couple of problems with the Netbooks in education section:

1) It doesn't seem to be written from a NPOV, and the tone is even a little advertisement-like. """"Netbooks have the potential to change the way students and teachers interact"""", """"The benefits of integrating netbooks in the classroom are many, but they are maximized when there is a 1-1 student to computer ratio"""", etc.

2) It's too long. I don't see any reason why this section should take up 1/4 of an already very long article. The """"activities"""" subsection is pure fluff. The sections on """"Effects on student learning"""", """"Costs and logistics"""", and """"Training and staff development"""", are basically fine, but they convey no information that's specific to netbooks. The information belongs in an article like E-learning.

My suggestion would be to keep the first two paragraphs of the section and chuck everything else (which is what I'll do in a day or two if there aren't any objections).   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I said it because you reverted some other minor edits as well from my revision which did not require to be reverted. Regarding the timeline, I do consider it relevant in the Mirage-based section, but within its own subsection, with a section header above, and below the text.

Anyway, I do appreciate the fact that you created it and I believe it does provide a better understanding of the subject. 

The """"Marketing"""" term does also refer to how the vehicle was commercialized in a specific market and not only to advertising or promoting. I do not see any problem with using it instead of """"Market"""", which is rather a noun than a verb in this context. It is also used in other articles as well and it seems that it is accepted.

Regarding the generation numbers, I remain to my opinion that they should be used along with years, but, at least for the moment, I will stop doing edits related to this aspect.

 Kid Buu is The Strongest Form of Buu 

Kid Buu is the strongest and the original form of Majin Buu which is clearly stated by the Supreme or East Kaioshin which ever you prefer to call him. So please stop changing it saying he's the weakest of the forms he's clearly not the weakest form he beats up Goku, Vegeta, and Majin Buu at the same time. He doesn't even get tired matter of fact he gets bored and waits for Goku to get up and starts fighting him again.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Except, you know, Kid Buu is not the strongest form of Buu. The Kaioshin stated Kid Buu is Majin Buu's original form, and he's at his most DANGEROUS like this, not the most powerful. There are many, many instances that outright prove that Super Buu and his various forms are more powerful than Kid Buu. 

Saying he beats up Goku, Vegeta and the weakest form of Majin Buu at the same time is hardly proof that Kid Buu is strongest. ANY version of Majin Buu save for possibly Fat Buu could have done that easily. In fact, Goku outright states that if he and Vegeta were to fight Super Buu while at their most powerful, they would die. Yet, when Buu reverted back to his original """"Kid Buu"""" form, they were no longer worried, and Goku KNEW he could defeat him on his own.

Hell, he and Vegeta even played rock, paper, scissors in order to decide who wiould fight him first. That's how unafraid they were. 

Look, just because you like Kid Buu best doesn't mean he's the strongest. It was stated that Kid Buu is the most unpredicatable, violent and wild of all the forms. Why isn't that good enough for you?  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 74.245.133.209   

Sorry but I don't do favortism I tell it like it is. I took he time to watch the entire Kid Buu saga and he is clearly the strongest form. If you would take the time and recall Goku begged Kid Buu to stong with his death ball attack and Kid Buu smiled because he knew Goku couldn't stop it. This just begins the fact that Goku couldn't beat Kid Buu by himself if he could have he would have turned Super Saiyan 3 and gave it his all to stop Kid Buu from blowing up the Earth. Also he even forced Goku to lose his Super Saiyan 3 transformation which caused Vegeta to step in and fight. He also caught the spirit bomb which had Gohan's, and all the other Z fighters including all the people of Earth and the Namekians. No matter how crazy you are if you can't deal with power it will overcome u which was not the case with Kid Buu he took is seriously and started pushing the bomb back. He would have succeeded if there had not been 1 wish left and Goku would have possibly been killed. So how about you watch over and over again and realize that Kid Buu is the strongest form, crazy doesn't give you the ability to beat people up it just means that you have no rationale which he doesn't have but no matter how crazy you are if you don't have the power than you can't dish it out.

As for the links to Quotes websites, they are extremely encyclopaedic, and the 1975 page has no commentary, but lists all the printed material about 1975, so as to give fair and reasonable coverage, rather than just a few selective quotes. They are all given their source, publication, date and page numbers for proof and reference. Your apparent fear and terror that the public might actually read what the Watchtower organization has written is very revealing. You clearly have an agenda to vandalize and ban free speech when it doesn't suit your agenda, not dissimilar to your religious organisation. I suggest you look inside and see why now after many months, you feel the desperate need to hide accurate, comprehensive, dated, quotes, direct and unaltered that have been published by the Watch Tower Society? If you can give all the 1975 publications from the Watchtower's website, then I'm sure many here will be only to happy to list that link, but I think you will find they refuse to give any information to the public about their less than flattering publications, and that is where we all need to see a comprehensive and fully documented source like the excellent quotes site on 1975.

Um, the Georg Blume quote obviously implies that he was inquiring about the reason for the riots. James Miles was there to report on the riots, so he would ask questions pertaining to the riots. If they actually wanted to separate, I can tell you right now that, logically, they would've TOLD THEM they wanted to and would say something to the effect of """"FREE US, WE WANT TO SEPARATE"""", but they did not. They just explained their issues, which were socioeconomic and ethnic issues. In addition, James Miles states: """"The rioting seemed primarily an eruption of ethnic hatred."""",which I'm guessing he had to interview many rioters/residents to ask them about it. And rather, I don't think the Rodney King article is worded very well- it should be changed, but I'm guessing many people are already well-informed of the real reasons for those riots, unlike this riot where few seem to understand- including you! And, come on now, you're obviously just picking at straws to try to twist the article. All evidence so far points to the rioters looting and beating ethnic Han chinese out of hatred, not because they want to separate or they would've attacked much more government buildings rathern than focussing on the stores of more wealthy Chinese people.

 Koch family links in header  

So  reverted this which I guess is partially responsible for the full scale protection now, but, I added this into the header which I believe warrants to be in it:

It has been speculated that the Tea Party was created in the interests of the Koch family, to undermine environmental regulations such as cap and trade. Many groups such as FreedomWorks and Americans for Prosperity were started by the Koch family to advocate political goals.

Some of the core groups were created by the Koch family, it's heavily funded by the family and has promoted the Koch's goals explicitly, I don't see why this isn't in the header.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

It's not connected to the Arab world in the same way that the Arab states are connected to each other, and is only included by dint of being a Middle Eastern autocracy.  But I believe that WP:COMMON should be our guide, and in this regard, media seems to be contrasting Iran with the Arab countries, rather than including them.
I ran a Google News search for """"Iran Arab Spring"""" and will list a run-down of the treatment by sources on the first page:
The Christian Science Monitor refers to """"protests sweeping the Arab World"""".
The Huffington Post refers to """"another spring on the Iranian scene."""".
The next two articles, and two later down talk about the threat posed by Iran to the Arab Spring,  or Arab World 
The next article talks about Blackwater for some reason. 
Jerusalem Post calls its article """"Arab spring, Persian winter."""" 'Nuff said.
The BBC includes Iran with China and Azerbaijan as related protests. 
The AFP (Whatever that is) says that Iran is different from the Arab countries, but also uses Arab spring to refer to the protesters there.  At four days old, it's the second oldest source on the front page. 
The oldest article, coming from The Telegraph, doesn't provide any indications either way.

It is true that there are millions who believe that JEDP was birthed in hell (or would believe it if they knew what JEDP means), so in principle their view is notable, but as Enns said, it is a fringe view in the academe, even among scholars who actually disagree with JEDP. The sources used to build Wikipedia are academic sources, therefore JEDP and its 20-21st century offspring are given by default the weight they have inside the academia, while the view of the fundamentalists is treated according to WP:UNDUE. This does not mean that Wikipedia could say that the fundamentalists are theologically wrong (Wikipedia has no theology of its own), but it is entitled to say that inside historical scholarship they are a fringe view. Of course, this does not exclude serious scholarship done at religious faculties, since as Ehrman said in one of his bestsellers, US mainline Protestant and Catholic theological seminaries and divinity schools do teach mandatory historical criticism classes. So, in a sense, scholars from such faculties are thoroughly acquainted with historical criticism and built their careers upon its assumptions.

Conflation of the two """"brook"""" homonyms

that crosses between two other bodies of water. This may be US usage but it certainly is not of the UK. (thus """"brooking"""" them) The stream brook derives from Anglo-Saxon broc. The acceptance verb derives from AS brucan. There seems to be little connection. Also the Scottish term for a creek. It is not particularly Scottish. And has to do with creek only in the US usage. ( 08:43, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC))

 RJP was correct that the two brook homonyms were being conflated.  AHD4 says that brook the transitive verb (""""To put up with; tolerate"""") comes from Middle English brouken, from Old English brūcan, """"to use, enjoy"""". (BTW, that's interesting, because today's German verb brauchen can mean """"to use"""". Clearly cognate.)

 Meanwhile, brook the noun (""""stream"""") is a homonymous word coming from a different root, via Middle English, from Old English brōc.

  

Section was missing

is part of the article missing?  the last section is empty.  
thalweg says """"see below"""" but there is nothing there. [alex]

Changes to the article
I propose that the """"Types of water streams"""" section be changed. I have been unable to corroborate the brook definition given. The definition I found most often is a stream smaller in size than a creek. It is also used when the water source is a spring or seep. When """"stream"""" is not used in the generic sense, I've found various definitions. Some have it as being the smallest of all and some have it as just below a river. I guess we can continue only giving the generic definition.   

Better image was wanted

I feel that the first image, of a """"running stream,"""" is not very accurate, given we see water still enough for duckweed to accumulate in large amounts.  I don't doubt that it could be a flowing system, but it is hardly what I picture when I close my eyes and think """"running stream.""""  Nitpicky, yes.  

Looking at the current version of the article, this appears to have been fixed.  

 Categories suggestions 
Suggestion:  Make a category about Daylighting (streams) for neighborhoods (plese see article also—the list is already getting long), sections # Some neighborhoods with daylighting projects and # Other places.  A child article or something will eventually need be spun off.

Since each daylighted stream exists only as an intimate component of the neighborhoods of the watershed, linking the streams and neighborhoods in a category could be very useful.  Various daylighting projects exist all over the world, though so far we have Seattle, San Francisco, and Berkeley.  There exist similar projects restoring natural areas in urban settings, distinct from parks.  One is Union Bay Natural Area, another is a marsh north of San Francisco or in northern California (Eureka?) that is also providing habitat and tertiary sewage treatment, rather than having been drained.  (The most-recognized level is conventional secondary treatment.)

Suggestion:  Make a category of natural areas in urban settings.  This is tangentially related to the Georgia Basin Ecosystem Initiative at Salish Sea.

Comments, discussion?  How to tie into existing, relevant articles?

The Daylighting (streams) article could use more diverse examples

 

Stream is limited to Southern England?
I'm sorry, but the quote 'Stream is limited to Southern England,' in reference to the word 'stream' itself is total nonsense.Only the broadest of Yorkshiremen, for example, use only the word 'beck.' I am not adversed to words like these being mentioned in the stream article, but can people please try to avoid making such sweeping statements about them?

 BUSH AND JFK 

The recent 50th anniversary upsurge in Kennedy assasination interest and the imminent releast of classified information in 2017 has caused many conspiracy theories to be re-examined.  More often GHW Bush's name is linked as a conspirator and funder of the conspiracy.  His favoring of Nixon at the time and his oil interests superficially endorse this theory, as does the depth of Nixon's corrupt and dupklicitous influence on those close to him.

I feel the biog needs to highlight this aspect of GHWB's career, especially as both Bush presidents were such avid war-mongers their financial interests must have relied heavily on the """"military-industrial"""" influence that Eisenhower warned the nation against.  Bush's attitudes to war in the middle east directly reflects the false policies which prolonged the Vietnam war.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Vandalism on King's Daughters by  

I had to ask your help on this about seven weeks ago when this user regularly trolled the discussion page with ethnically insulting remarks.  You put up a warning that you'd block the entire range if they continued trolling.  After laying off for seven weeks, they're at it again.

His original troll was:
These """"women"""" were prostitutes; so much for the fwench """"pure wool"""" garbage; nothing pure here. When your ancestors were prostitutes, as is the case of the fwench Canadians, it is curious how the decedants describe themselves as pure!

Just to be sure there was no misunderstanding in the matter, I included a report from two of the three main reference works on les filles du roi that tells of one girl (one out of approximately 800) who was charged in Canada with prostitution (not a French prostitute, but a woman who was accused of falling into that life after arrival), and his comment is now:

If there is at least one prostitute among these fine young ladies then we are no longer speaking of """"Rumors and urban legends."""" The article claims only one was """"charged""""; that hardly aquits these pure-woolly """"women.""""

He also put in an NPOV marker and asked for a fact citation on the one story; it comes from two of the three books, and this is much too small an article for me to have to make individual citations when I list the three books as references.

You gave this person the trolling warning before, and he is violating it again.  I believe his IP range should be blocked.

While I realize Wikipedia is not a link list I feel that all those sites should be included. I have also moved the """"Breif history of Chabad Messianism""""  to the historical sites section from it's original location in the Chabad Messianic sites section since it's not a Mashichist propaganda, but the author of the article simply presents an overview of the development of the Moshiach identification campaign within Chabad and further states elsewhere on his site that he doesn't believe the Rebbe is Moshiach therefore it obviously doesn't belong in the Chabad Messianic sites section.
I have also added the http://www.YudelKrinsky.com as satire is just another way to convey information and studying it creates a clearer picture about the issue in the mind of a serious Wikipedia reader.

I think the pic of a 1979 Austin Allegro is actually a Vanden Plas either 1500 or 1750 model.

It had a classic wood and leather interior including walnut picnic tables recessed into the backs of the front seats, and the different frontal treatment you can see hints of in the pic. The VP was something of a freak - who was it aimed at in marketing terms and did anyone ever associate Allegros with luxury motoring? It was probably produced because Ford was having big success with the Ghia versions of some of its models, upgraded and laden with extras for which a premium price was charged, and cash-strapped BL was desperate for some of the action. The reason for raising this is that VPs weren't actually badged as Austins (or Allegros for that matter), but sold as a separate marque albeit through the same BL dealderships,so the pic shouldn't appear on the Austin history page cos it isn't.

 Interesting, the same thing appears to be happening for another logo on the page that wasn't uploaded by me. I wonder if there's some sort of bug. In the meantime, do you know if there's a way to remove the deletion request, or at least ensure that the logos will not be removed as scheduled?  
 Go to Special:ApiSandbox and select """"purge"""" in the """"Action"""" drop-down box. Tick the """"forcelinkupdate"""" checkbox.

 POV  talk section moved 

POV

i've tried to clean things up a bit though someone else will have to remove the vandalistically applied christianity template lest i be reported for """"edit warring"""" by humus.   i've added a link to the christianity and judaism portals in the """"see also"""" section.   these links are more fitting than claiming this is """"part of the series on christianity""""

this article was very heavy on anti-jfj stuff.  a lengthy """"criticism"""" section as well as criticisms inserted into nearly every other section.  the missionaries are """"taught to speak in hebrew"""" (these people already went to hebrew school!) and jfj is known to """"target vulnerable jews"""" (oh really?) and """"most of the funding comes from christians"""" (well did we think it was coming from muslims and religious jews?) and the current leader """"is not jewish"""" (even though his mother, father, all grandparents were apparently jewish)

some of the criticisms' references were just opinion pieces from religious jews who oppose conversion.  most come from biased publications that don't meet wikipedia's reliable sources standards.  including these references is analogous to editing the """"buddhism"""" article to say that """"all buddhists will burn in hell"""" along with a reference to some fire-n-brimstone website.

anyway, if all we're trying to get across is that some, even many, jewish people and groups oppose jfj we don't need to spread it all over the article.  it isn't at all surprising that religious jews don't want other jews to accept jesus  every missionary movement is opposed by someone.

 

Friend, your edits pushed your delusion that J4J is just another Jewish denomination that a bunch of long-bearded Hassidim oppose. You don't seem to comprehend how the group ruffles feathers throughout the whole length and breadth of the Jewish community even among commies and even among a lot of Christians, as it is contrary to the spirit of modern ecumenicism. J4J is as much defined by the hostility to it as anything else. That is the state of play. I think that you can make a case if you feel the wording is not neutral, but you can't water down the unanimous opposition to J4J and call that """"NPOV"""" 

Thanks for the """"friend"""", nice words are always welcome, even though the rest is not.   Please don't accuse me of """"pushing my delusions"""".   Some jewish groups may strongly oppose them, but there's no way to show that """"all"""" """"mainstream"""" jewish groups, including """"secular"""" groups """"strongly"""" oppose them, without taking the liberty of defining who """"all"""" the """"mainstream"""" jewish groups are, and what degree of """"opposition"""" is """"strong"""".  Can you really not see this simple truth?
Beyond that it just isn't appropriate to overwhelm this article with criticism.  I outlined this above already.   Statements like j4j approachs """"vulnerable jews"""" are unabashedly POV  and tautological.  If anyone converts then its clear they were """"vulnerable"""" to conversion,  so if anyone approached converts, then j4j has approaches """"vulnerable jews"""".
It's not in question that all missionary groups are converting someone from some belief system to another, but it is only barely notable that someone opposes this conversion.  Does McDonald's oppose Burger King and try to put them out of business at every turn?  Yes...but who cares?  Do drug smugglers """"strongly oppose"""" DEA agents coming along and busting up their operations?   Yes...but it would be silly to put it in an article.   Everyone has opposition and it just goes without saying.   Still, I wouldn't be """"strongly opposed"""" to his article having a section on opposition, but nearly every corner of this article is littered with criticism that is all essentially the same.
Compare this article to that of any other missionary group.   In the article """"christianity"""" is there a section labeled """"incompatibility with paganism"""" and """"a belief that is incompatible with paganism"""" and """"all pagan groups strongly oppose christianity""""?   Do we see """"incompatibility with catholicism"""" in the protestant article?   I know this analogy is not going to be satisfying, but no analogy is ever complete.
What are the further objections?   Yes, the group may be called """"Jews for Jesus"""" and that offends people, but what would you have them call themselves?   Would """"Jews that are now christians but still consider themselves jewish"""" be better?  They did use Jackie Mason in a pamphlet.   They also used Steve Jobs and Curious George, and a whole bunch of others, but i don't see Steve Jobs supporters here furious about Jews for jesus """"deceiving"""" ipod owners into believing in jesus.

14:58, 21 September 2009 Kelly A. Siebecke (talk | contribs) (10,340 bytes) (the facts were there and JoyDiamond insists on replacing them, removing them, or exaggerating them - edit reverted) 
This just an example of the misrepresentation of the type of continued harassment I have been receiving from Kelly Siebecke.
I replaced parts of articles that were erroneous, removed undue repetition, I exaggerated nothing.
I received a warning this morning that I had been previously warned about removing anything from Kelly's talk page. This is simply untrue. Her only warning was not to TALK (what are talk pages for ?)
A little history: I am a senior citizen who is an acquaintance of Karel Bouley. My first edits were to change things I considered unkind and then all heck ensued as I was told I was not using an objective point of view. My mistake. After discussion with  Feral Druid and another editor, I apologized for my error and assured them  I could be objective and neutral. They accepted that.I am not a wide-eyed fan or close friend. We have a very intermittent working relationship. However, I am privy to the truth of his schedule, personal facts, his history and the details of the death of his partner, whom I also knew. I also participate in his chat room. 
In the chat room, I was warned that there was a room who ostensibly had a grudge against Karel and that may be in an issue. I didn't really take it seriously. As I mentioned I am an older woman with much experience in dealing with difficult people. So, I was not expecting any problems. FYI, I have a Master's degree in Medical Sociology, a Doctorate in divinity. In my B.A. studies I minored in Communication and problem resolution. 
In my observation of Karel's article, I began to notice subtle and not so subtle changes in his article that were making it increasingly negative, positive aspects were deleted even though properly referenced. I made what I considered objective and neutral edits. My edits were reversed and replaced with even more negativity. AS I fumbled my way thru Wiki I discovered the history page and the person of Kelly Siebeck. I checked with the person who had warned me and found it was indeed Kelly. He described it as a vendetta after she had been banned from chat. She denies this is not the issue and angrily claims she is not angry! Please read her  page and decide for yourself about this woman. The problem has escalated recently into personal attacks, removing positive facts and their references. She will tell you I am not good at references. She is right. Feral Druid has been very kind in helping me with those. I still have a lot to learn. BUT I will correct information that is an outright lie and/or demeaning to Karel. I have deleted several times her claim that one of his radio shows was once a week. It is a daily show and was properly reference until she deleted it. SO  now I am reported for excessive deleting of outright misrepresentation and lies!
I do not want to argue with this woman claims her knowledge is superior to mine. That is just ludicrous. I have 14 years of education and 40 years of experience of which she had no knowledge when she claimed she was just WAY more informed than I was. I would just like her to cease and desist and preferably be blocked from Karel's page. Go back to the original article and compare if you can. I will have NO reason to edit when Karel's page is cleaned up and stays that way. Karel has requested that it be locked. There is no reason to repeat he was fired at the beginning of too many sentences. She does that repeatedly. Yes, he was fired, Twice. No reason to repeat it over and over. Much of his colorful history and various talents have been deleted. It is sad. I tried writing her a nice ministerial letter to no avail. I am tired. I edit ONE article and am repeatedly attacked dismissed and insulted.  She is petty and without relent. AS the """"great"""" philosopher Rodney King said """"why can't everybody just be nice? ;-) I work with Karel. I know the good the bad and the ugly, and will record such as long it is truthful and factual.
I am sorry this dear woman a has a problem with Karel and myself. What started out as a relatively decent article has turned mean spirited and wildly inaccurate. Karel is controversial enough with someone adding to it. Please help. I am a nice lady with a little temper. My grandchildren think I am awesome. I am funny, I have something to contribute. I was Valedictorian at age 42. Work with me please. I thought if I could work with Karel I could work with anyone. I was wrong.

 Since I feel that this is an important topic I have made an effort to update and improve the article, although this is not an area of expertise for me and this has limited what I am able to do. As I see it the purpose of the article should be, as with articles such as Automotive industry in the United Kingdom or Automobile industry in China, to provide a concise overview of the industry including its history, current state and economic impact, important products and companies. 

 I agree that the list of first flights is not appropriate. In my view this should be changed into a prose description of the history of the industry, with some of the first flight details being woven into the text as appropriate.

 I have started trying to improve the 'Major participants' section but in my view this requires more work. The 'Current developments' section contains a lot of interesting and useful information but appears to need some updating.

This is my last reply if you continue to present yourself in this manner.  Please write more civilly.

I expect people to go to Oyster Bay just as I expect them to go to Barre, Vermont.  When you type that, do you expect a disambiguation page or do you except the city?  Admittedly, it's not the most convenient, but that's the way it is in all eight """"town"""" states.  Are you going to try to change every single community with this sort of disambiguation?  If so, go ahead — but unless you so desire, don't try to have one or two changed.  You speak of errors that result (for example, the Oyster Bay disambiguation page) — I do my best to fix wrong links as a result of changes such as this, but I don't see why I must be held responsible for every single wrong link.  If you never make mistakes, that's good; but I suspect that you so do.  So what?  It doesn't matter if you make a good-faith error, especially if you try to fix it once you realise that something's wrong.

By the way, if you put """"Oyster Bay, New York"""" into the Census Bureau's Factfinder, you'll get this page: it's the town.  Barre, Vermont is similar to what we'd call a disambiguation page; the city is listed as Barre city, Vermont.  This, I expect, is the reason that these articles are named this way: the Census is our source for the names and the basic information, and therefore we entitle our articles likewise by this reliable source.

 This is an interesting discussion with good points made by all. I can add a little bit that might be helpful. As mentioned by the editors above the dictionay definition and a legal definition are not the same and one state's legal definition might be different from another's. So why not say this in the article. What definition a reader needs or wants depends on their purpose. For example, if a young person is reading a book meant for older persons and comes across the word adultery, his needs will be far different than those of a lawyer who's client walks in and says, """"They charged me with 'adultery'; what's that?"""" In the first case the reader might need nothing more than a dictionary definition (or perhaps a little more, particularly that it is rare for someone to go to jail for it), and in the second case, the lawyer will want to explain all the elements of the crime (each thing that must be proved by the government in order to find someone guilty, including that it was done knowingly, etc.).

 The beginning could say: """"Adultery, in some jurisdictions a crime or a tort (a civil wrong) is generally defined as (insert dictionary definition). However in the legal context of a person actually being charged with adultery as a crime or cited as a grounds for a divorce or other lawsuit, a more precise definition would be required.

 The term adultery usually refers to the rarely prosecuted common law or statutory crime relating to having extra-marital relations, but usually in an informal or literary context not in a legal context.

 In ordinary usage the vagueness of the term is not a hindrance to communication, as the scope of the term is understood to change from context to context, some requiring more specifics than others. In a legal sense, residents of the United States, for example, understand that such laws differ from state to state, and even from time to time as laws are changed, and thus any legal use of the term is understood to require new research practically any time it comes up.""""

Baroque Guitars are NOT """"ten-string guitars""""

Andrew, frankly, you are mistaken. It is incorrect to refer to a baroque guitar as a """"ten-string guitar"""". No one refers to the baroque lute as """"the 24-string lute"""", but correctly as the 13-course lute. This is a well-established musicological/organological convention. """"12-string guitar"""" is the only exception to this, and that is only because the term has been disseminated by the popular """"cult(ure)"""" in the usual brainwashed ignorance of the masses. If two strings function as one string, they are a COURSE, not two separate strings. In contrast, a ten-stringed guitar has ten separate strings each of which can be separately fretted. This is not the case on the baroque guitar, which effectively only has five courses. Moreover, the term """"ten-string"""" guitar has come to signify a particular instrument, which is NOT a baroque guitar. You are evidently not a musicologist/organologist/semiologist/semantician so I don't see what you think you will achieve by being bothersome about this issue, which relates to organology and semantics.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I removed the (big soup) claim at the top of the article and revised the Etymology section.  Minestra is Italian for soup and -one is an augmentative suffix.  It could be translated as """"big soup,"""" but that is perhaps too literal.  In any case, saying that it means """"big soup"""" does not aid understanding, but rather confuses.  Why is it big?  Is it made in large quantities?  Are the vegetables big?  And so on.  It is sufficient to say that minestra means soup and -one is an augmentative suffix.
Under Etymology, I made changes to improve conciseness.  It is not necessary to cite every etymologically related word (i.e., """"minister"""" and """"minus""""); in fact, doing so clearly caused confusion since an editor in the History section of this article refers the reader to the Etymology section for the 14th c. appearance of minestrone.

There is currently little evidence for the efficacy of homeopathy for the treatment of ADHD.

...some homeopathically prepared remedies show promise for reducing infarct size and associated impairments...Individualized homeopathy may even play a helpful adjunctive role in treatment of sepsis. However, a great deal of systematic research effort lies ahead before most of the options discussed would meet mainstream medical standards for introduction into routine treatment regimens.

...experiments with a high methodological standard could demonstrate an effect of high potencies. No positive result was stable enough to be reproduced by all investigators. A general adoption of succussed controls, randomization and blinding would strengthen the evidence of future experiments.

The evidence from rigorous clinical trials of any type of therapeutic or preventive intervention testing homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments is not convincing enough for recommendations in any condition.

The [studies] were generally of low methodological quality...Homeopathic medicines, tested in HPTs, appear safe. The central question of whether homeopathic medicines in high dilutions can provoke effects in healthy volunteers has not yet been definitively answered, because of methodological weaknesses of the reports...

The results suggest that, for several treatments, the risk-benefit profile is encouraging...For other therapies the evidence is weak or contradictory: homeopathy...

Complex Homoeopathy...showed inconclusive results.

effectiveness of homeopathy can be supported by clinical evidence and professional and adequate application be regarded as safe.

Waya sahoni.  Who is Jeffrey Vernon Merkey?  I've seen the name and that you've been accused of being this person.  Before I go into this article please tell me about him.  My email is MythicWeb 

He is one of our brothers and a citizen of the Cherokee Nation.  The people on that article are members of SCOX, an Anti-Native-American Group who post hate speech against Indian Peoples.  These people have been posting a lot of negative content and POV pushing about him.  They acuse anyone of sockpuppetry who goes near the article.  Thanks for policing my user page.  Please feel free to revert it again  they are creating sockpuppets accounts and are warring with us over some discussion I posted to the Talk page. A very rowdy group.  They also accussed you of sockpuppetry and of being Merkey.   

No one ever accused Bookofsecrets of being Merkey.  I pointed out his admission and apology for past sockpuppetry and suggested that he should teach you to abandon that behavior.  The Yahoo SCOX bulletin board discusses the SCO Group stock and related issues, including Merkey's aid to SCO's cause and his business connections to them.  Claiming that they are an Anti-Native-American Group who post hate speech against Indian Peoples is both  libelous untrue and silly.  —

I'm currently interested in just the principles involved in the radio signal scenario... and what conclusions inductive reasoning leads to.

I don't think it would be proper inductive reasoning to see a PNRS is caused by some intelligence, another PNRS is caused by intelligence, and to induce that the third PNRS is probably caused by some intelligence. There are unknown possible ways to generate a PNRS, and they cannot be ruled out simply because experience shows a couple other examples. This feels like the political approach to space shuttle launches about 10 years ago. Back in the day, designers speced the space shuttle to be safe for launch within a certain range of temperatures. Florida has uncooperative weather and often goes outside the safe range. Politicians wanted the shuttle to launch because it's good for elections. So, they pressure the upper management of NASA to launch outside the designed safe range. This happened a number of time without problem. At some point, management decided that the designers were wrong, and that a couple of launches outside their declared safe range meant that the real safe range was much wider. This continued for a few more launches until a space shuttle exploded on launch because it was too cold. If you shuffle a deck and pull 3 or 4 face cards in a row from the top of the deck, you can't really make any sort of probability measure as to what the next card will be. it could be a deck of only face cards. It could be many full decks. it could be a stacked deck. probabilities can't be determined off of a few rolls of the dice. two cases showing the PNRS was from an alien planet is not enough to make any sort of real probability estimate on the third PNRS. This is playing on a """"gut feeling"""" that people have when they're playing roulette. casino's will post the last 20 rolls. Some gamblers will see these numbers and look for some sort of """"pattern"""" and bet based off of that, on the """"gut feeling"""" that the roullette wheel has some bias. They may even win a few times. But the casino is better off if the wheel is truly random, so any """"patterns"""" is purely coincidental.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

In ictu oculi
As has been explained, """"POVfork"""" is one of the ritual phrases you incant on this page; because it defies reality, it is an excuse to avoid meaningful discourse, rather than an attempt at achieving it. If you mean something else, which you likely do, then use words that are accurate and express your meaning, rather than obsessively repeating obviously false statements.
As has also been explained, repeating long lists of last names, without any context (e.g. """"Voorst, Horbury, Schafer, Berger, Maier, Meier, Theissen, Klausner, Rubenstein, Boyarin, Teppler, Stanton & Stroumsa, Kessler, Sanders, Neusner"""") are also ritual behaviors that have little semantic content. You have been challenged to produce actual citations, which would include book names, author, year, page number, and relevant quotations. You continually refuse or fail to do so.
When you finally produce a citation that more-or-less complies with WP:CITE (albeit with completely idiosyncratic formatting), you still get it wrong. For example, you just now added what you describe as """"Quarles (2008)"""". In fact, the reference is Bauckham (2008): I know this because I added it myself three weeks ago! Not only that, the material you added was already present in the article, in the very section in which I added the citation! If you do not read the article, then how can you comment on its contents, much less attempt to edit them?
I have kept your Voorst citation, and again, put it where it belongs. For the longest time, the lede had the sentence """"There are some modern scholars who understand these passages to be references to Christianity and the Christian figure of Jesus"""", with the citation Such as Dalman This reference, of course, is one of your infamous """"last name only"""" citations, which completely fail WP:CITE. Rather than replace it with Voorst, who makes the same point, and is a century newer, you oddly repeat the material in a second sentence. There is no rational explanation for doing this that I can see.
We absolutely do have a neutral first sentence in the lede, despite your best attempts to the contrary - that was the clear consensus of the RFC above. You fixation on the claim that Yeshu does not refer to an individual or individuals leaves you in a very difficult spot. It has been your on-going contention that the name """"Yeshu"""" is merely the name used by rabbis for Jesus. However, when you insist that """"Yeshu"""" does not refer to an individual, or demand proof that it does, what you are also demanding is proof that """"Jesus"""" refers to an individual, since it is you that insists """"Yeshu""""=""""Jesus"""". Do you not believe Jesus was and indivudal? Are you promoting, then, the Jesus myth theory?
I am doing my best still to assume good faith here; unfortunately, to do so, I am forced to come to the conclusion that the issue with your edits and comments here is one of competence. I am now very strongly encouraging you to propose changes here, accurately citing the reliable sources you would like to use to support those edits.

 Further response.... 

Mr. Galal, you seem, perhaps, frustrated. This is understandable, since you work for Medcan and you surely want the Wikipedia article to include only promotional information. However, Wikipedia strives to tell the whole truth. 
- If wikipedia strives to tell the whole truth, then you should say that even though the Danish Meta Study brings up valid arguments regarding physical examinations and their impact on health outcomes, generally speaking physical examinations are widely accepted and useful healthcare screening tools. I suspect every first world country recommends medicals with a General Practitioner - your comment is stating that these countries health organizations and policy makers are incorrect. And that medicals schools are also incorrect in their lessons.  And we may as well change how medicine is practiced and treat people when they get sick, not try to catch disease early.

The meta-study itself is fairly recent (just two years old). It was brought to us thanks to the prestigious Cochrane Collaboration. I see no reason why a Danish meta-study would be inapplicable to Canada, though you are welcome to try to convince me otherwise.

I won't dispute your point that most people in First World countries undergo routine physical examinations. And I won't dispute that they are customary. But have they been proven to be useful? Not to my knowledge.
- This is an astonishingly closed minded comment.  Medcan alone has hundreds of cases where we've saved peoples lives, improved there lives, provided them insight for future care, etc.  The word """"useful"""" is vague - useful as in leading a healthier life?  Absolutely.  Useful as in keeping someone alive who has a terminal illness - probably not.

I think there is more than enough here for you to understand why we have such an issue with this comment on the Medcan wikipedia page.  If this was an Encyclopedia - there is not a chance it would be posted.  There is no facts or evidence that the Danish study is 100% true - and Medcan's model of care is not just to diagnose, but to also help people through lifestyle modifcation and coaching.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

You  are under the influence of a severe WP:COI attack. Remember a COI could be spotted not only by defending but also by attacking a particular project/idea (like you are doing here).
You have erased (I think it was you even when that edition it is not signed) the independent links that support the inclusion of SERVA in this page. You have erased links to articles written by many different people from many different languages, you have erased the kind of link you couldn't provide for supporting the projects that you are SPONSORING here.
My proposed changes are based in facts that you cannot take (and dare to erase); You are PROMOTING projects here; you do not provide independent sources, then I do not have to convince you. You are definitely biased here.

I want to report  for erasing the research material I have included when supporting one of the projects ERASED by him in this page.

1)  systematiclly refuses to provide the bases for supporting COBBLER inclusion. He does not have/know how to articulate the support for the mentioned project. I encourage talk to finally provide to the WP community the supporting material for the inclusion of this project here. He is the one that systematically forces the inclusion of this project; it has to be him who knows and proves to the community the value of the mentioned project. My guideline based argument for removing COBBLER is that that project it is not representative of the PXE state of art.

I want to report  as a biased editor whose behavior could be very well understood under the terms of WP:COI.

2) You cannot say ditto; the guideline based argument for removing EL TORITO  was clearly stated before; you are definitely not WP:LISTENing here. EL TORITO has nothing to do with PXE.

3) Again a magnificent display of WP:COI; your COI. You are trying to twist things putting the blame on me but that will not change facts: There is no independent material available for supporting the inclusion of ERPXE. Peroid. Again it is YOU who scream COI here while supporting one of your projects. Bring the material and I'll shut up. If not it isn't me the one that has to shut up here.

4) your WP:COI is amazing; you cannot take defeat; and no matter what I write you want to promote the projects that you want while banning SERVA. If I bring links you erase the links, if I bring facts and arguments you call me """"dead horse"""". You do not care about WP you just care about not bending your arm. You have no clue about PXE but you pretend to rule how the PXE page is written based on your guts feelings and personal taste.

In 1987, Spotts shared an award with three Monitor colleagues for a series on the future of nuclear energy following the 1986 nuclear accident at Chernobyl. In 2003, he received an American Association for the Advancement of Science's Science Journalism Award.

 This guy is guilty of paying $160k for work that reasonably would have cost up to $150k ???   

Something I don't understand here.

Am I correct that the crux of the case against Stevens was that he got some work done to his house for a reduced cost as part of some kind of kick-back?

What exactly were the 7 charges against him?

The residential contractor who finished the renovation for VECO, Augie Paone, """"believes the [Stevens'] remodeling could have cost ― if all the work was done efficiently ― around $130,000 to $150,000, close to the figure Stevens cited last year.""""[62] The Stevens paid $160,000 for the rennovations """"and assumed that covered everything.

So was there any question Stevens paid the $160k he claimed?

If he did, and if the work is reasonably valued at $150k, then how on earth can the prosecution claim he got some sort of unreported gift or illegal kickback?""",0,0,0,0,0,0

So , aside from your insults, are you saying that 50 million people in England are English? The total population of England is English?
Do you think it OK to use the total population of England as the indicator for the numbers of English in England. If that is the case then for the Cornish people page the total population of Cornwall should be used for the numbers of Cornish?.

Secondly it is not my claim that there are 250,000 Cornish people so what are you going on about? All i have added of late is that a recent survey found that 44% of the Cornish populace thought themselves Cornish rather than British or English.

according to a recent Morgan Stanley Bank survey, 44 per cent of the inhabitants of Cornwall believe themselves to be Cornish rather than British or English

Hey AzaToth and others, right now I'm waiting on hearing back from legal on a few points, and I just made some internal pokes again.

 Good Article Progress... 

There are several great Disney character articles on Wikipedia, but very few of them are classified GA. I am really trying to transform Belle into a good article, like Ariel from The Little Mermaid...how am I doing so far? Thoughts? Suggestions? I know the article is no where near nomination status...I would just like a few guidelines.

Just a thought but other minor films that she appeared in could be merged down in one section with a few mentions about the films without going into huge detail about them. Something like she's appeared in spin-off films regarding the character, something like that you know? Doesn't need a subsection for each movie it makes the article clunky. All of her appearances don't have to be put into such great detail; like the Kingdom Hearts info goes too far into the it, just a short summary would suffice. And I'm sure that you're aware that the article needs more info on the character's cultural impact, stuff like that. The information on the development seems, okay same amount in the Ariel article so there's that. I'd suggest getting rid of the list of Broadway Actresses it's kind of an eye sore, just a thought. Or put it to prose Yum. 

Another thing I noticed while I was editing the page, there are a lot of references to IMDB (the whole production cast and stuff like that, you used IMDB) when there are a lot of other options. The film usually has documentaries on production where you can get that info; that's where I got a lot of info when writing the Ariel article, and the commentaries are useful too. What I'm saying is that there's a tone of info on this character out there (the Blu-Ray has a tone of extras and documentaries that could be of use). And if you don't own the dvds or whatever I'd assume YouTube could be of service. And when you're citing your sources remember to put the original date that the information was published and all the access date stuff too. But it's going to take a while Yum. 

Believe it or not, I have actually been trying to use sources other than IMDb. The majority of my character development information came from other online sources. As for film and production documentaries, I am still new on learning how to source those, but I will look into it. And I always thought the """"date"""" section in the source template was meant for the date that you found the information. Thanks for letting me know!   

 Belle's eye color 

First off, there are no evidence that Belle's eyes are brown, just like there are no evidence that Aurora's eyes are blue. The movies, the Disney Princess website, the franchise and merchandise, and official artwork all depict Belle with hazel eyes and Aurora with violet eyes. And saying that there's only one person in the entire world who believes Belle's eyes are hazel is ridiculous. Search the internet, the people who believe her eyes are hazel are way more than the people who believe her eyes are brown.

People who claim her eyes are brown have no evidence to back that up. An article with an interview with the voice actress is not a good evidence, it's just a bunch of words. What evidence does the voice actress herself have to back up what she's saying?! It can't be any of the movies, they tell a different story.

A quote from the actress - """"She was also the first brown-eyed princess, the rest had blue eyes. She had a quirkiness and an oddness about her so many girls identified with Belle because they feel there is a part of her that is like them.""""

There are THREE lies buried in that first sentence; 1) Snow White was the first brown-eyed princess, not someone else. 2) Not all of the previous Princesses have blue eyes; Snow White has brown eyes and Aurora has violet eyes - that's half (2 out of 4) of the Princesses that do not have blue eyes. And 3) Belle's eyes are not brown as the movies themselves and other stuff will show you.

There's nothing wrong with articles as long as they don't condradict anything, but Paige O'Hara's words contradicted not one, but THREE things about the Disney Princesses.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I think you're confused in regards to the definition of state. I see that you live in California, United States, which furthers my assumptions. There is more to the word """"state"""" than the """"US state"""" (e.g. Texas, Missouri, etc) definition; a sovereign state is a political entity that we call Canada, or Serbia, or Cambodia. With this definition, China, Philippines and Japan are """"states"""". The terms """"state"""", """"nation"""" and """"country"""" refer to concepts which may be similar, however still have their small distinctions. In order to avoid ambiguity, it's better to refer to objects such as China, Japan, Britain, Russia, the United States, France, et cetera as sovereign states, instead of the two alternative terms. A sovereign state is largely defined in modern contexts based on Westphalian sovereignty, whilst the definitions of nation and country differ depending on various contexts.I wouldn't put too much thought on what the Chinese Wikipedia says on this issue. The Chinese language, like all languages, has its limitations in that there is no one-to-one correspondence with English political vocabulary. The English words """"state"""", """"nation"""" and """"country"""" are all translated as """"國"""" in Chinese, as Chinese does not make such a distinction.

I would change it, but I know that x86 drivers that are user mode can be used in Windows x64 8. I can in fact provide proof that this is the case.

There is only x86 drivers right now, but I can assure you that X86 drivers can run in Windows X64, provided they do not run in Kernel mode. Presumably, this driver is User mode, which Microsoft allows. It is also unsigned, but Windows X64 installed it anyway (proving it couldn't be x64 because Windows won't install 64 bit drivers unsigned. I can give some screenshots proving this.

 Ununseptium (in some time) 

Hi, Double sharp. As you know, there's that At FAC going on at the moment, but, in some time, it will be over, and there's also that ununseptium article waiting for the spotlight. I came to ask some help from you with that, I hope it won't be too difficult for you (it shouldn't be, but there may also be those RL issues, that's why I'm asking some time before I could actually start).

I think the article is great. It was a FAC in 2012, but it was failed due to prose quality. It's, however, not 2012 now, and some work will be required. I would love you to help me check things against accessibility. I was writing that article with non-technical readers in mind (and it actually turned out to be among the easiest to do so among all superheavies). I don't really expect to get that """"oh, wow, I knew nothing, but now I seem to get it"""" from all readers, but I want it to be at least a stable """"well, it's not easy, but I seem to get it."""" I think History and Naming are fine, and so is Nuclear stability, but those last two subsections need some look at; some examples of what I want to improve are """"the valence electron configuration is predicted to be 7s27p5"""" (because what does that mean? We need to explain it) and """"1.67 D"""" (we say it's a """"relatively small"""" value, but how small, really? Some examples should help a little bit). And also, maybe you've seen some superheavies predictions since then?

I will also check the data available. Wil think how to merge the German experiment into the story (I actually love the story of the discovery the way I wrote it). In the end, will ask for a thorough copyedit.

But that will happen later. Again, the start is not scheduled for tomorrow. What do you think, could you help me with that?  

Sure, I'll help you! I remember how you wrote the discovery: it was really neat. I haven't gone looking for new superheavy predictions in a while, but I'll go looking for them and I'll see what I can come up with.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

The one-r spelling is not an """"implausible"""" typo; firstly, the article was created at that spelling in 2007, while the double-r spelling didn't exist until you created it a week ago.

Or epistemology. Or logic.  We can thank Dewey and the Pragmatists for that.  But I digress. 
While an autodidact (notice the second 'd') is defined as a self-taught person, it is not necessarily the case the reverse is true. 
But we are also talking about connotation and a quirk about English grammar. When you say a person """"is self-taught"""", because taught is in the past tense, it gives the impression of being in the past. It is also ambiguous, as people are likely to say/think/ask, """"self-taught in what?""""  But if you say a person is an autodidact, it maintains the present tense and does not suggest when the self-teaching occurred.  It also implies a general sense of being self-taught. For instance, I taught myself how to program computers. But I don't go around claiming I'm an autodidact. With Langdon, if you say he is """"self-taught"""" and mention his IQ and status as a bouncer, well, that hardly gives a meaningful impression. 
For that reason it's as I stated earlier  an approach to learning. Langan is generally self-taught (or something like that), but more critically, I think, his attitude seems to be """"why should I bother learning from someone who is my intellectual inferior"""". That's the impression I got from the video interview. 
Having said that, I assume someone else did call him an autodidact, right? Because if not, then the whole thing is OR.

Harald88, you are mixing up everything again like an autodidact, and you don't want to listen. You know once again  everything in advance and much better than anybody else. What you are stating here, however, is nonsense again. The classical forerunner of SRT has been  optics of moving bodies, a discipline dealing with the observation of  point source from a moving platform, which is governed by Bradley's law of velocity aberration. A point source emits spherical waves, not plane waves.

In none of the references stated in the nonsensible Wikipedia article on the transverse Doppler effect, to which you have contributed, a proof is delivered, but it is simply asserted there that the transverse Doppler effect has been unknown in classical physics. In dozens of textbooks this nonsense is repeated without proof because authors tend to write off from one another.

'Proofs' of the nonsense are delivered in Chapter 11 of J. D. Jackson's book on clsssical electrodynamics as well as in a German book on SRT by Greiner/Rafelski who probably have copied the 'deduction' offered in Jackson's book (who himself probably got that 'deduction' from somewhere else). These 'deductions' boil down to direct betrayal of naive students, because the students are made to believe that a point source, such as a fixed star, does emit plane waves rather than spherical waves. Nobody tells them that the plane wave approximation is only an approximation and that it is, therefore, completely useless to 'prove' something ia a context of paramount importance. 

The nonsense of the 'non-existing classical Doppler effect' spreads in the literature since Einstein published in 1907 a short note, where he had stated that the transverse Doppler effect, which already Stark wanted to measure (why, if it is unknown in classical optics of moving bodies?), is """"important"""", but not that it is """"unknown"""" in classical physics. It apparently has to do with the hystery which seems to capture most people who get in touch
with the special relativity nonsense.

In reality SRT departs from classical optics of moving bodies solely for the case of longitudinal observation.

This I was going to demonstrate in the article Modern Galilean relativity.

Because of your unprofessional interference with that article I stopped today contributing to it.

Since you have the big mouth and know everything better, I suggest that you finish the article
now. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Personally, I don't believe the """"Controversy"""" section is appropriate for this wiki at all.    At best it is a minor matter of interest only to Exetel users, and for the very great majority of them, it was of no consequence at all.

There are wikis in place for several other Australian ISPs, and none of them have more than a description of the company and their services, plus links to some of their subsidiary companies, and some of their services.    I think something similar is appropriate for the Exetel wiki, and that would appear to be what already exists.

Speaking of links, I also think that many of the links which are currently at the bottom of the Exetel wiki are also inappropriate and should be removed, specifically those that point to """"news"""" stories and """"blogs"""", as these have been prioven to be full of inaccuracies, misconceptions, and outright lies.

I have no idea what drives someone like Macktheknifeau and his fellows to conduct such a malicious, misinformed, and inane attack on a supplier of internet services, even if they have been wronged, and particularly after they have cancelled their service and moved-on to another supplier, but wikipedia is not the place to conduct such an attack.

 request for arbitrage by non greek people 
I request arbitrage for the following:
More then once Greek nationalistic editors removed my contributions
I want non greek people to look into this. It can't be that Wikipedia turns into a greek extremistic and nationalistic propaganda forum
I bought an atlas in witch you can see that the cham area belonged to Albania. (NOM  ROBBE, M. Géographie de M. Robbe. Méthode pour apprendre facilement la Géographie, divisée en deux Tomes. (Tome Premier). Contenant un Abbrégé de la Sphère, la Division de la Terre)
The article below describes how the cham were expelled by the greek.

 Napoleon Zervas 

""""Zervas was forced to resign in 1947, when details of his contacts with the German occupation authorities surfaced"""" This quote came from Wikepedia's biography of Napoleon Zervas. Other sites are more explicit and call him a Nazi collaborateur. Nowadays there are still a lot of greek people that believe that the Cham people were expelled because they collaborated with the Nazi's. However it was Zervas thet collaborated with the Nazi's that expelled them. Shouldn't this be more explicit in this article. There is a UN resolution which asks the Greek government to repatriate the cham and to give back there properties.The rest of this article is lame. I miss the following:

Copyright © 2006 Illyrians.org.
During the Conference of Ambassadors in London in 1913, the southern part of the region was cut off from the motherland and annexed to the Greek state despite the fact that people of the southern Epirus were Albanians of Orthodox and the Muslim faith. While the orthodox Albanians were targets of hellenization, the muslim Albanians were either exterminated or expelled from their ancestral lands by the Greek government.

Chams who lived in Southern Epirus (Chameria or Thesprotia as it is called by the Greeks) were the victims of the first ethnic cleansing in Europe at the end of the Second World War. The Cham tragedy is one of the most painful tragedies of the European continent. Statistical yearbook of the Greek government in 1936 showed that 26.000 Chams lived in Chameria region in Greece at that time.

As a result of the 1944-1945 ethnic cleansing and genocide, 30.000 Albanian Muslims were violently expelled from the Chameria region, and sought refuge in the Republic of Albania, where they still live. Today, there are 150.000 members of this population in Albania, a figure that has grown because of the high birth rate of the population. On the other hand, current number of Cham Albanians living in Greece is estimated at around 100.000. Yet these people are deprived of every sort of minority rights like other minorities living in Greece. To cite but one example, they can speak Albanian only in their homes.

The population of Chameria has always been ethnically Albanian: - A lot of voyagers and foreign historians wrote that Chameria had been populated by Albanians. Even the Greek historian Herodotus underscored this fact in his book Historias and called Albanians of the Chameria barbarians, a term used by the ancient Greeks to distinguish non-greek people. - The census held by the Turkish Administration in 1910 established that there were 83.000 orthodox and muslim Albanians in the region. The demographic map of the British military mission sent to the British government in London indicates that on the eve of the second World War, 75% of Chameria's population was Albanian. - The pro-Greek historian Spiro Muselimi, in his book """"Historical Sight Through Thesprotia"""", edited in Joannina on 1974, wrote that """"The bishop of Thesprotia in the year 1870 translated some parts of Bible into Albanian, as the people of orthodox faith of the region did not understand any word in Greek"""" .

The Greek authorities, sticking to the concept of absolute denial of the existence of ethnic groups on Greek territory, have followed a well-established chauvinistic policy and, as history recorded, they committed genocide against the Albanians of muslim faith. The racial assault on Chameria's muslim Albanians began to be first applied at the end of the Second World War, in 1944-1945, when criminal bands of the notorious General Napoleon Zervas perpetrated ethnic cleansing against them.

On June 27, 1944, Greek criminal bands resorted to the worst atrocities witnessed in this region. The terror committed against this population was beyond description. It included killings, rapes, inhuman treatment, massacre of women, babies and pregnant women. More than 1400 men, women and children were killed within 24 hours in the town of Paramithy, on Tuesday, June 27, 1944, which happened to be the date of St.Bartholomeus day for the whole Chameria.

During the June 1944-March 1945 period, 1286 persons were killed in Filat, 192 people were killed",0,0,0,0,0,0

The link for """"Giant African Scops"""" gives the scientific name as Ptilopsis leucotis which refers to the Northern White-faced Owl, not the Southern, and since this link is right next to the link for Popo-chan, I assume that link must be intended to tell readers what kind of owl Popo-chan is.

Forwarding is the process of actually sending data. It depends on routing, but routing can occur without forwarding.

Routing does not depend on having an aggregatable address.  For example, prefixes blocks on the Internet today are becoming less aggregatable.  This is a problem for BGP's scalability, but it doesn't make BGP less of a routing protocol.  In fact, there exist routing protocols which need no concept of an address at all, such as ROFL , distributed hash tables, many ad hoc routing protocols like DSDV, and various proposals in a research area known as """"compact routing"""" . In these protocols nodes have unique names but not addresses.

There may be more narrow senses of the word """"routing"""", but for the purposes of this encyclopedia article, I would say bridging is a type of routing.

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

c27d6bc51ea4473b,"""The team was formed in 1977 by three ex-army motor cycle display team riders; Tony, Robin and Alan. Within a few weeks the team started building ramps and preparing motor cycles at Tony's workshop in Catford, S.E London.

New riders were trained for the first show which was at Mallory Park Race Track in Leicestershire. Early in 1978 preparations with George and Elstree Airport (North London) were made for Robin """"Smudger"""" Winter-Smith, to do a jump involving 31 Ford Escort vans. This along with a """"full team"""" stunt display took place on May 14th 1978. The jump was carried out successfully. Later that the team appeared on the ITV network's Saturday Banana Show, hosted by Bill Oddie, in which they performed stunts live on TV.

The team were then called upon to train Michael Crawford for an episode of his TV series """"Some Mothers' Do 'Ave 'Em."""" This episode was titled """"The Dispatch Ride,"""" Tony taught Michael some motor cycle tricks, in which Michael Performed very successfully. Tony also acted as a stunt coordinator while filming the show in 1978.

In 1980 team members worked on a film """"Silver Dream Racer."""" The star of this film was David Essex who was a very well known pop-star of this time. This year also saw two new members; John """"Golly"""" Goddard and Frank Welch, who were both training to jump with cars. 

In January 1982 the team along with """"Tina Roberts' Auto Angels"""" worked together, for """" Not The Nine O'Clock News """" which was a BBC TV programme. Both teams had a tremendous amount of fun whilst filming for the show. Tina now known as """"Firebird International"""" now travels and includes Pythons and singing with a band in her act. 
In May 1982 the team were performing in Brockley (South London). This was where John """"Golly"""" Goddard performed his first spectacular jump. He made a jump over 118 people laid down side by side. Later in the year on July 18th 1982 at the Chester Racecourse, John """"Golly"""" Goddard jumped successfully over 16 double decker buses , clearing a distance of 132ft. 

During the winter of 1982/3, Tony was busy working on a Kawasaki Z900 for a world record for """" 22 men on one motor cycle """". Once the bike was prepared the team and many friends went for the first practice. before the attempt was carried out many modifications were made. Once ready the team performed the event at the Santa Pod Raceway in Bedfordshire. The attempt was successful and placed the team into the Guinness Book of World Records. 
John """"Golly"""" Goddard was also preparing his next big jump, this time over 15 trucks. This successful jump took place on June 12th 1983 at Trentham Gardens, Staffordshire. 

The team took part in the """"Game For A Laugh"""" show hosted by Jeremy Beedle (amongst others) where the team's stunts were shown. John """"Golly"""" Goddard also successfully rode through 25 Walls of Fire for this programme. 

In 1989 Tony met Nikki, Nikki and her son James (9 at the time), they both became actively involved with the team, Nikki acting as a commentator and James began riding motor cycles and learning tricks on his PW 80. Lizzette Daniel and Sue Rees were female members of the team. 

In 1990 the team gained 2 World records. Chris """"Spin"""" Simpson set a new World record for 25 walls of fire; also Lee French jumped over 300 shopping trolleys at the Sussex County Showground, Ardingly, setting another new world record. 

Team members """" Vertical Vince """" and Chris Simpson started forming slow wheelies, Vertical Vince is probably the country's top rider performing wheelies. 

From 1992 Tony started to prepare a Suzuki Jeep for 2 wheel driving. After practicing for several weeks it was ready to perform in early 1993. Also 6 other Suzuki Jeeps were prepared for the team, for formation driving. This made the team unique as it was the only team performing this type of show. The next Jeep to be built was the """" Wheelie Jeep """" in 1995. In 1996 the """" Endo Jeep """" was built and this was driven by Tony for a challenge in the ITV programme """" You Bet"""". 

In 1998 Tony received a call from an agent with an unusual request for a motor cycle rider to promote a film by 20th Century Fox called """"Waking Ned"""". What made the request unusual was that they required a rider to to ride around Oxford Street, Trafalgar Square and Soho promoting the film,wearing nothing but a crash helmet and underpants . This was rather a chilly experience on a mid-September morning and this also received some very strange looks from people. 

Now the team performs 25-30 shows per year up and down the country. Tony and the team are busy with new ideas for the show. Brandon Bailey (Tony's son) just 9 years old already drives a Suzuki Jeep in the show, along with tricks on a motor cycle and a quad.

Lucky 6.9,
I noticed that you've speedied this (and one other) album while at the same time placing a brief comment on the user page.

Do you think that this was the best course of action?  I'd ask you to compare the message I left with yours, and also ask that you restore these stubs.  We want to encourage people to write good stubs, don't we?  Deleting it outright doesn't do that.

(t)(c) 

This came out bitchier than I intended, sorry.  With the """"no artist"""" stubs (which drive me crazy) I usually find that the person who created them edits the artist's page just before or after, and often add the link in myself.  Thanks for restoring those, (t)(c)

 Your message 

Hi, you left this message on my talk page:
Thanks for experimenting with Wikipedia. Your test worked, and has been reverted. Please use the sandbox for any other tests you want to do. Take a look at the welcome page if you would like to learn more about contributing to our encyclopedia. Thanks. - Lucky 6.9 

It's difficult to tell whether you are being sarcastic or are mistaken. What experiment? I cannot find any edits or original articles of mine that you have reverted.

Regards,
 

It's a shame you felt it necessary to revert as """"experimentation"""" what was obviously an article (albeit a stub). As you will see from my history, I am new to Wikipedia but have enjoyed creating and editing a number of articles about some fairly hefty topics. It occurred to me that someone who enjoys wikipedia (such as myself) ought to be referred to as a wikipedophile. A google search reveals no fewer than 132 instances of the word on the net. If other neologisms such as """"leet"""" are to have articles, why not this one? Why not at least leave the article there for others to discuss rather than annihilating it unilaterally?

 

So, you deleted my article because you decided not enough people would be interested in it? That's as good an argument for keeping the article: nobody interested, nobody sees it; someone interested, someone finds it. No harm done. QED. Ah, but in that case, no self-aggrandising administrator satisfaction, and no opportunity to post supercilious mesages about the sandbox. It is easier to destroy than to create. Enjoy.  

OK, I will leave the subject - it is hardly a fair argument when one of us has the power to silence the other on a whim - but as an admin you will perhaps wish to know that you have discouraged me from contributing further to Wikipedia. My brief edit history will show me a valuable contributor, and I had been inspired by the """"be bold in editing"""" tenet of Wikipedia. Alas, this spirit is evidently mired in the usual unaccountable, pseudopolitical hierarchies, fiefdoms and cliques that invariably beleaguer such online efforts. Adieu.

 Adaptively Reused churches and Former churches 

Hi Bencherlite, 
I've distinguished """"Adaptively Reused churches"""" from """"Former churches"""" because former churches could refer to any church building no longer used as a church, which would include demolition, closure, abandonment, ruin, etc. Adaptively Reused is an historic preservation / architectural conservation term for the reuse of a structure. For churches, this would include continuation as a church but for a different Christian denomination. Hope this clarifies that neither category is really a subcategory of each other, although they do heavily overlap. 
I believe some mistake were made. Thank you for catching the St. Cross and Hove articles

You know what, forget it. The guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here, because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why (except of course to start SHOUTING) has reported me for not being civil. How ironic is that. Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists. You do find out what Marco Rodríguez does for a living though. So yay for that. I guess once you get to the end, you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal, but that's assuming you haven't fallen asleep, or shot yourself, having read the same four words - Brazil, Germany, biggest & loss (and their million variants), multiple times. Seriously, if people here think what's currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way, perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. It's not quite garbage, but it's not good. And please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are """"unencyclopedic"""", frankly you couldn't be more wrong. There's no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation - that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match, both now and in 20 years time. If you don't want it to be in this one, please think of a better reason than """"unencyclopedic"""", if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.

That said, on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article, here's what the opening should look like, if you're trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.

Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.

I appreciate the computer's catching three syntax errors in the article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1st_Aerospace_Control_Squadron.  These have been around several years but it is good to know about them.

They occur in the lists of personnel at 1st Aero, their job descriptions (showing now jobs were defined and allocated to different ranks), and the courses offered as training in the development of the squadron's activities for the first formative years.  However, a few days ago, I had occasion to look at the article and saw that, last year, someone had removed all  this detailed personnel information except for the list of Squadron Commanders.  I restored this information recently, but it has again been removed with the comment by BB-PB

grossly excessive level of detail - none of these people are notable

It is a matter of opinion whether, as trackers of man-made satellite, people who have done things that have never before been done in human history are or are not notable.

Is there any way to appeal this decision on the grounds that the listing provides useful historical detail not available elsewhere about the organizational progress of early satellite tracking in the US?  My Ph.D. is in Management Theory so I think this is worthwhile information that should not be suppressed.

I removed the list of Commanders (as that is trivial compared to the other information) and inserted this remark):

""""The historical development of the Squadron is shown by detailed listings of personnel with dates and citations. However, a Wikipedia monitor refuses to allow this level of detail. Copies of the information are available on request from the author.""""
The list of commanders has again been restored, repacing my comment, and I have removed it as they are not notable  it is the workers who did something special.
But the commanders are again restored.

  in Number 

Hi Arthur,

I see in Number you have changed my additions of  to  with the edit summary that """"consensus seems to be that fractions are [used in this manner] in math articles"""".

I am more than happy to accept that; I changed them as part of the GA review because there was not specifically anything on the talk page to indicate this consensus, so defaulted to MoS. Could you please point me to the consensus of which you speak?

I have no doubt you are right; I myself was a little surprised that this had not come up before. A comment about the consensus at the GA review would be very handy, and I am more than happy to accept it.

Incidentally I've raised the subject at Wikipedia Talk:Manual of style (dates and numbers) as it seems to me that all it says is to put fractions in """"fractional form"""" without defining what that is, and even in the section WP:MOSNUM#Fractions only says what to do about common fractions, which leaves us high and dry dealing with other fractions – for myself I would not regard  as a common fraction, for example.

 2008 BATTLE of KODORI 

Abkhaz separatists strike disputed Georgia gorge

Posted 11 hours 29 minutes ago

Abkhazia has said it has launched an operation to drive Georgia out of a disputed gorge, possibly opening a """"second front"""" in Tbilisi's battle to retain fractious breakaway regions.

The separatist foreign minister Sergei Shamba said Abkhazian artillery and warplanes struck Georgian forces in Kodori, a narrow gorge which cuts deep into the Abkhazian territory and is an ideal route for any invasion in the region.

The attack came less than 48 hours after Georgia sent troops to retake the breakaway province of South Ossetia, triggering an invasion of Russian forces dispatched to restore the status quo.

""""Abkhazian forces, in response to the Georgian aggression against South Ossetia, have started a military operation the Kodori gorge to clear it from illegal Georgian troops,"""" Mr Shamba told Reuters.

Mr Shamba said at midday (local time) Abkhaz warplanes launched airstrikes at the Tbilisi-controlled upper part of the Gorge and artillery was pounding the area.

""""Today was only the initial part of the operation by heavy artillery supported by aviation,"""" Mr Shamba said.

Georgians denied an all-out Abkhaz attack and said they were ready to face down any aggression.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

What we are discussing is that the direct NATO combat involvement phase of the overall Afghan civil war (1979-present) has ended and a new phase has begun just like previously you had: the Soviet phase, the Fall of the communist government, the inter-factional fighting, than the Taliban phase, than the NATO phase (which we are discussing) and now we have a totally new phase of the conflict where the Afghan government takes the lead and NATO and US remnants have a secondary role.   23:24, 8",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Is everything kosher, and Sophia is ready to be WP:BOLD in mainspace now?  
 As I understand it, Phil her manager in the UK *is* still blocked, save from editing his own talkpage to discuss unblocking procedures. 
 Due to tech-related difficulties with inability to type colons (perhaps he edits from a tablet with no physical keyboard?), and because he did some impersonation of Sophia and some creation of new usernames for evasion-and-or-socking, Phil may need to wait for the Usual Six Months prior to requesting an unblock of his User:Welshmusiclover account, should he wish to return to wikipedia and get himself back into wikipedian-in-good-standing status.  
 I believe that Sophia can, if she so wishes, give Phil some pointers on the wiki-rules, and on the use of talkpages, and other such topics, which will immensely improve Phil's chances of getting his own username unblocked.  
 But they should both read WP:MEATPUPPET very carefully, so that they don't cross the wiki-rules against socking and puppetry and making edits on behalf of other people.  
 Sophia should exclusively use her own newly-cleansed user-account User:Sophia Giroux-Radisch, and not only should nobody else use it directly, nobody else should use it *indirectly* either.  
 On the other reason for her old user-account and Phil's current user-account being blocked, Sophia should be aware at all times that wikipedia is not a vehicle for self-promotion.  
 This includes herself, her albums, her movies, and so on, plus also her other clients and her co-workers at rock Solid Talent Entertainment (not to mention the corporate entity itself), as well as her relatives and friends.

Here is a featured article about a Candide that uses the Further reading section just the way it is used here. Actually, there are two books in that section. There are also a few relevant academic articles and all the remaining relevant reviews that were published in English.

About the Einsaztgruppen, you should go back to the wiki article you tried to use against me and read it again. Nowhere it says that they were under orders of the Wehrmacht, but that they were in close cooperation. I'll quote it for you: Each Einsatzgruppe was led by SD, Gestapo and Kripo officers, and its members included recruits from the Orpo, the Waffen-SS, and local volunteers, such as militia groups. Each death squad followed the Wehrmacht Heer (German Army) as it advanced eastwards through Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union. During the course of their operations, the Einsatzgruppen commanders were authorized to request, and did receive, assistance from the Wehrmacht. Heydrich acted under orders from Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler who supplied security forces on an """"as needed"""" basis to the local SS and Police Leaders. They were different organizations. The Wehrmacht could not give order to the SS. Again, from that article: The Einsatzgruppen were formed under the direction of SS-Obergruppenführer Reinhard Heydrich (deputy to Heinrich Himmler) and operated by the Schutzstaffel (SS) before and during World War II. From September 1939 forward the SS-Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA – Reich Main Security Office)[4] had overall command of the Einsatzgruppen.

What Littell does is to make the picture unclear by saying that the Wehrmacht worked too closely with the Einsaztgruppen. The following passage is singular in that respect: “I don’t understand. Who should we take our orders from, in the end? From Reichenau or Jeckeln? And where is Brigadeführer Rasch?”—“I don’t know, Sturmbannführer.”. I suggest changing """"attached"""" to """"worked closely with"""", """"cooperated"""" or something like that.

As for the sentence the Sixth Army, the AOK 6, to which we were attached, Littell originally used the verb """"rattacher"""", auquel nous étions rattachés, which is usually translated as """"linked"""", """"connected"""" or """"associated"""". By translating it to """"attached"""", it took away the double entendre in Littell original text.

Unfortunately, we'll have to disagree about the image.

Even if Miles didn't interview anybody, Blume still did and he still came to the same conclusions so your point is absolutely moot. Your criticism is REALLY getting ridiculous here. Miles already says what the primary reason is (ethnic hatred), and one must assume that he had to talk to people in Lhasa to find out why, otherwise he would've made the same conclusion that you and many other misinformed do - that the riots were for nationalism/independence. The fact that the rumours of monks getting killed angered the residents and helped start the riots is already mentioned in the article. Not to mention that I ALREADY ADDRESSED THAT POINT OF YOURS. So what if monks getting killed is part of the reason why riots started?

Until you actually find that someone in Lhasa being interviewed complaining about wanting independence or autonomy, or any evidence that the Tibetans rioted out of nationalism, besides your own presumptuous interpretations, then I advise you to drop the issue because you seem downright biased and unreasonable right now. Sorry, to say but the evidence is stacked against your view. Last, no one said it was all about the rising prices. If you read the article, it clearly states that the riots occurred for several reasons, of which only one was inflation. So basically, YOU ARE JUST SPECULATING. You cannot just include your own, personal opinions and interpretations into the article. The fact is that the reporters who were there actually described what the residents were complaining about, and at the very least, offered their professional interpretation of what the riots were about (James Miles), which is supported by their interviews with the residents of what they were complaining about.216.252.71.154

 Israeli-Palestinian conflict protect? 

Yesterday there were relevent and reliably-sourced casualty figures added to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict article, and some editors objected to this. It seems you were called in to quickly """"protect"""" the page from editing, effectively blocking the inclusion of the figures. You cited """"edit warring,"""" the more accurate term would be repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons. There are casualty figures in all the conflict, war, battle etc. Wiki articles I have referenced, why not this one? Thanks   
RomaC, the edits which you tried to make were a set of statistics for one year only, which you attemepted to place in the first paragraph of an article describing a conflict of over sixty years. This article covers an issue of extreme sensitivity and complexity. The fact that your edits sparked so much conflict and opposition speaks for itself. Here at Wikipedia, we value the ability to achieve consensus, and to be fair to many viewpoints. And believe it or not, we often do achieve that at the article Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is not enough to disinegnuously claim that your figures were """"reliable,"""" without addressing any of the underlying issues, or any of the conflicts which it clearly and immediately caused. 

To repeat: statistics for just one year of the conflict do not belong anywhere in the article's lead. there are a wide variety of figures which either side could quote, all in the name of objectivity, which would clear and unacceptably attempt to create a slant towards one side or the other. please note, this is why we are careful when making edit to be sure that we actually have consensus, rather than simply telling others that they should provide consensus.   

I strongly object to your calling me """"disinegnuous"""" [sic]. You wrote on the article talk page that you agreed with Hertz1888, who argued that the statistics might be biased. Do you not regard Haaretz as a reliable source? Please explain more clearly why you feel that citing reliably-sourced and up-to-date civilian casualty statistics in an article about a war, battle or conflict is disingenuous. If you or any other editor want to add more statistics, covering a longer time period, then go ahead, but do not delete relevant content added by other editors. Yes, the edit """"sparked so much conflict and opposition"""" but note also also that here at Wikipedia we do not determine what is """"fair"""" through intimidation by numbers. There is a big difference between consensus and false compromise.   

I apologize if you felt I was offending you in any way. i only meant to describe the appearance of your edits, not to describe you personally in any way. if other editors deleted some edits, it is because they genuinely felt there was a reason to do so, and that the material was not beneficial or fair to the article. I responded to your concerns and issues further at the article talk page. thanks.    

Apology accepted, and I will also make my further comments on the article talk page. I am not a single-issue editor I get around a bit on Wiki, saw the Haaretz report and very much believe it is something very relevant to the article. I can't say I know for certain why other editors deleted the material, I try to assume good faith, we'll see.   
""""repeated reverts from those who did not like the figures for political reasons"""" - motive doesn't really matter, its still edit warring, its still disruptive. Protection is not an endorsement of the current version. Z-man 
The subject of this article is a deadly conflict, the lede is huge - and yet it contains no mention of the casualties. Clearly, there is something seriously wrong. As a result, your action here, while well-intentioned, looks highly partisan. Worse than that, it looks rather like like a cynical move to protect deniers, those who wish to cover up atrocities, the mass killings of (mostly) unarmed civilians, in many cases recognised by Western sources as war-crimes. If the events at this article really offend you, it would be a lot better to lock it at the alternative version. talk 10:39,",0,0,0,0,0,0

New article
I'm reluctant to add this as an external link because of the unnecessarily sensationalist title and free use of the c-word and questions about the sincerity/legitimacy of RS. But it does seem interesting to see this conclusion in this publication and it does seem of relevance to where this """"movement"""" is today. I wonder if there are other less offensive sources for the same opinion:
We need to remember CyberFeminism. We need draw VNS Matrix up from the depths and inject a little into our veins. It’s good medicine. These women’s voices—weird, angry, hilarious, and staunchly defiant of the (Big Daddy) Mainframe—are sorely missing from today’s many fractured conversations about feminism in online spaces. For every screed about “ethics in gaming journalism,” for every dismissal of women’s legitimate grievances about their portrayal in gaming or treatment in online comment sections, for every death threat or doxxing attempt lodged against a woman online, I long for the howling future cunts to come along and rattle some sense into the servers.

It's not enough for you to argue, however strenuously, that this work is really important.  You instead must cite reliable, independent sources (what are those?  see WP:V) to support the claims.

I use to think this was a 4 man rr, but found out it was 8 man with 2 groups of 4 earlier this year. There were some upsets at this event with Ralston  beating Rosewall on clay.  On the 1963 results I am slightly suspicious of Laver winning twice by the same score 6-0, 6-3 at MSG; once in the 6 man phase and once in the final play-off phase.

Image hints...
Hello!

Thanks for uploading some pictures to Wikipedia.  I wanted to make sure you were aware of some of the requirements and good practices for uploaded images.

Pick an image name.
When uploading an image, pick a file name that is descriptive, and unique.  Remember that many images may be uploaded about the same topic, and remember that names are case sensitive.

Source the image.
On the image description page, explain where the image came from.  If you created the image yourself, then say so.  If it's from the web, give a URL.  If it's a screenshot of a movie or game, or a scan from a book, give the title.

Provide copyright and license information.
This part is a little bit trickier, but it's very important.  The copyright of the image generally belongs to whomever created it.
If it's a photograph you took, or an image you created (modifying an image that already exists doesn't count) in software like Photoshop or GIMP, then you own the copyright.  To upload it to Wikipedia, you must agree to license it under the GFDL (which allows anyone to use it, but requires that they give credit to the original author and requires that any further edit to the image be licensed under the GFDL as well) or release it into the public domain (which allows anyone to use it for any purpose without restriction.)  Do this by placing an appropriate tag on the image description page, like {{GFDL}} or {{PD}}.  Be sure to mention that you created the image.  If you're using {{PD}}, you may also want to use {{NoRightsReserved}}, since there is some dispute as to whether one may grant items into the public domain.
If you didn't create the image, or the copyright somehow belongs to another party (like a screenshot, which you might """"create"""", but the copyright belongs to the author of the movie or video game), then you need to find another tag that describes the copyright status of the image.  Images used on Wikipedia need to be free for our use and the use of sites which reproduce our content.  This means that images cannot have a restriction such as """"only for use by Wikipedia"""", or """"for non-commercial use only"""", or """"for educational use"""".  Images without a free license may be usable in certain articles under fair use, but such a use should be justified on the image description page.

Describe the image.
To another reader, the image may not be immediately understood.  A caption in an article doesn't explain the image to a visitor who sees it on its image page.  Put a brief explanation of what is in the image on the image description page, similar to what you might include in a caption on an article.

My point is that contrary to certain media outlets using the term for commercial advantage as well as fans of RFC 1872 clinging to a fiction the 'Club never really died', the term 'Old Firm' can only be in existence when both Club's the term was used to describe are also both in existence.

 Edit war brewing at Yosemite National Park 

If you have some spare energy, please come and lend a hand. Thanks! —  

Looked ... acted ... )   

I was also approached recently with regards to possible edits to the Yosemite National Park article. My input on the matter can be found at the following link;
user talk:Edit Centric#Hantavirus Risk in Yosemite

Noted,   

 Thmc1 / 173.63.176.93 sill sockpuppeting / REPLYU REQUSTED 

This person (blocked sockmaster Thmc1) is still block evading by not logging in, even after he was warned by SysAdmin Kudpung. I would suggest that you block the suspected IPs(173.63176.93, 74.88.160.244) as well as IPs used by his other blocked account (Nyc88) and any other accounts affiliated w/them. Why are sockppuppets of a blocked sockmaster still allowed to edit even after ample warnings? To make matters worse, he even violated his block and continuted editing the day after he was blocked! Please see Thmc1 sockpuppet investigation archive for latest investigation/evidence.   

No clue  links would be helpful.   

Actually I think it's the other way around, if I'm not mistaken, I think I remember   being mentioned to admin Ronhjones as a possible sockpuppet in the past few months in conjunction with an edit disagreement issue. Are you stocking this address? Is this some sort of retaliation? First of all, I have no idea who any of these other users are, much less others who use this IP address. 173.63.176.93  
Hmm... Thanks, I think, hadn't noticed the 173... above was the same as the 173... I just talked to .. still no clue why MBaxter showed up here. Aw well - keep on keepin' on   

Vsmith- Don't let 173.63.176.93 fool you. It was him who attempted to mention this to RonHJones using IP 74.88.160.244. That IP was found to be one of 173.63.176.93's sockpuppet and blocked after a recent investigation. 173.63.176.93 is actually a sockpuppet of Thmc1, blocked for excessive sockpuppeting back in 2010. Even though 173.63.176.93 was ruled most likley as one of Thmc1's sockpuppet, he was let off with a warning. For the full story, I suggest that you check out Thmc1's most recent investigation, August 2012. The final assessment was one account (Nyc88) permanently blocked, one IP temporarily blocked, and one left open with warning. If he causes you anymore trouble, you should report this to the SysAdmins and don't hesitate to mention the sockpuppet investigation. The reverting of your edits is the same kind of BS he conducted on the London City article that got him blocked back in 2010. He has an anti-UK bias amongst many, and you can confirm this with user Eraserhead1.   —Preceding undated comment added  

Hantavirus
VSmith, I actually came to your talk page for a different reason and just happened to notice this. It looks ridiculous and I think this MBaxter1 character is highly suspicious himself. In the meantime, can you please look at this story seen on the main CNN.com page today? http://www.cnn.com/2012/09/05/health/hantavirus-warnings/index.html?hpt=hp_t1
I think that this Yosemite hantavirus story is worthy of at least brief mention in the article because it is now having international implications. I just don't see a justification in ignoring it completely, thanks.173.63.176.93

Hi, John
Regarding your recent message about """"Naked"""", my edit is based on the character's arguable status as an anti-hero. It becomes apparent to me that Leigh's intention was to portray someone who, while probably hailing from a higher academic milieu or background (whether conventional or self-taught) uses his eloquence and education in an deliberately overbearing manner.

 Harry Potter and the Deathly Printing-house 

Daily Mirror and other media report that a quarter million copies of """"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"""", the seventh and final installment in J. K. Rowling's fantasy series are being printed in the small german town of Poessneck near the czech border. According to locals the security measures introduced in and around the GGP print factory resemble those at the height of Cold War. Employees under threats of fines had to sign secret contracts and are body and vehicle searched after every workday. What's more, to prevent them reading or copying the book they have to work in PITCH DARK!

I simply cannot imagine the work safety implications of this. In a high-capacity printing house machines 15 feet across unfold one-ton rolls of paper at several dozen miles an hour. Have a hand or piece of apprel entangled and it will rip out your whole arm and you are dead! How could anyone work in the dark with such equipment?

Supposedly the European Union is notable for its focus on workplace safety - but now it looks like for profits we have almost degraded to the level of black Africa, where underpaid diamond miners are x-rayed every day for body cavity contraband, without regards for their radiation exposure. I'd say it is no longer Voldemort who should be public enemy no.1, but rather that Lord Franchise.

ad0df042c6d8e49b,"""As a result of the massacre in Boston, Parliament began to consider a motion to partially repeal the Townshend duties.[3] Most of the new taxes were repealed, but the tax on tea was retained. The British government continued in its attempt to tax the colonists without their consent and the Boston Tea Party and the American Revolution followed.

Following the Seven Years War 1756–1763, the British Empire was deep in debt. To help pay some of the costs of the newly expanded empire, the Parliament of Great Britain/British Parliament decided to levy new taxes on the colonies of British America. Previously, through the Trade and Navigation Acts, Parliament had used taxation to regulate the trade of the empire. However, with the Sugar Act of 1764, Parliament sought for the first time to tax the colonies for the specific purpose of raising revenue. American colonists initially objected to the Sugar Act for economic reasons, but before long they recognized that there were constitutional issues involved.

It was argued that the Bill of Rights 1688 protected British subjects from being taxed without the consent of a truly representative Parliament. Because the colonies elected no members of the British Parliament, many colonists viewed Parliament's attempt to tax them as a violation of the constitutional doctrine of taxation only by consent. Some British politicians countered this argument with the theory of """"virtual representation"""", which maintained that the colonists were in fact represented in Parliament even though they elected no members. This issue, only briefly debated following the Sugar Act, became a major point of contention following Parliament's passage of the 1765 Stamp Act. The Stamp Act proved to be wildly unpopular in the colonies, contributing to its repeal the following year, along with the lack of substantial revenue being raised.

Implicit in the Stamp Act dispute was an issue more fundamental than taxation and representation: the question of the extent of Parliament's authority in the colonies.[4] Parliament provided its answer to this question when it repealed the Stamp Act in 1766 by simultaneously passing the Declaratory Act, which proclaimed that Parliament could legislate for the colonies """"in all cases whatsoever"""".[5]

Townshend's program
Raising revenue

The first of the Townshend Acts, sometimes simply known as the Townshend Act, was the Revenue Act of 1767.[6] This act represented the Chatham ministry's new approach for generating tax revenue in the American colonies after the repeal of the Stamp Act in 1766.[7] The British government had gotten the impression that because the colonists had objected to the Stamp Act on the grounds that it was a direct (or """"internal"""") tax, colonists would therefore accept indirect (or """"external"""") taxes, such as taxes on imports.[8] With this in mind, Charles Townshend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, devised a plan that placed new duties on paper, paint, lead, glass, and tea that were imported into the colonies.[9] These were items that were not produced in North America and that the colonists were only allowed to buy from Great Britain.[10]

The British government's belief that the colonists would accept """"external"""" taxes resulted from a misunderstanding of the colonial objection to the Stamp Act. The colonists' objection to """"internal"""" taxes did not mean that they would accept """"external"""" taxes; the colonial position was that any tax laid by Parliament for the purpose of raising revenue was unconstitutional.[8] """"Townshend's mistaken belief that Americans regarded internal taxes as unconstitutional and external taxes constitutional"""", wrote historian John Phillip Reid, """"was of vital importance in the history of events leading to the Revolution.""""[11] The Townshend Revenue Act received the royal assent on 29 June 1767.[12] There was little opposition expressed in Parliament at the time. """"Never could a fateful measure have had a more quiet passage"""", wrote historian Peter Thomas.[12]

The Revenue Act was passed in conjunction with the Indemnity Act of 1767,[13] which was intended to make the tea of the British East India Company more competitive with smuggled Dutch tea.[14] The Indemnity Act repealed taxes on tea imported to England, allowing it to be re-exported more cheaply to the colonies. This tax cut in England would be partially offset by the new Revenue Act taxes on tea in the colonies.[15] The Revenue Act also reaffirmed the legality of writs of assistance, or general search warrants, which gave customs officials broad",0,0,0,0,0,0

In Feb. 2014, a Walmart department manager writing a long letter published in Gawker stated, """"home office gives store managers a set amount of hours and payroll dollars that they can schedule people/pay people in each area of the store, and it is based on what the sales were in that department on that day the previous fiscal year.

A Walmart Worker Explains Why Walmart's Customer Service Is Horrible, Gawker, Hamilton Nolan, Feb. 11, 2014.

On reflection, I just have a hard time believing this.  I'm sorry.  You mean Walmart really doesn't take into account whether it's a Friday with medium customers vs. a Saturday with a lot of customers ? ?  So, this guy is a department manager.  His job is to lead his or her team and kept the assigned area stocked and put back together after customers tear it up, to be frank about it.  Just as a guess, I think Walmart probably does have more cashiers on a Saturday.  Okay, so a customer is shopping and wants to know where something is.  So, the employee is not thrilled about helping the customer because the employee up to and including the department manager is just going to later get criticized for not getting more work done.

I'll have to take a closer look at the current version of the article, because I have an uneasy feeling that the answer actually is found in one of the subsidiary articles, such as Lydian mode. The short answer is that the connection between the Greek harmoniai and the medieval modes is more tenuous than you appear to believe, and the connection between medieval and modern modes is fairly straightforward. The """"modern system"""" is actually that of Common Practice Tonality, and """"modal"""" usage within that context begins to establish itself as a separate idea during the 18th century. The chief difference from medieval practice is a more rigid adherence to the diatonic notes of the scale. For example, in the medieval system, there is no practical difference between the Lydian scale and what we call the major scale, or between the Dorian and what we call the minor scale. In order to differentiate """"modal flavor"""" from the chromatic flexibility of the upper half of the minor scale, for example, it became necessary to insist on always using the minor-seventh scale degree, especially in ascent to the tonic, and the sixth degree had to be always major to identify Dorian, and always minor to identify Aeolian. No such practice existed up to the 16th century, and indeed it was only with Glareanus in the mid-16th century that a theoretical difference was made between Dorian and Aeolian on the one hand, and Lydian and Ionian on the other.

For example passages such as 'he has exceptional dribbling ability, fantastic technique, he likes to cut inside onto his stronger left foot' are clear, direct observations of Messi's playing style for some years. This is confusing for me as of why you had deleted my post as some other users send me a message saying how that it was very helpful and detailed. Also, concerning the evidence problem, would you please kindly replace the passage I wrote because it is not a biased passage and clearly reflects Messi's playing style, I have also used what other commentators have frequently said and if you have ever watched a match with Messi weaving his magic you will know and surely agree along with the millions who watch him that this is a very descriptive, accurate passage about his playing style.
I am very hurt by your edit and deletion and I would ask you to kindly replace this text as it took me a very long time to write. If not, please tell me why or let me speak to someone else who could advise me or who would think I am justified

59e85959ecfbfa30,"Kid Lantern Question
I was the person to contribute the Kid Lantern article to the Waly West page.  Would it be more appropriate as trivia/note?  Sure it's not world shattering info but it's still encyclopedia material.  I believe that all info on articles are improtant whether they're big or small.

My Kid Lantern artcile, take a look at it:

Issue 3 of the miniseries Flash & Green Lantern: The Brave And The Bold has Flash, Kid Flash and Green Lantern in pursuit of Mirror Master and Black Hand.  In an attempt to steal Flash's speed, it is Kid Flash who loses his powers.  To help out, Green Lantern creates a temporary Power Ring for Wally to use, dubbing him Kid Lantern (With a costume, identical to Hal's.  Wally's head piece resembles his Kid Flash uniform).

Yes it's minor information, but does it contain the following?:

Vandalisim
Original Research
POV

No it does not.

And I'm not so much upset about the deletion, but your reasoning.  In all of your time on wikipedia, do you ever help make someones eidt more appropriate?  By that I mean things like moving it somewhere else on the article, fixing/adjusting, anything other than deleting?

Keep in mind, following the rules doesn't mean always having to dump on other wikipedian or using them as stepping stones.

Obviously NOT from anything outside of that, in the way of secular authorities etc.   And yeah, of course YOU (as well as I) are going around in circles, because you keep rowing with one oar, making me do so too in a way.   I was merely answering your question (which I was a little surprised why you asked it) of what I meant by """"believed-to-be historical"""", as you seemed to think I was meaning (for some reason) that it was from any outside source.   That's not what I meant.    As far as the """"theological reasons"""" the point too is why would they be so """"vested"""" if they didn't believe it was the actual actual actual genuine historical date to begin with?    That makes no sense.   It's all TIED IN, was my point.   And also, if it was """"587"""" instead of """"607"""" (according to the whole """"2520 years"""" view, which I know you don't believe as an atheist or whatever, but again from THEIR perspective) we'd still be living in the """"last days"""" anyway.  Instead of it starting in 1914, it would be 1934.   So side point, we'd still be in the """"end times"""" if that's the case.    But again, not to digress too much, I was simply answering your question, even though I thought that the discussion was already over.   You were not sure what I meant by """"believed-to-be historical date"""" not just solely """"theological"""".   The WT believes it to be the accurate true date as a point of general history.  And because of the whole """"Gentile Times"""" thing (as you know of course) for the whole """"Messiah's Kingdom"""" breaking in for the """"end times"""" etc etc.    It's whatever.  I was addressing your question, that was it.  And yes, I noticed your addition in the other discussion, and your contention that they """"mis-translated"""" Jeremiah 25.29, when they didn't, because seeing other translations they say """"I begin"""" or """"I am beginning"""" it does NOT say what you said of """"already beginning"""".   There's no real difference between the word """"beginning"""" and """"start of"""".    THAT'S THE POINT.     It says """"I am starting off"""".   You could easily claim even with the NWT rendering that God """"already started off"""".   So?    Because in all versions the word """"already"""" is NOT there.   Whether you use the word """"beginning"""" or """"start"""".   Also, I'm a little confused as to what your point is, either way, wheether the words are """"already beginning"""" or """"first"""" or """"starting off"""".   Because if it's """"already beginning"""" as you said, wouldn't that ALSO be (obviously) before the other nations anyway?   The point is that all versions is obviously that Jerusalem would have evil caused by God to BEGIN with with, before the other nations.    Why would He say """"I am beginning with you"""" (as other versions have it, which makes the point too)?

I think that Kintetsubuffalo/Chris has a good point when he says that the article """"reads more like a family genealogy"""", but I don't think that the solution is to trim out the less notable people.   On the contrary, they have a place in the story of the family, but the significance of their role intends up being uninentionally overstated by the article's structure.
The genealogy is clearly an important part of the article, but I suggest that it should be at the bottom of the article, in the place where an appendix would be in a book. What the article needs, I suggest, is a clear narrative,  telling of the story of the family's activities. That could be done either thematically (e.g. politics, medicine, industry) or chronologically, or maybe by a combination of both approaches.
Vernon has clearly done a lot of excellent research, and has plenty of useful material with which to tell the story here, and I would really enjoy reading the story once it's written up.  I have been looking for a few articles which might serve as examples of how this might be done, and found a few which might help:
Rothschild banking family of England (the best I found)
Bulmer (family) (a much weaker article but it tells a story)
Mitford family (narrative a bit short, but heading in the right direction)
German sisters (more integrated than the Mitfords)
Smalbroke family (chronologially ordered, and somewhat genealogical in focus, but does tell a story)

He does this by inflating the casualty figures listed. He has used several methods to do this. Firstly, by changing the numbers given by sourced material, thereby falsifying it. Secondly, by inventing sources and or/citing them falsely. He refuses to engage with other users when asked detailed questions about this behaviour, but instead makes personal attacks (specifically calling users loyalist paramilitary supporters) and threatens to get other editors banned from wikipedia. This behaviour has been going on for nearly a year now and is hugely disruptive to the articles in question. This is not only due to the factual inaccuracies and POV he inserts, but also because his reverts delete all the work done on the articles since his previous edits. Additionally, his constant reverts have had the effect of re-posting copyrgiht material that had been removed. Finally, Devin79 has also defamed a living person, Irish journalist Henry McDonald, although he has not engaged in revert wars there when his edits were removed. Jdorney 

The most serious aspect of this dispute, in my opinion, is edits such as [2]. Devin79 alters properly cited figures (from BBC News [3]) about the Provisional IRA's weapons arsenal. This change was made not only without providing a reference for the different numbers, but without changing the reference itself. So the article was left in a highly unsatisfactory state where it contradicted its own references, and this has been done several times over the past few months [4] [5]. Not only has Devin79 not responded to attempts by myself and other editors to engage with him on the talk page [6], but he announced his intention to keep on reverting regardless [7]. Demiurge 

These accusations are completely false, and slanderous. Every single edit I have done of the PIRA article is based on a number of sources all of which have been cited in the article edits, and source page. Jdorney has infested this article with innacuracies and outright lies, due to his biasd view of the IRA. The edits I made are proven and the proof was cited again and again. I even gave him specific information on how to find this info, which not surprisingly he ignored. Jdorney is an arrogant little punk, he has no idea what makes a good article and is an example of why Wikipedia is ridiculed in academic circles. I have access to several other IP addresses, and I will be using them to continue to edit the sad, amateurish work of this biased little loser. 

All of the above is also relevant to Jdorney's girlfriend SWATJester. SWATJester wouldn't know anything about the SAD if it slapped him upside the head. Having served 4 years as a Force Recon Marine, I would argue that I am far more knoweldgeable about this particular subject then some basement dweller who runs around calling himself """"SwatJester"""".

 Ettlinger Being Jewish + His Family 

Hi all,

I learned about Adrian’s death after a web search yielded this Wikipedia article (see my post of """"In Memoriam"""" about him to the Freecell Solving Discussions mailing list), and since he was a good Internet friend of mine, and we corresponded extensively on E-mail, I’d like to help with the English Wikipedia article about him. In any case, Ettlinger told me in a private E-mail that he was Jewish (at least by descent - he wasn’t an observant/religious Jew and said something about being a deist), and so I think his article should be added to the American Jews by occupation category. One problem I see there is that I don't see any sub-category for Jewish American Engineers and/or Jewish American software developers (he was both). I know that Richard Stallman is a Jewish (also only by decent) American software developer, and he belongs to the categories """"American computer programmers"""" and """"American Jews"""" and there are naturally many others. I have kept most of the E-mails with him, so can upload them in part to my web-site or elsewhere for citation, nut will it be considered a self-reference? So what should be done?

Adrian also told me about his family (two children if I remember correctly, and four or five grandchildren, all but one are attending university now), but I don't think he mentioned any names. Should they be mentioned as well?

09eb9dde2675d5a7,"""::Dearest Danny, I see you have not replied to any of the points put forward in my criticism of your obsessive use of propaganda, unfounded accusations, slander, and your ad hominem attacks to name but a few of your methods. I herby challenge you to take three different examples from either of Raymond Franz's two books, and prove to us using evidence contained in the books that he is """"a bitter apostate, vindictive liar, makes inaccurate claims, and writes incorrect material about JWs, or the Watch Tower's Governing Body"""" as you claim. If you cannot do this, then you should permanently remove yourself, and be barred from Wikipedia, as you have demonstrated, hypocrisy, slander and defamation of character, negative grossly subjective propaganda and multiple lies, all of which discredit your character, and your editing scruples as virtually worthless, and indubitably of no value as a contributor to Wikipedia, as you have proven over and over that you feel content to destroy someone's character (Franz's in this case), his motives, his books, and all without reading a single page of his written material. If someone did the same about Jehovah's Witnesses books, you would be outraged, disgusted, and we would never hear the end to it, you definitely would not stand for it. You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz. YOU Danny Muse, are in NO position to speak, as you have not even read a single book by Raymond Franz, and so have completely and permanently revoked your right to speak, edit, or comment on the matter, of which you have admitted ZERO knowledge about him, his motives, his life or about his books and their Wikepedia entries, which you have the audacity to claim are """"inaccurate"""", and yet you have zero basis for this false claim, but you still cling to it like a rabid Pit bull. Give it up Danny; you are biting at your own air filled fantasies and straw men. Wishing you well, and I hope you come back down to reality soon. Kind regards Central.

 Skepticism regarding the existence of ISIS 

Hi there.  Perhaps I'm behind the times though I do try to keep up with the """"news"""" and with """"global"""" events, but, I get the feeling that ISIS does not really exist.  Just as there is an excellent chance that Al-Qaeda does not really exist.  I was especially inspired to post this comment when I saw in the first paragraph of this article use the neologism """"jihadist"""".  It doesn't take much brain power to know that there is no one in the world, besides maybe a few deeply stupid solo acts who keep up with thew western media, who refer to themselves as """"jihadists"""".  That is a habit of english speaking people to combine two words from different languages -in this case, arabic and english.  Similarly, there is no centralized organization known as the Taliban, no organization or action known as """"Islamist"""" no organization known as al-Qaeda.  Notice also, that even the purported mission of """"ISIS"""" is not Islamic in its nature.  I know what folks want to ask: then how is it that words like jihadist, islamist, taliban, al-qaeda, and ISIS exist?  Its called orientailsim.  The Palestinian scholar Edward Said wrote extensively on the history of english speaking people, and other imperialists, who purposely attack and misrepresent Muslim peoples.  It started with the Crusades.  I don't mean to be a no it all, but ought we just believe what we are told?  Is there a way to find empirical evidence that they do exist?  If they do exist -what are we talking about?  A few people who never studied Shariah in the first place.   10 August, 2014""",0,0,0,0,0,0

   The treatment options for prostate cancer depend in part on your age, your overall health and whether the tumor has spread. For tumors that are still inside the prostate, radiation therapy (using x-rays that kill the cancer cells) and a surgery called radical prostatectomy are common treatment options. """"Watchful waiting"""" is also a treatment option. In this approach, no treatment is given until the tumor gets bigger. Watchful waiting may be the best choice for an older man who has a higher risk of dying from something other than his prostate cancer.

You would think that academic journals have taken over Wikipedia. The idea that I have actually improved the article with my additions, and that others can improve it further, has completely escaped much of the Wikipedia culture these days.

You are standing on the shoulders of millions of edits and now you reject the very thing that got you to where you are, namely lots of collaboratively edited small improvements.

Hi , the new section title sounds good to me, but I'm still in favor of removing the Charles Taylor quote.  It makes Mr. Taylor appear like a living legend, which perhaps he is, but it's odd that he's not referred to in such glowing terms on his own Wikipedia article (or maybe not: it's a very contentious statement from a periodical, not a person).  The second part of the quote seems like empty praise to me, not really encyclopedia grade material.  Neither part passes the sniff test, so I removed it again.

Also, from your comment, it appears that you think the article is unbalanced because positive material is not being included.  Is that what you think, that there is not enough positive material about Mr. Wilber in the article?  I thought the whole goal was NPOV, neither positive nor negative, just the facts.

 Template:Cfd2 

I see you've reverted SPUI on this template - however, his version had support on the talk page. I can understand you're a bit grumpy with SPUI at the moment, but I'd appreciate if you'd check the talk pages before reverting. In this particular instance, SPUI's suggestion was bang on the money. CfD is not a vote, and the template formatting isn't helping with that. The Cfd template itself is often useful for situations where """"this category is rubbish, we need to rescope it or merge it into something else or just plain delete it (oh, and if you really do want to keep it, it still needs to be renamed)"""" that degenerating it into a keep vs delete thing (with all the horrid prospects of vote-counting) is not the wisest of ideas. I won't re-revert you (unless you agree to em doing so) because that's not my style, but at the time you did revert, SPUI had favored the change and I had concurred with him on the talk page, so I think consensus (at present) lies with SPUI.

 Request for deletion reconsideration 

I would like to ask to have the deletion of the page ANA SANTIAGO be reconsidered on the following grounds:

A. This person has founded and heads the only Impact Evaluation Network in Latin America and the Caribbean. This network is part of LACEA (http://www.lacea.org/portal/index.php), the most important international association of economists interested in doing research in the region. She is a permanent Honorary Member of LACEA, award given by her contribution to impact evlauation reserach and policy relevance for the region ( http://www.lacea.org/portal/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=24&phpMyAdmin;=b883a10db6c19d415348047740f5c4b0&phpMyAdmin;=f18f79e76e8f09c4b5c658d1db20ad3f).The contribution of founding the network is is widely referred to and attended by policymakers, governments, NGOs, and academics in the field. This contribution falls into the category """"creative professionals"""" of the notability criteria, mostly 2 and 3 with c) of number 4:

""""Creative professionals
Scientists, academics, economists, professors, authors, editors, journalists, filmmakers, photographers, artists, architects, engineers, and other creative professionals:
1.The person is regarded as an important figure or is widely cited by peers or successors.
2.The person is known for originating a significant new concept, theory or technique.
3. The person has created, or played a major role in co-creating, a significant or well-known work, or collective body of work, that has been the subject of an independent book or feature-length film, or of multiple independent periodical articles or reviews.
4. The person's work either (a) has become a significant monument, (b) has been a substantial part of a significant exhibition, (c) has won significant critical attention, or (d) is represented within the permanent collections of several notable galleries or museums.""""

B. Further, this person is part of the very small team of persons that have been given the mandate from the Haitian government to redesign a major reform and reconstruction of Haiti's education system following the 2010 earthquake. This has been cited in other pages such as MARCELO CABROL

""""Reconstructing Haiti's Education system after the 2010 earthquake: President Preval gave the Inter-American Development Bank, IDB the mandate to work with the Education Ministry and the National Commission preparing a major reform of the Education System in a 5 year plan.

[New Schools for Haiti (in French)] [5year plan to reconstruct] 5 year plan]]; Mr. Vallas has been working with the Bank in this effort. For more information: Education Division Chief Marcelo Cabrol""""

C. Finally, she leads the all the research and evaluation of one of the main Multilaterals (IDB) on Education topics, directly responsible for ongoing pilots and evaluations for over 200 million dollars. Part of this work has been taking the implementation and designing the impact evaluation of the Teach for America (national teaching corps) model to the region currently in place in Chile, Peru, Argentina, Brazil, and Colombia. The evaluation design improves on the US evaluations so far, fac that has been recognized and cited in the region and outside (including the US and Europe) by Wendy Kopp, founder of TFA.

Up until now, the lead for this article has read like a press release for the PIRA, which I guess is the reason that we have such vociferous objections to including a documented fact about this organsition within the lead. It is not pushing an ideology to state how many the PIRA killed and injured, it's simply presenting a major fact about this organisations achievements. The only real issue, is ensuring we have the correct verifiable figures - which is easily done for those killed, not so easily done for those injured. Numerous suggestions have been put forward with regards to re-wording the """"contentious"""" sentance, but these suggestions have been met with tantrums and abuse, so what do we do ? Until such time as those objecting to the statement can behave themselves and work towards an agreement on wording, we are stuck with what we have.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Dear Feezo,

My name is Jonathan Obar user:Jaobar, I'm a professor in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences at Michigan State University and a Teaching Fellow with the Wikimedia Foundation's Education Program. This semester I've been running a little experiment at MSU, a class where we teach students about becoming Wikipedia administrators. Not a lot is known about your community,  and our students (who are fascinated by wiki-culture by the way!) want to learn how you do what you do, and why you do it. A while back I proposed this idea (the class) to the community HERE, were it was met mainly with positive feedback. Anyhow, I'd like my students to speak with a few administrators to get a sense of admin experiences, training, motivations, likes, dislikes, etc. We were wondering if you'd be interested in speaking with one of our students.

So a few things about the interviews:
 Interviews will last between 15 and 30 minutes.
 Interviews can be conducted over skype (preferred), IRC or email. (You choose the form of communication based upon your comfort level, time, etc.)
 All interviews will be completely anonymous, meaning that you (real name and/or pseudonym) will never be identified in any of our materials, unless you give the interviewer permission to do so.
 All interviews will be completely voluntary. You are under no obligation to say yes to an interview, and can say no and stop or leave the interview at any time.
 The entire interview process is being overseen by MSU's institutional review board (ethics review). This means that all questions have been approved by the university and all students have been trained how to conduct interviews ethically and properly.

Bottom line is that we really need your help, and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak with you. If interested, please send me an email at obar@msu.edu (to maintain anonymity) and I will add your name to my offline contact list. If you feel comfortable doing so, you can post your name  instead.

If you have questions or concerns at any time, feel free to email me at obar@msu.edu. I will be more than happy to speak with you.

Thanks in advance for your help. We have a lot to learn from you.

Sincerely,

Jonathan Obar",0,0,0,0,0,0

 RE: Alive (Jessie J album) 

The notability criteria for albums is WP:NALBUMS. Actually the track listing confirmed by Digital Spy and Idolator is taken from a version of the album on Amazon France which has been removed from sale. Jessie even confirms herself here that the track listing is fake. Thus when you remove that from the album, all of the background section is unsourced.

 links 

Dharmabum420 and others seem to enjoy removing links from the article. I am not a webmaster or even know one. I found the site outside the wall on my space, and since then have found it to be quicker on posting news and tour info then any of the other sites. I think it deserves a link here with the others. I must admit, I messed up the link by missing a few rules to begin, but since then have fixed that. Dharmabum420 said it seemed self promotion, well I simply just copied the title of the page, it is not self promotion. Since then I have written what features the site holds, but it continues to be removed. Google stats do not legitimate how good a site is for info, and this is NOT a rule by Wikipedia, so stop treating it as one. Thank you, please keep the link 
I would suggest the link be removed until a consensus can be reached here.
I'll assume that it's not self-promotion despite the earlier """"greatest site ever!"""" type description, but regardless, I would personally argue against the inclusion of the site, for a variety of reasons:
Wikipedia is not a link repository, and guidlines suggest only one fan site for such an article, and we already have far more than that.
No Google hit within the first 100 links in a """"pink floyd"""" search and no Alexa rating; while not a set policy on Wikipedia, such rankings are often used to determine a site's notability when trying to decide whether to include the site in an article already well-stocked with other, high-rated sites.
The only content on the site that is not easily available on far more popular sites is a selection of photos of people's tattoos. While mildly interesting, it's hard to argue that it increases the value of the Pink Floyd article itself, as few people who read the article will be searching it out for information on Pink Floyd tattoos.
Much content on the site is commerical, marketing T-shirts and the like. This is clear in the discography, which holds no information other than a simple list of the albums (available on Wikipedia itself anyway) with links to purchase them to an Amazon seller account.
The site in question is very low-quality compared to the rest of the resource links; confusing, messy and difficult to navigate, intrusive music with no way of turning it off, and it has major compatibility problems with Firefox 1.5 and Safari (perhaps others, that's what I've got to try).
That's my 2¢ on this particular site. - a 

I'll double 's 2¢ and even add in another penny to make it an even nickel. It's a very sub-par site and doesn't contribute anything to this article.  

I will disagree with both of you. while you claim only one fan site is appropriate, it clearly states """"Note: fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included.)"""" this fansite is very imformative and has more details on wanted details. For example, this site has details about a On an island live dvd with a direct link to saying David will record the rah shows for a dvd. Visit the other sites, none of them have this info and this is just one instance. You are wrong about it being the normal material. Also after paying attention to this site for sometime, it has continued to be the first in announcing tour dates for Rogers tour, and apparently has already secured a interview with one of Rogers bandmates. While you may think that the videos on the site are annoying, many fans love this. I am one of them, I cant think of another site where I can view much of the videos on this site. You say its difficult to navigate and I laugh at that, there is a simple naviagtion bar at the left hand side of each page, just like fleeting glimpses bar. Also every site has a discography, but very few have a videography, this alon makes this site better then most. So it has some comercial availability...so what? It still is a great source of info. Your google pink floyd rankings are a joke. 80 out of the first 100 are not updated and far subpar then this site. I wonder how many people search for pink floyd tattos, probably far more then you think, because I for one know of no other site that has this, and I have picked a tat from the site to get myself. This site deserves a link and I disagree with both of you

 Also now that I think about it, show me another site that streams Davids mermaid gig, or has each of his promo videos for tracks of the new album? Not even DG.com has those avaialable anymore. Also how about the interview on the Roger waters tour page? Link the other fansite that has this. None do. This site was also the first that had Rogers complete touring band lineu",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Edit summary 

When editing an article on Wikipedia there is a small field labelled """"Edit summary"""" under the main edit-box. It looks like this:

The text written here will appear on the Recent changes page, in the page revision history, on the diff page, and in the watchlists of users who are watching that article. See m:Help:Edit summary for full information on this feature.

When you leave the edit summary blank, some of your edits could be mistaken for vandalism and may be reverted, so please always briefly summarize your edits, especially when you are making subtle but important changes, like changing dates or numbers. Thank you.  

I do, when I'm doing anything more than grammar. The only exception to this would be on Clan Fraser of Lovat, of which I'm the only editor at present, and I didn't think to add edit summaries. Otherwise, I believe that I have done so. If you have any particular situations in which I have failed to do so, I'd be happy to explain myself; I'd much appreciate it.  
See it for yourself: Green bars are for edit summaries, red bars are for edits with no summaries.  
That's quite a nifty tool there. I'm fully aware of edit summaries. I don't provide edit summaries on my own talk page, or my User Page. I also don't usually provide them on other users' talk pages. In earlier editing, I didn't take the summary seriously; if you're referring to anything from several months ago or more, I do apologize. Like I said: if you have any particular situations where you believe I missed one, please bring them up to me. I would sincerely like to know. Otherwise, I don't see what you're trying to accomplish here.  
I think the link speaks for itself.  As for what I'm trying to accomplish, I think my original comment explained just that.  
If you were trying to just helpfully remind me, I thank you, though I don't think it was needed. I saw the page; it didn't say anything to me, except that I finally know my edit count. If you really want to get a point across to me, I suggest you do so blatantly. If your original comment explained your motives, then we are done here.  

 Your """"nonsense"""" page 

If you are interested in archiving your old talk, you may want to review Wikipedia:How to archive a talk page.  Accusing other editors of """"defacing"""" your talk page for politely reminding you of Wikipedia policies against personal attacks does not demonstrate good faith on your part, and will only make you look bad.  I suggest you move the archive to a more appropriate name like User talk:Canaen/archive1.  Furthermore, making negative comments about discussion by other editors, and claiming that their edits """"are not worth reading"""" shows that you aren't interested in abiding by  WP:NPA, WP:CIV, nor WP:EQ.  If you want to improve your working relationship with other editors, it might help to avoid incivility.  
I'm not interested in archiving my old talk as of yet, but thank you for the suggestion. I use """"nonsense"""" in a lot of ways other people do not, because I find a lot of other words to be boring at present. Likewise,  instead of """"cool,"""" or """"awesome,"""" or """"that's interesting,"""" I'm currently in the habit of referring to things as """"nifty."""" It's something I do. I know how to archive a talk page, I've done it before. I still do not consider suggesting ignorance to be a personal attack, because I've grown up in a rather intellectual atmosphere. I'm not going to change just because a few people are offended at my words. I thought that this was resolved by now. I have quite decent relationships with other working editors; it seems that a particular user and myself simply do not get along. It is regretful, but something which seems to be.

Ralf Reski may meet the criteria, but if he does, there is no evidence of that in the article. If he indeed does meet the criteria, please add the evidence for this to the article. While it is true that these are just guidelines, and that exceptions may exist where the person is notable in spite of not meeting any criterion, the case for notability nevertheless needs to be made. I’m not trying to prove that he isn’t notable, I’m trying to determine if he is.
As far as I can see, the criteria are not met:
1. The person's research has made significant impact in their scholarly discipline, broadly construed, as demonstrated by independent reliable sources.
I’m not a fan of citation metrics, and they’re not the final word, but the h-index is 30, which is pretty average. The most cited paper does have over 300 citations, but that’s the moss genome sequence, where he’s one of many authors. Genome sequences always get lots of citations.
2. The person has received a highly prestigious academic award or honor at a national or international level.
This may be true, but the article does not mention it. I don’t think a Heisenberg fellowship counts as ‘highly prestigious.
3. The person is or has been an elected member of a highly selective and prestigious scholarly society or association (e.g. a National Academy of Sciences or the Royal Society) or a Fellow of a major scholarly society for which that is a highly selective honor (e.g. the IEEE).
Again this may be true, but isn’t mentioned in the article.
4. The person's academic work has made a significant impact in the area of higher education, affecting a substantial number of academic institutions.
No major textbooks or other examples of this are given in the article.
5. The person holds or has held a named chair appointment or """"Distinguished Professor"""" appointment at a major institution of higher education and research.
No evidence for this is given in the article.
6. The person has held a major highest-level elected or appointed academic post at a major academic institution or major academic society.
From what I can see in the article, the highest position he has held was dean of the Faculty of Biology.
7 The person has made substantial impact outside academia in their academic capacity.
No evidence for this given in the article.
8. The person is or has been the head or chief editor of a major well-established academic journal in their subject area.
Only normal editorial board memberships given in the article.
9. The person is in a field of literature (e.g writer or poet) or the fine arts (e.g. musician, composer, artist), and meets the standards for notability in that art, such as WP:CREATIVE or WP:MUSIC.
Does not apply.
If you can show that the criteria are met after all, I’m happy to go along with it, but just being a professor does not satisfy WP:PROF. Cheers!   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

8306db99315a531a,"Separation of personal life from main 'eras' section 
The separation of Michael's personal life info from the main 'eras' section is going too far with this categorization thing which seems to have swept up the article recently. Introducing an 'influence' section was alright, as that didn't take from the main body, the chronological section, of the article. But taking out things deemed 'personal' and plonking them neatly under four different areas just doesn't flow well. It junts the reader in and out of various years, and just doesn't work. Before, the article was chronological, and a certain degree of chronology is good in a biographical article. Let me clear up one thing: the eras don't just mean what was related to the ALBUM of the era. The eras are simply a convenient way of splitting up Michael's life into nice sections. We don't need to FURTHER split the article up. I think that we should put personal stuff back into the main chronological bit, as people seem to have misinterpreted what the 'eras' are meant to be. His career and his personal life should go together. For example, the Oprah Interview, once aired, significantly increased sales of Dangerous. That link cannot be neatly established if the two 'bits' (for lack of a better word) are separated. I am trying to reach a new consensus to have the personal stuff put back into the main body, as right not the article seems to be a skeleton of subheadings. The eras are tiny, and any reader will be confused by the layout, which isn't chronological.

 Pashtuns 
According to scholars, Pashtun people are of unknown origin.

 Some comments 

Cant help myself ;-) 
You may want to look into adding about the Poestenkill Gorge (where the High Falls are) and the legend of the Native American who """"kidnapped"""" a white girl and """"married"""" her and hid out in a cave there along with some history of the various mills. You may want to talk about the gorge in the geography section. There are so many beautiful dams that today create lakes and waterfalls of their own you may want pictures of them too, Lake Ida behind the Stewarts at 2 and 66, with several very old dams along the Poesten kill within walking distance of there.
It would be tresspassing technically but there's a great waterfall on par with the ones you have pictures of (I think its called Fred's Hole or something like that?) out past Tamarac schools on Route 2, driving east there's an old abandoned bridge on the left past where the falls are, if you park there and walk over the bridge and follow the paths back the way you came you'll reach after about a 2 or 3 minute walk the top of the falls. I dont know if kids still go there and jump off the waterfall, but I went there once when I was 17 (all for a girl of course). If you cant get there that way there should be an official looking town-owned building before you get to the bridge, it sits (I believe) roughly right before where the falls and there should be a path from it to the bottom of the falls.

 Ka Sesotho 

Kgotso, ntate McDonald.

Thanks for your input at the Sesotho talk page. I guess it really does depend on one's experiences but I do believe that there are numerous rational justifications to use the names """"Sesotho"""" and """"Basotho"""" (eg. ambiguity of """"Sotho"""" which could refer to half a dozen different things) but I feel that the most important reason is that one should use the original form of the native name instead of arbitrarily modifying it (especially for a name which is not commonly used by average English speakers).

I am rather intrigued by how you peace corps guys manage to learn these languages so quickly and be able to use them in the countries.

What exactly do the peace corps do, exactly? Judging from the film """"eLollipop"""" it appears that it's mainly an international volunteer organisation that goes to poor countries to attempt to uplift the people at grassroots level  which sounds like a lot of fun (yes, I probably SHOULD take a look at the Wikipedia article and stop asking you this stuff).

""""That HUAC went after Communists (and little after those other groups) might have something to do with the fact that the Cold War involved a Communist empire, not a Nazi one.""""

The Cold War also involved brutal lynchings, Jim Crow, intimidation of blacks and union members of all races, civil liberties violations and segregationist leadership and members of congress, not to mention world wide human rights abuses, rape of resources, thefts, colonialist thievery, ethnic calseasing of people of color on four continents!

Some called for the leaders of the Ku Klux Klan to be interrogated by the HUAC. Martin Dies however was a supporter of the Klan and had spoken at several of its rallies. Other members of the HUAC such as John Rankin and John S. Wood were also Klan sympathizers. Wood defended the Klan by arguing that: """"The threats and intimidations of the Klan are an old American custom, like illegal whiskey-making.""""
Eventually Ernest Adamson, the HUAC's chief counsel, announced that: """"The committee has decided that it lacks sufficient data on which to base a probe."""" John Rankin added: After all, the KKK is an old American institution."""" Instead, the HUAC concentrated on investigating the possibility that the American Communist Party had infiltrated the Federal Writers Project and other New Deal projects.""""

I mean come on! If you truly believe that """"HUAC went after Communists (and little after those other groups) beacuse it might have something to do with the fact that the Cold War involved a Communist empire, not a Nazi one"""" you have not read ANY cold war civil rights history. They nver went after them WHEN we were at war. The US has NEVER gone after neo nazis/KKK/hate groups in even a remotely close fashion/dedication as they have to Leftits. Non-government groups and people have done the leg work for them.

I thank that's generalising too much. It wasn't just the right that isolated Robeson in the 1950s but a broad political spectrum.
WHITEWASH. Who and what was this broad spectrum?  Please? Isolated FROM is not the factor while ISOLATED BY IS! Apart from liberals who were scared away eventually who else was it then? And who instigated his blacklisting and persecution? the daily harassment and surveillances that were ceaseless, that led TO the isolation itself? You are reverting history no just this article.

I just don't want to have the basic fact that he supported (whatever the details) that political system to be swept under the carpet under romantic notions of """"socialist experiment"""".

IT IS NOT SWEPT UNDER. The USSR is in there it is just not the whole article and it '''was an experiment''' when he arrived in 1934, less than two DECADES after the revolution. People can make up their own minds

Ancestry and racial origin are interchangeable and means the same thing. There is no need to play on words, but thank you for the feedback Rossrs, I appreciate yours. As for Mr.Wild, Well wildie she is not 1/4 this or 1/4 that, since when was this theory? Talk about sticking to the topic, You can look at the woman and see she is black! Her father is black! Her mother is part black! . Where is the complexity?? You want to get nitty gritty she mentions black 3 times and Puerto Rican once. That would make her 1/8th Puerto Rican if you want to go so far and that has nothing to do if it's black Puerto Rican lineage or otherwise.There's nothing complicated the only complication are you(zealot editors), who choose to use give blind allegiance to your clan members opinions  other than what is truth then turn around and hide under """"POV-pushing and much to-do over nothing."""" To get off topic a bit, Barack obama was a nigger, NOT nigga, but a Nigger up till Nov 4th or when it became apparent he was to become POTUS no.44. After that he then became mixed, then bi-racial then finally half white ,not half black mind you, but half white. Some person or persons feel very proud that this young lady has a trace of Puerto Rican lineage in her family tree and I have absolutely no objection with that naturally. But its just that,a trace, there is no need for a Puerto rican ascendancy with a link of Puerto Rican actresses and definitely no need to be stating Puerto Rican as a defining characteristic of her. It's trivial for she is far from being Puerto Rican both culturally and genetically. If anything there should be a native Amerindian link. Put the shoe on the other foot and this young lady was four shades lighter and possessed 1/8th African heritage and 'looked' Nordic. Would a link for African American actresses be up there? Would Black be mention first even if she had said it first??? You can bet your ass not! And you know it! I doubt it would even be mentioned. Matter of fact when I'm done here I'm heading over to the John Mccain page to kick up some dusk   for inclusion of his black ancestry, yes sir. And guess what else Mr.wild?

Hey, how's it goin' Ginkgo100? I had a couple ideas I wanted to bounce off another editor to see what they thought: you’re the editor. Here's what’s going on in my head:

First; I was looking at the Bill Ritter (politician) article a little while ago and thinking it was a little dull. You scored that good shot of Ritter at the CDC, and that's about all the color we've got. So, I stopped by Ritter's campaign site (http://www.ritterforgovernor.com) and found a great screenshot off KUSA of the latest poll numbers (drop by and take a look if you can). I thought maybe this might be worth uploading (if applicable; didn't check yet) and using in the Ritter article and Colorado gubernatorial election, 2006. What do you think?

In a related thought, I stumbled upon the video of the Ritter/Beauprez debates from Aug. 11 (Here's a link ). Other articles I've read have contained video, but this one might be a little to long (any thoughts?) and may not be material appropriate or applicable to upload onto Wikipedia.

Second, I'm going to plunge into a clean-up effort that looks a little challenging over at National Western Stock Show (take a look and you'll see what I mean). If you can, and you like what's one of my favorite events in Denver, drop by the article and help me out a little.

As my response there indicates I don't share your opinion, but I understand where you're coming from. In that comment you also said """"I'd really like to avoid protecting them for the duration if that can be avoided, but if you keep bringing issues to my attention, I'll do my utmost to make your life easier"""". So this is the """"bring the issues to your attention"""" on my part. See this 3RR request  filed by User:Kudzu1.

So. How can my life be made easier? SPI? I already filed one, on one sock master  (though that's probably a different person) and some other users have filed others (for example ). The problem is - and notice that a CU has not even gotten around to the SPI I filed - that by the time the CUs get around to considering these cases, the person(s) behind these accounts have already thrown them away and moved onto new SPAs which keep doing the same thing.

There is no """"magic"""" or """"grace"""" or """"opening the third eye"""" involved. For the last 8 years the Knowledge has been imparted via a video presentation in which people come and watch an explanation of the techniques presented by the teacher Maharaji.
Four promise are asked before the video presentation is shown (these are made verbally and no legal document signed, students are trusted implicitly.) Give a fair chance to Knowledge, don't reveal the techniques to others and keep in touch with the teachings. 
The whole presentation last 2 1/2 hours.
As there is no group activities ot colective payer sessions or any other type of liturgy, students are free to use these techniques (one hour per day is recommended). There is no cohersion to do anything, beyond the very mild promise """"give a fair chance to the practice.""""

Wikipedia's founder, Jimmy Wales, has admitted that the much loved """"free encyclopedia"""" has at least some quality problems. To some of us, this is nothing new. I've had more than one student rely on Wikipedia for accurate information for a paper, and it always ends up the same way: """"well, I got it off of Wikipedia, thinking it was good..."""".

And therein lies the problem. If you keep in mind that anyone, and I mean anyone, can edit a Wikipedia entry, then you are treading on dangerous ground if you're going to cite it as a source of fact. While it's true that errors often get corrected, they don't always, and what happens in the meantime is that bad info sits there, misinforming people. Of course, this isn't true just in the case of Wikipedia. It's a problem online, in general. I recently was party to an argument over the historicity of Jesus, and one person used a source that claimed that Philo of Alexandria lived in Jerusalem. He's called Philo of Alexandria for a reason, you know.[] 

I used to be such an unadulterated fan of Wikipedia you know. The idea of an open source online reference that grew on a daily basis was quite an attractive one back in the day. But in recent times I've become wary of the encyclopaedia anyone can edit, and not simply because of a few high profile choice edits.

Whatever about libel and congressional cherry picking amidst the many articles of this once noble enterprise, what really gets me about Wikipedia is that I can't trust it on most issues. There are so many agendas, axes to grind and purely mischievous vandals that 90% of what I would be interested in reading about - history, politics and so on - is tripe. To read an article on a contentious subject one can pick out bias, attempted compromise and ultimate failure almost immediately. Wade into the """"Talk"""" page, where these edits are discussed, and you are confronted with chaos. There are too many vested interests at stake, and from the War on Terror to the Welfare State one will find an army of people taking one view or another entering into what are known as """"Revert Wars"""", where they revert any edits back to the version which suits them.

From self-interest to political interest one can find """"POV"""" (Point of View) shading almost every major article that touches on the live wires of our society. Thus I wouldn't trust anything that's even half-way current or ongoing on Wikipedia.

For one, the facts can be skewed. Secondly, the article can change overnight depending on how organised a campaign is launched against an article (and they do happen.)

e130ab0ed26b5a34,"History > Recent Years > CWCC Paragraph 

This whole paragraph should be removed or at the very least reworked (and probably moved to Tourism) for several reasons:
 * The paragraph is proportionally way too long; this article is on Cambodia, not on an alleged scandal  of a local NGO
 * It only offers one side of the story
 * It uses few valid references (most of them being articles from the same source: stuff.co.nz)
 * Right now, it sounds like a friend of the NZ guy in this particular conflict between an alleged perpetrator and CWCC is taking a stand using Wikipedia, which would totally inappropriate

What, IMO, needs to be done to make it acceptable into this article:
 * Describe the other side of the story too: most of the time, sex offender will pay the girls family to push them to change their version of the story, sometimes accusing NGOs of forcing them into accusing the perpetrator.
 * Reduce the paragraph length, defocus on one incident and make it more general (if you can't, then that's a good hint this should never have been included) and move it to tourism section. Do not pollute the rest of the article
 * Include more reliable & diversified references (again if you can't, then that's another good hint of the inappropriateness of this paragraph)

I will remove the paragraph, and also other insertion in the article which I would rather label 'pollution'. Further discussion can take place here",0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm guess you're monitoring Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Actors and Filmmakers, where an interesting proposal has been made on the colors of the Actor infobox. I'm leaning towards gold, but am like you - I'd like to see one default color.

Thai film list
Over at the , I ran into a problem with the box being too long and it was running into the year heading for the 1920s films. So I changed the map image to one that was horizontal. I think the svg locator-map renderings are more appropriate. They have been made for every country, are a standard size and easier to discern than the satellite images. It's something to consider  not that I'm trying to add to your workload. I was just having a problem with the Thai film list, and that's the solution I came up with. I hope you understand. However, these locator maps might also prove to be workable for the regional cinema templates that contain the soon-to-be-deleted film reel image, if only just temporarily until a more """"filmy"""" image is located.

Oh, thanks for adding the Tony Jaa photo to Cinema of Thailand. It was one I took a couple of years ago, and is out of focus. I've never liked it that much, but uploaded it out of desperation when I had nothing else. I moved it  lower on the page and added a caption. My favorite photo so far is the one of the Siam Theater marquee when it was playing The Tin Mine, and the marquee was Thai characters. That, to me, is the cinema of Thailand, literally. I try to take my camera to press preview events when I get the chance. The free-use photos have so much more flexibility than the gol-durned fair-use images, which are becoming increasingly problematic and restrictive. I fear that in the near future, most, if not all, fair-use images will be banned from English Wikipedia.

Under Genetic explanations, WRN has written this - 

To support these claims, they often cite several lines of evidence that they interpret as support for a partly genetic cause of group differences in IQ:   1. Black–White–East Asian differences in IQ, reaction time, and brain size are observed worldwide in a range of cultures and environments. In the United States, significant Black-White IQ differences are observable at every age above 3 years, within every occupation or socioeconomic level tested, in every region of the country, and at every time since the invention of ability tests.[106]   2. Jensen and other have argued that the magnitude of race differences on different IQ subtests correlate with the extent to which those subtests measures g,[107] which also correlates with measures of the subtests heritability.[108] From these and other findings, they argue that race differences have a partly biological basis.[109]   3. The rising heritability of IQ with age (within all races; studies have found on average in the developed world heritability starts at 20% in infants, rises to 40% in middle childhood, and peaks at 80% in adulthood); and studies showing the virtual disappearance (~0.0) by adulthood of shared environmental effects on IQ (for example, family income, education, and home environment), with adopted siblings partaking in the studies no more similar in IQ than with strangers[110] From these studies, they argue that most suggested environmental explanations for IQ difference between groups do not have a strong enough effect on IQ to fully account for group differences.
4. Studies of US comparisons of both parents to children and siblings to each other finding regression to differing means for different races (85 for Blacks and 100 for Whites) across the entire range of IQs,[111] despite the fact that siblings are matched for shared environment and genetic heritage, with regression unaffected by family socioeconomic status and generation examined[112]

This seems to be excessive detail.  WRN has essentially recreated Rushton/Jensen arguments, and placed citations in his citation.  This essentially allows WRN to write an entire section, as if it were incontrovertible based on various references, without any possible response.  The NPOV fact that should be reported is that Rushton and Jensen make some assertions, not that they make some assertions, and here is the factual evidence they use to back it up.  If anything, every one of their """"lines of evidence"""" should be attributed directly to Rushton and Jensen, as much of that same evidence may be interpreted as undermining the """"genetic hypothesis"""", depending on the viewer.  It seems very weaselly, in any case. 

Can we agree these four points should be removed from the article?  Comments?

If you go through the above incidents you will come to know they are many times worse than the highest number of suicide attacks which were targeted against innocent civilians by the LTTE.

I couldn’t understand what is the importance of that banning in 20 countries when hardly most of the countries civilians had not been killed by the LTTE attacks and the LTTE's activities are expanded into those countries only to the extent of fund raising from the expatriate Tamils.

He was the political adviser not the adviser to LTTE leader to carry out suicide attacks or to scheme military activities.

Composing the LTTE leader's annual speech or representing LTTE doesn’t qualify him for the """"Terrorist Tag"""" at all.

Why the talks failed every time was mainly the hardliners in the South and not by any of the Tamil groups or LTTE.

It is so stupid expecting he definitely knows all the crimes being carried out by the LTTE when he was utilised by the LTTE only at theoretical level and for negotiations.

I don’t know why that particular wikipedian feels sorry for him. For what?

 """"The term """"Arabic numerals"""" is actually a misnomer""""
 This smacks of political revisionism of the worst kind; what is known in English as the Arabic Numerals are the Arabic Western Numerals, not even the Arabic Eastern Numerals. Yes, they are derived from ancient Indian numerals but nonetheless they are the Arabic Numerals. Look here, the norm is that when people in English say Arabic Numerals they are referring to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, those are the Arabic (Western) Numerals, they are not referring to १, २, ३, ४, ५, ६, ७, ८, ९, and other varities of Indian numerals, modern or ancient. They are known in English as the Arabic Numerals, that's a fact, I will not accept a revisionist statement that counters a fact so early on in the text the article, the article must start with the factual. I'll accept it under a revisionism section much later on, but it must be balanced there with opinions counter to it (counter to the counterfactual). 

 """"... what are known in English as """"Arabic numerals"""" were neither invented nor widely used by the Arabs."""", """"In the Arab World—until modern times—the Arabic numeral system was used only by mathematicians. Muslim scientists used the Babylonian numeral system, and merchants used a numeral system similar to the Greek numeral system and the Hebrew numeral system. Therefore, it was not until Fibonacci that the Arabic numeral system was used by a large population.""""
 What reliable sources do you have that they were not widely used by the Arabs? Why don't you cite reliable sources? Here's evidence that they were  The numerals though were already in wide use throughout the Arab empire, as Avicenna who was born in 980 tells in his autobiography that he learnt them, as a child, from a humble vegetable seller. He also tells that when his father, in Bukhara, was visited by scholars from Egypt in 997, including Abu Abdullah al-Natili, they taught him more about them. J J O'Connor and E F Robertson point out: He also tells of being taught Indian calculation and algebra by a seller of vegetables. All this shows that by the beginning of the eleventh century calculation with the Indian symbols was fairly widespread and, quite significantly, was known to a vegetable trader.

 """"The first inscriptions using 0 in India have been traced to approximately 200 CE.""""
 Why don't you cite reliable sources?! Here, I'll cite some: According to Professor EF Robertson and DR JJ O'Connor, """"The first record of the Indian use of zero which is dated and agreed by all to be genuine was written in 876"""" on the Gwalior tablet stone. This is also verified by Professor Lam Lay Yong, an an Effective Member of the International Academy of the History of Science """"the earliest appearance in India of a symbol for zero in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system is found in an inscription at Gwalior which is dated 870 AD"""". According to Menninger (p. 400): """"This long journey begins with the Indian inscription which contains the earliest true zero known thus far (Fig. 226). This famous text, inscribed on the wall of a small temple in the vicinity of Gvalior (near Lashkar in Central India) first gives the date 933 (A.D. 870 in our reckoning) in words and in Brahmi numerals. Then it goes on to list four gifts to a temple, including a tract of land """"270 royal hastas long and 187 wide, for a flower-garden."""" Here, in the number 270 the zero first appears as a small circle (fourth line in the Figure); in the twentieth line of the inscription it appears once more in the expression """"50 wreaths of flowers"""" which the gardeners promise to give in perpetuity to honor the divinity."""" The Encyclopaedia Britannica says, """"Hindu literature gives evidence that the zero may have been known before the birth of Christ, but no inscription has been found with such a symbol before the 9th century."""" I'll accept mention prior to the Gwalior tablet, in fact, the article needs it and I'm planning on doing it once I'm no longer distracted by your nonsense, but such mention must be well-phrased so as not to mislead and contradict scientific consensus, and the phrasing must be limited to the exact intent of verifiable and reliable sources.

Here is the explanation of the legal side of Capital Maintenance as quoted directly from

""""The Capital Maintenance Concept and Share Repurchases in South African Law - By F.H.I Cassim and Rehana Cassim

The Capital maintenance concept 
 
The South African Companies Act 61 of 1973 adopts a strange and a curios ambivalence towards the nineteenth-century common law concept of the maintenance of the share capital of a company. In some respects, the Companies Act still clings to this archaic and outdated concept, while in other respects, it boldly sweeps away the concept and replaces it with the more modern twins tests of “liquidity” and “solvency” as a form of creditor protection.

According to the capital maintenance concept, the issued share capital of a company is seen as a guarantee fund or a permanent fund intended for the payment of the claims of the creditors of a company, with the result that the issued share capital of a company may not be reduced, nor may it be returned to shareholders except where the Companies Act or the common law authorizes it. Thus, Lord Halsbury, L.C., in The Ooregum Gold Mining Company of India Ltd v Roper,[1] declared that “[t]he capital is fixed and certain, and every creditor of the company is entitled to look to that capital as his security”. This was echoed some eight decades later in Cohen NO v Segal,[2] where the court, in prohibiting the payment of a dividend out of share capital, proclaimed that
 
“[w]hatever has been paid by a member cannot be returned to him and no part of the corpus of the company can be returned to a member so as to take away from the fund to which the creditors have a right to look as that out of which they are to be paid. The capital may be spent or lost in carrying on the business of the company, but it cannot be reduced except in the manner and with the safeguards provided by the statute.”
 
In accordance with this concept, ss.81 and 82 of the Companies Act prohibit a company from issuing its shares at a discount unless certain stringent precautions have been complied with. Section 79 prohibits a company from paying interest on shares out of share capital unless this is authorised by the articles of association of the company or by a special resolution, the interest paid is restricted to a maximum of six per cent per annum, and the approval of the Minister of Industries, Commerce and Tourism has been obtained.

These statutory provisions find their roots in the capital maintenance concept, but it no longer makes any sense to preserve them in their present form, because instead of complying with the burdensome requirements of s.79, a company may now simply make a “payment” including dividend payments in terms of s.90 (as amended in 1999), whether out of capital or profits, to its shareholders provided that this is authorised by its articles of association and that it satisfies the tests of “liquidity” and “solvency” (as explained below). A company may, if it so desires, prohibit in its articles of association such “payments”. Section 90 abandons the common law concept of capital maintenance and together with it the fundamental common law principle that dividends may only be paid out of distributable profits. Unlike English law, ss.83 and 84 which regulated reductions of share capital have been repealed by s.8 of the Companies Amendment Act 37 of 1999, with the result that there is no longer any statutory procedure for the reduction of a company’s share capital, expect in accordance with s90 of the Companies Act. Perhaps this conflict in the underlying philosophy and policy of the South African Companies Act is a direct result of the patchwork and piecemeal reform that has taken place in South African corporate law during the 30-year existence of the Companies Act of 1973. By way of contrast, ss.135-141 of the UK Companies Act 1985 have preserved the statutory procedures and regulations relating to reductions of share capital.
 
Share repurchases 

Another vital aspect of the reform of the capital maintenance concept is the right conferred by s.85 of the Companies Act (as amended by s.9 of the Companies Amendment Act 37 of 1999) to enable companies to purchase their own shares. Until 1999, South African corporate law was one of the few remaining common law jurisdictions which continued to pr",0,0,0,0,0,0

==WARNING: MEMBER THE WIKIPEDIAN GREEK NATIONALISTIC JUNTA. By User:Balkan ==
There’s a well collaborated (London based) group of GREEK Wikipedia sysops/users that  has been spotted to  work systematically in full daily basis propagandazing ultra natioanalistic Greek POV, and distorting related articles. They intervene in any Balkan history and politics related  article, pushing Greek POV, launch edit wars,  and repeated reverts of  vandalized by them versions, permanent deletions, block users, merges and redirects to deletetion of undesired new articles. Their main target is to distort all articles lelated to  ISLAM, TURKEY, REBUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, BULGARIA, ALBANIA (CHAMERIA), THEIR MINORITIES IN GREECE AND THEIR HISTORY. They attack  every article criticizing Greece transforming it  to Greekish propaganda POV. They became maniacs in optimizing dark side of Greek history.They communicate each other by secret e-mails avoiding messages through their talk pages to avoid publicity. This group acting in a systematic way to revert articles, when one of member makes the limit of 3 reverts, one another continues with 4th revert to avoid punishment for violating 3rv rule.

Furthermore they are suspected agents of Greek National Intelligence Service (E.Y.Π. Κυπατζήδες) and  believers of ultra nationalistic organizations of Greek “national interests”, as L.A.O.S. and Chrissi Avgi. They are also multiple sockpuppets and impersonators of their group members. They are all schizophrenics web vandals unacceptible to wikipedian community. Balkan history has labelled such people as GREKOMANS, a form of mental malignacy cited in Larousse dictionaries. Their illusion is MEGALI IDEA of Greek nationalism-expandism.They have been allied with Armenian, Serbian and Cypriot extremists of similar interest. THEY HAVE CONSTITUTED A WIKIPEDIAN GUNG, A GREEK PRAPAGANDA LOBBY, A GREEK EPSILON TEAM. All member of group are very radical nationalists. They work continously in three shifts over day and night.
To verify chek their  contributions, talk page, edits, deletions, blocks, directs, protected pages and act  properly. Wikipedia isn’t the right place to propagandize for “God’s elit nations” as Greece.

Any reason why? As we dont want vandalism on the Main Page so that is why it's protected. Theres not much to change anyway since its split into articles in a different area.  ۝۝۝҈ ►talk► 

And the fact that it is automatically updated per transcluded pages and variables ({{Wikipedia:Featured Article/{{CURRENTMONTHNAME}} {{CURRENTDAY}}, {{CURRENTYEAR}}).  ~trip 

Shh! It's obviously a vandal trying to learn how to vandalise the Main Page. Feed them disinformation!  

The page is cascadingly (if that's even a word) protected, so if he or she is a vandal, there is no way that he or she could vandalize pages transcluded onto the main page.  ~trip

Then, you get a big red button that says """"Are you sure you want to edit the Main Page?"""". If you click it, you can edit it (but only you, because it reads the user's IP address). Once you make the edit, it takes effect (but it isn't recorded in history, and can only be seen in a special log, which is only accessable using the """"super-password"""").

Don't listen to AO. The correct way to edit the main page is simple. To edit the main page you need to follow these steps:
Take off all your clothes
Get a friend, parent or whatever to take a photo of you editing wikipedia naked. This photo must be at least 1500x1000 pixels. (Editing the page Naked will extend your editing capability by 1 minutes but any other page is fine)
Upload said found to the wikimedia commons under a license of you choice
Go to the sandbox and put your photo there
Repeat the above step 12 times when the photo gets changed
Once you've done this, come back and click on view source. You will see a message on your screen for about 1 second. It will give you the name of a page you must edit. If you productively edit this page within 5 seconds you will now be able to edit the main page! If you miss either of this you will have to start all over again from step one (including a new photo)
Be aware that if at any time you vandalise wikipedia or try to pass off a photo of someone else as you, you will be banned from editing the main page for life x 100
Good luck!
 
Hmm... I know this discussion is cold, but wouldn't it be awesome if the Welcome to Wikipedia box said """"everyone can edit - even this very page!"""" or """"Click here to edit this very page?""""

Both comments above are pointless except to underline an unfamiliarity with the distinction between ancient texts and secondary scholarship. Let me illustrate by using your claim of a contradiction and restating what I said re Moses, as if it dealt with Odysseus, another fictional person.
'Odysseus is a fictional character invented by Homer and Homer's Odyssey is not a source for explaining the etymology of the name.'
No one would blink at that, except . . .
Just as 'Moses/mashah' is a kind of figura etymologica used by the writers to explain a name whose origins they did not know, so too is 'Odysseus/odussamemos'(Ὀδυσεὺς/ὀδυσσάμενος at Od.xix.406ff.).  This is very frequent in ancient literature. Just as modern scholarship doesn't accept the  Biblical etymology for Moses, so classical scholarship has generally disabused itself of the idea, stated by Autolykos, that Odysseus be named  'child of hate/woe' because his grandfather was in wrathful odds with the world.

The ancient Jewish readers of the Bible were quite aware, as we can see from Philo of Alexandria and Josephus, who both proposed an Egyptian etymology. In doing so, they dismissed the folk etymology given in the Tanakh, realizing that that the derivation from the verb 'to draw from' was an infra-Hebrew folk etymology, a kind of Figura etymologica as ancient rhetoric classified such games, that had no value. How could an Egyptian-speaking princess in 1,500 BC be sufficiently fluent in a language that was only attested in that form several hundred years alter, to give Moses a name that would make sense a millennium later?

Telephone waiting period
I've removed this citation of an example:

 For example, before privatization, a consumer or business would need to wait up to 10 years to get a local telephone line installed from the monopolistic state-run telephone company. A couple of years after privatization, the wait was reduced to just a few days.

This unsourced claim had been challenged and now someone is claiming personal experience as the """"source"""" (which would make it original research).

Semitransgenic, it seems like your stalking this page. I came back to this page which I originally wrote most of the material relating to the Mixmag article, and I edited it a few days ago, and BOOM your back deleting it. I'm going to revert it back to the original. Feel free to add sentences or add to the article, but please do not delete the prior material that I wrote, as all of it is true, and from someone who was there from the beginning of the scene. Simply referencing a statement to an article does not make the data relevant. For example, this page is on a sub-genre of House. That does not mean you can include a sentence stating: """"Oprah has a new TV network, and they played Techno in the background on one of her shows"""", and then you provided a reference from the newspaper. The fact that you provided the reference does follow the rules, but the sentence has nothing to do with the article on this page. That's why it was deleted. It could be added to a Disco music page though, or a Techno music page.

If you don't mind me asking, what year did you start collecting 'Progressive House' and what is the oldest record in your collection of it?

Regarding the Techno comments. Techno should be mentioned (as the sentence prior to it should be included), but that one sentence I deleted because it has nothing to do with Progressive. Also, Techno in general has little to do with Progressive. Progressive came from the House scene...specifically Acid House and very influenced from the Balearic sound of Ibiza. Techno was an influence but not the primary driver, and very little to do with Detroit.

Technically Progressive House was the next re-branding of House after Acid House, but I'm not going to get into this, it's too complicated.

Anarchism what does it mean for this anarchist hobbyist?

Anarchism started the First World War over the anarchist assassination of the Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.  A anarchist decided to interrupt a world power practicing imperialism and assassinated the Archduke as he drove by the anarchist in the tiny nation of Serbia.  What the anarchist did not know is that there were a multitude of secret treaties among no less that fourteen nations including attitude from the Ottoman Empire and within weeks the world was at war as Serbia was invaded.

The result of the war that started in the tiny nation of Serbia is millions of deaths, chemical warfare, proof of machine gun and artillery fire, introduction of aviation into warfare, the Russian communist revolution, and a new world order that led to World War Two, since the Germans believed it was their leaders who failed them causing them to lose the war.

World War Two led to millions of deaths and a larger battlefield across the world including China and the Pacific Ocean (Japan was part of World War One, but the results were insignificant compared to the bloody battlefields of Europe).  The results of World War Two led to nuclear weapons, a space race, spy satellites, nuclear ships, nuclear bombers, nuclear missiles, communism across the world from communist Russia, United States being called imperialist due to being a world wide undefeated military power who is unafraid to invade anyone except the nations with the largest and best militaries (Iraq had a lager but sad capability military).  World War Two also led to the Cold War, Korean War, Vietnam War, and Desert Storm One that was the result of the former allies of World War Two dividing among themselves into two parties and fighting low intensity and hot wars across the world until the year 1991 including, for many families, three or more generations of military service from the United States.

Serbia as a result of the wars across the world of the 20th century has been subjected to the Muslims, Russians, United States, Germans, and civil war within itself and still has United States intervention this 21st century.  Under President Clinton Serbia was made smaller requiring a split of Kosovo and Serbia after a long bombing campaign that exhausted the stockpile of conventional United States missiles during the 1990s.

Serbia got its anarchy and is a backwards nation that has been under subjugation and gunfire since the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand.

Once again, I disagree on all counts.

Your recent edit at Sarahs talk page 
You recently made a comment on Sarah777's talkpage which was quite strong in content. If this comment was not being addressed to Sarah, but to the IP contributor who preceeded you on the page, then it should have been made on the IP's talkpage. You should only address Sarah on Sarah's page. If, OTOH, you were addressing your remarks to sarah then you were way out of line. Either way I think you owe Sarah an apology. I also thing you should revert your edit and place it on the IPs talk page.   

It is quite obvious that i'm addressing it to the IP as Sarah never made a threat. It is hardly way out of line seeing as the IP was making what could be easily regarded as combative threat. Also its a talk page, but if you insist i shall remove the message to their talk page. An apology? I remember the last time i asked you for an apology.  (talk) 

I'm actually thinking of reverting my removal of the message as the IP's address is not static and each time they appear, their IP will be different.  (talk) 
The IPs threat is as hollow as his/her head. I wouldn't pay much attention to it.   
No need to personally attack them with the hollow comment. A threat by an Irishman (republican or loyalist) should never be taken as hollow lol.  (talk) 

I never made a threat , mabuska , so stop crying . GoodDay , my head is far from hollow, I have a static IP ,so how do I do it? please explain and personal remarks are not allowed please apologise .Back to mabuska. Never met a loyalist who is Irish , not once , did you ? """"could be easily regarded as combative threat."""" If I did make a threat you would have no problems reading it , even as like myself english is not your first tongue . Now there are going to be some issues over how I do bussiness on here , I understand that , and I DO NOT apologise for them .Now any questions? This is going to be fun .  — Preceding unsigned comment added by 109.78.243.56   

If you want to be a disruptive, arguementative, combative editor, go ahead. Such editors usually end up being indefinately blocked. Actually the vast majority of broadband IP's are never static as far as i'm as i'm aware, so unless you create an actual account to edit with, you will end up with a different IP every different day or week you appear unless it cycles back to one you've already used.

Anyways who said i was a loyalist? Never said i was and will state quite clearly for you that i am not one. If i was i'd had no shame in declaring that i am.

You show your own lack of knowledge of Irish history anyways. What was James Craig, someone you can call a loyalist, described as at his funeral? As a proud Ulsterman and Irishman. Edward Carson himself was a proud Irishman but can also be easily classified as a loyalist. They always said the Troubles was mostly due to ignorance and prejudice - especially towards history. 

If you really want to make a difference on Wikipedia and be somewhat successful at doing so the best way is to play by Wikipedias rules and not by being disruptive or coming out with childish remarks such as """"stop crying"""" or implying threats.  (talk) 

Never called you a loyalist -where did you get that from I dont makes assumptions , asked you a question , you failed to answer - the men you mention are no longer and by definition you could not meet them Ireland is a sovereign state and that was my point even the loyalist I know are not Irish citizens which is what Irish is defined as , never implied a threat stop crying lol , Wikipedia has to obey wider rules than its own , I have no lack of knowledge , how do editors get block by not going by the rules -I havent broken any nor will I , now if you dont mind I have some work to do , now apologise to me for FALSELY saying I threatened you .""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Articles for deletion/Fruit (slang) 

Copy deemed personal attack and removed from discussion page:  I believe that LtPowers was coerced into making his statement of defense. Here's how it happened: the fruity editor Benjiboi seeks to impose her queer agenda here at WP, i.e., to include anything and everything related to queerdom whether or not it's notable or sourced. Any editor who questions her edits, additions, ideas, etc., whether or not warranted, is branded a homophobe, or a homophobic vandal (whom she must """"fight""""). Instead of defending her work on the strength of its merits, apparent or lacking, she cleverly, and sometimes not subtly, transforms the issue to: """"if you're not with me, you're against me!"""" And so the focus of the discussion here shifted from whether to include her work to whether Powers is a homophobe, and how dare Powers attack sick, tired Benjiboi. And this arouses everybody's sympathies for poor, poor Benjiboi. Yeah, now it's """"I'm on a break, I'm off to rest from fighting those (omnipresent) homophobic vandals."""" What's next?  """"My white count is way off (so give me what I want)"""" or how about """"I'm throwing up my meds (so let me have my article)?"""" Oh, and how commendable that she still edits here while on break from battle  what dedication! Look, I'll say one thing for Benjiboi: she is a skillful manipulator.

Well, Alan, the article may be more about a type of smoking than a type of smoking reduction but the benefit of one-hitters to the latter issue remains important.
You have reduced the number of pictures to 3 this seems to me unbalanced in that Smoking pipe (tobacco) is allowed to run on for over 23,000 bytes (all drawn from only 3 notes, 3 references, 5 external links) with 11 pictures compared to One-hitter (smoking) with under 4000 bytes and 3 pictures.  Factbase: I should google this first, but I think I saw an article stating that only 1% of the tobacco smokers worldwide use a pipe (compared with 5% cigar and 94% cigarettes); if 1/10 as many persons used cannabis as tobacco and 10% of cannabis users used a one-hitter, on that basis alone besides there being ethnic one-hitters used for tobacco too the articles should have equal length.
I think the value of the article depends partly on some information (particularly history) which is conveniently presented in picture captions; so how about I look into using the """"gallery"""" approach which posts the pictures at the bottom of the article, smaller than the regular thumbnail kind but enlargeable.

Notability tagging
You put a Notability tag on Secretariat (book). There are two problems with your action:
 1) Secretariat is one of the most notable horses in the history of American Thoroughbred racing with a worldwide reputation, was listed by ESPN at No. 35 of the 100 greatest athletes of the 20th century, one of three non-humans on the list, and the United States Postal Service honored Secretariat with his image on a first class postage stamp with.

Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Three or four editors have censored the section in question; ten have maintained it. The three or four are very loud and aggressive, and claim to represent a consensus; that is just the  rhetorical trick known as bandwagoning (claiming that one's opinion represents the popular will, in order to con new people into adopting it, and thus bring about a self-fulfilling prophecy).

But consider this. The censors became so smug that they inspired me to do some research a day or two ago (see my earlier note for date). It took me only minutes to learn that all whites are being targeted as part of a campaign of state-sanctioned racial expropriation and genocide. And so, the significance of the attack on Gordimer actually resides within a context that is staggeringly larger and more important than I had previously known. And yet, the censors are unmoved by this news. Imagine if the races were reversed. They would be shouting from the rooftops about the attack. But they do not want anyone to know about the South African genocide. Apparently, some cases of genocide are more equal than others.

""""Editors who feel this material should be included need to respond to the various reasons offered why it is not, at this point, notable.""""

As lquilter well knows, I have responded many times. He is simply trying to rewrite history.

Now notability is the subject of some admins self created mind made policy, which they apply any where to delete put notices, reverting or do any thing which they want.

The list of creating notable blogs are really a good efforts and I request all admins let this page be on wikipedia & co-operate with this author with positive mind so the people can take good references and create knowledgeable , fair articles with the help of sources.

Her popularity is partisan-based. She's popular to conservative white Americans, but unpopular to hated among Asian-Americans (not to mention the Philippines itself). I remain unconvinced as to why you think that makes her the best person to represent Filipino-Americans.

Aside from being an oddly specific notability requirement, being on the NYT bestseller list the longest doesn't erase the fact that her work has nothing to do with Filipino-Americans. She complains about being the target of racism, but actively criticizes Asian-Americans to the point that she herself has been called racist. She is relevant in an article on conservatism perhaps. But here, her relevance is eclipsed by people who have actually been part of the Filipino (or Asian)-American identity  and have no negative or controversial reputations with regards to the subject matter.

Wikipedia has a neutral point of view, which means we strive for articles that advocate no single point of view. Sometimes this requires representing multiple points of view; presenting each point of view accurately; providing context for any given point of view, so that readers understand whose view the point represents; and presenting no one point of view as """"the truth"""" or """"the best view"""".

Happy belated: birthday, Merry Christmas, Happy New Year, and Groundhog Day.

Take a break from all the WP nannying. Hope you're doing great @ MIT.

Take another look at December 2008’s and last month’s archived portal pages and see if they work correctly on your end. Shades of Extreme Home Makeover - etc.

This may be the closest I get to re-mastering old films, like they now have to do for Blu-Ray. Feels like it, fun but tedious.

Some of these archived portal pages I've trundled through going back to Jan of '08 (so far) succumb to table-formatting bugs (on my platform [Tiger/Safari (+FF3)]). So I kludged the position of the calendars. But these two months work fine. No clue as to why they break. Is there a documented bug? This seems to be some kind of CSS error.

The Portal:Current events/How to archive the portal page must not be visited very often of late, so I'm attempting to make its link more prominent by adding a comment above the """"fold"""". Don't have a clue how many editors might contribute to the upkeep of this, though.

Here are handy linx for you to peruse these pages, only the last 2 have reconstructed sidebars As Of This Writing (hereinafter """"AOTW""""):

January 2008 (works okay on my plat)

February 2008 (broken, so it's kludged)

March 2008 (okay)

April 2008 (okay)

May 2008 (works okay, International hols are an embarrassment [why just May?])

June 2008 (works OK)

July 2008 (breaks with prescribed table formatting, so it's kludged)

August 2008 (OK)

September 2008 (OK)

October 2008 (OK)

November 2008 (also breaks so it's kludged. Don't know what'll happen if we attempt to reconstruct & restore a local [temporally speaking ;)] sidebar)

December 2008 (Okay and complete, with the important comment that it's an archived section)

January 2009 (Also OK, as above)

So pass the word along that some spadework has been done, and it's as self-explanatory as I can manage to make it. Thanx again for all the great work on this design, unjustly neglected.

There are endless creative ways to provoke and capture sensual feelings. Money can’t buy it, you can’t see it or hold it, outer
packaging offers no competition for it and no grandiose flash of materialistic presence can incite it. Sensuality in it’s truest sense can only be felt within.  It is provoked by and through the power and brilliance of the mind. It is born there and lives there.

Since it is a feeling rather than a physical event, it is more difficult to achieve and maintain than might be found with other less deeply rooted sexual experiences.  Knowledge, intuition and creativity are the tools necessary to discover where it lives and how to awaken it, what it takes to stimulate it and how to nurture it so it will grow. A conscientious partner can create a need and cravings simply by using the power of the mind.    

All of this offers new meaning to the old adage about the mind being a terrible thing to waste. There are hot spots in the psyche that can be triggered by suggestion and connection. (Emotional Buttons)  Pushing those buttons engenders our partner's sensory and sexual experience. We do this by using one type of energy to spark another and by channeling emotional reactions into sexuality. Where the adventure leads is limited only by the knowledge, intuition and creativity an individual possesses. Nothing is written in stone and there is no list of how to’s.  It’s freelance flight.

Knowledge is power! Getting to know your partner and what makes her/him tick and tingle is the first step. The ability to
unearth these secret treasures comes from paying close attention to things you say or do that result in an action or reaction
indicating you have your finger on a button (hot spot). Finding all of those buttons, exploring the endless possibilities and
discovering the wondrous places they lead, takes patience and thought, but the rewards are immeasurable.

Having well honed intuition is a valuable asset. Liken it, if you will, to a good quarter back with a natural talent for reading the defense. If you ‘know’ what your partner needs, wants and desires without her/him having to explain it all, then you hold a powerful advantage. Possessing a good base knowledge of the opposite sex, in general, offers a continual win, win proposition

Being gifted with a creative imagination or obtaining skills in this arena will offer many positives for a lasting and pleasurable sex life. Desires and cravings are born in the mind and live there so it would make sense to use the power of the mind to it fullest to gain the greatest results. Spice and adventure are two major factors in all sexual experiences. If they are not on the top of your list of priorities then they should be. Avoiding boredom is key in creating cravings for more. If it wasn't good the first time, why would anyone want to repeat it?  Taking your partner to a place where she/he has never been before and making each experience a lasting memory should be primary goals. That is the stuff heroes are made of.

Sexual stimulation can be achieved and sustained through physical manipulation, sexual pleasures, or through mind play and manipulation A physical presence, a verbal exchange, a mere mental/emotional connection or any combination of all of the above can create an ‘altered mental state’, a place of arousal and euphoria.

Sensual/erotic tasks and journals are great avenues to maintain altered states. Rituals and sensual tasks , while away from your
partner can help keep the buttons pushed, the bond strong, keep the connection flowing and offer sexual stimulation on an
ongoing basis. Keeping your partner in an ‘altered state’ often and for as long as possible will help in creating cravings and lead to a path ultimate sexual pleasure.

Altered states....
1-Sexuality.....intensely 'turned on' riding a sexual high ...erotica.....consumed by passion
2-Endorphin high...... an altered state resulting from physical or intense mental stimulation.
3-Euphoria.....totally absorbed in your partner and the sensations and feelings being created.
5-Head space......spellbound/entranced..lost in the release of control..total freedom and flight..to be absorbed in the trust and acceptance..a peaceful place
6-Nirvana......meditative state.....heightened consciousness with loss of awareness.....having a sense of self through 'losing oneself'......total freedom through total loss of control.

All sexual experiences need to be consensual and remain safe.",0,0,0,0,0,0

698711cd09c1a39b,"Re-listing of Victoria Cross 

I have deleted the section under this heading that read: ‘Twenty-seven years after Murphy's death, in July 1920, the rules for the Victoria Cross award were changed to exclude forfeiture. The eight extant forfeits—including that of Murphy—were then re-listed in the Victoria Cross register’. The statement is in error and there was no reference to support the statement although similar statements have been made in respect to all the forfeited awards.

The VC warrant was not changed in July 1920 to exclude forfeitures. The present VC warrant still contains a forfeiture clause although the wording was modified in 1931. Since the original warrant in 1856, the monarch has had the power to restore a forfeited award but such power has never been exercised. The claim that the eight awards were relisted in the Victoria Cross Registrar refers to the War Office Alphabetical list of Victoria Cross recipients last issued in 1953. The names of the eight recipients who forfeited their awards are listed in that publication but their names were never deleted from earlier lists. Instead, both the 1920 list and the 1953 list include a note at the end of the list stating that the following 'whose names are included in the previous list forfeited the Victoria Cross under authority of the Royal Warrant quoted in each case’.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Wikinews Australia Day 

I notice you haven't been at Wikinews for a couple of weeks.  However there is an article stuck at the starting blocks for a couple of days that might benefit from another Australian taking a look, so I hope you don't mind my posting here at Wikipedia:

 Australia celebrates Australia Day 2009

(It reports on the cricket in Adelaide, if that interests you.)

  

It is now published.  Good luck for the ODI in Perth!   
Yeah, I pinged someone on IRC to review it, because I wasn't sure of the current standards. Regards,   

 Archived clarification 

 Perhaps I am missing something and you have been requested to archive this; however, as we are still in the middle of voting on motions here, could you please reinstate this?  Thanks.    
Once a motion reaches the majority (or in this case, the majority plus a couple), and has been that way for 24 hours, it is considered passed. Is there any special circumstance which allows you to request the passing of this motion to be delayed?   
The motions passed at 01:51 on today's date, which is less than 24 hours. As well, additional clarifications were made in the last 24 hours. I wouldn't call them """"special"""" circumstances, I expect them to remain on the page for at least the 24 hours after the motion passes so that the involved parties can read them.    
Oh, so you'd like me to restore them for three hours then, despite the fact that they are going to read them when I deliver the talk page notifications anyways? Go right ahead. Done. Please also note that in future, given this little piece of silliness by the Committee, everything is going to be archived right on time, and if any member of the Committee objects they need to show me a majority of the Committee supporting their viewpoint before they can do anything about it. It's this kind of ridiculousness—I'm going out in two hours and hence, given the votes over and beyond the majority, it has never been a problem to archive something 3 hours early with such strong support for the motions—that pisses me off about the Committee. We follow the Arbitration Committee procedures, and hence your observation that we need to be """"requested to archive this"""" in your initial comment is a patently incorrect line of thinking.
Ridiculous...   
To be more precise, the first motion passed with Newyorkbrad's abstention at 02:22 UTC, and there were two clarifying comments made to that motion following his vote, in part to address his concerns. You're certainly encouraged to have a life outside of Wikipedia; it's one of the reasons why we have a group of clerks instead of just one. If it's not convenient for you to take an action, I am sure that another member of the team will be happy to do so.    

Hi Daniel, sorry to toss another piece of bureaucracy at you, but since technically this was a clarification of the Martinphi-ScienceApologist case, shouldn't it be posted on that case's talkpage? onka 
No, because it served to amend the SlimVirgin case. I will post a link at the talk page of the Martinphi-ScienceApologist case to where the motions are archived, but given the Martinphi-SA case wasn't the one being clarified or altered, it's correct residence is the SlimVirgin talk page.

The problem of LTI is difficult because many BSEEs forget what it is after leaving class. So we have to be very grammatically careful to write clearly for even a technical audience. Memristors are linear when solving a circuit at one point in time, which is an important bit of linearity. Essentially LTI theory developed to describe what Fourier/Laplace transforms and LCR circuits and can do. So it's surprising to an EE that a fundamental passive element would not work in that theory. But it's not important to a non EE. So we have to phrase it such that a non EE will gloss over and an EE stops and says, """"what does that mean again?""""

The RMS Titanic was an Olympic-class passenger liner owned by British shipping company White Star Line and built at the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast, United Kingdom. For her time, she was the largest passenger steamship in the world.

On the night of 14 April 1912, during the ship's maiden voyage, Titanic hit an iceberg and sank two hours and forty minutes later, early on 15 April 1912. The sinking resulted in the deaths of 1,517 people, making it one of the deadliest peacetime maritime disasters in history. The high casualty rate was due in part to the fact that, although complying with the regulations of the time, the ship did not carry enough lifeboats for everyone aboard. The ship had a total lifeboat capacity of 1,178 people, although her capacity was 3,547. A disproportionate number of men died due to the women-and-children-first protocol that was followed.

The Titanic used some of the most advanced technology available at the time and was popularly believed to have been described as """"unsinkable.""""[6] It was a great shock to many that, despite the extensive safety features and experienced crew, the Titanic sank. The frenzy on the part of the media about Titanic's famous victims, the legends about the sinking, the resulting changes to maritime law, and the discovery of the wreck have contributed to the continuing interest in, and notoriety of, the Titanic.

 Romeo and Juliet comparison 

This is the quote I found from the source given (the other source seems to be a dead link):
""""""""Our story line is maybe not the most original or creative, but it's Shakespearean,"""" said Borden, who described the plot as a modern version of Romeo and Juliet. """"We took from the best.""""""""

I see this has been discussed before and there doesn't seem to be a conclusion, so let me give my two cents. The story of a boy and a girl falling in love with each other but not getting their way is probably the most common theme in the world, and that's the only resemblance between those the movie and Romeo and Juliet. There's an enormous difference - Romeo and Juliet is a tragedy, for one. Let's just say that this movie is nothing like Romeo and Juliet.

Moreover, if you have a basic knowledge of Shakespeare, you will know that Shakespeare created nothing. His story of Romeo and Juliet comes from an earlier story of the same name, which in turn comes from the Metamorphoses by Ovid, who probably heard the story as a folktale. His other tragedies - Hamlet, King Lear - are the same. The true excellence of Shakespeare is in his ability to transform them masterfully into blank verse. It has nothing to do with creativity, and here Borden is awfully wrong to claim that the best is Shakespeare's plot - which has been around for centuries. It shows a lack of basic knowledge about what he supposedly based his story on.

All this raises doubt to the amount of truth in Borden's claim that he based it on Romeo and Juliet - is it babbling, or is he simply ignorant? We do not know. But we do know that his comparison is, at best, doubtful. Yes, it is a verifiable source, it comes from the writer's own mouth, and it is not my place to judge him wrong, but it is also against the principle of common sense to make the comparison in an encyclopedia based on one sentence out of the writer's mouth - as far as I know, no one yet has made this comparison and no one seems to see the same way. I would suggest moving the sentence below to the plotline as """"The writer of the play claimed that..."""" as it is not exactly a notable claim either (nowhere else in the article is it mentioned, except briefly in what I believe is an OR sentence). Or, better, remove it.   
I think the editor seemed to feel that what Borden said was sufficient. I'd be a little dubious because; besides it being possibly self-promotion, the only thing we can grab without a shadow of a doubt that (like what you said about the Bard) they weren't that creative.    

Ok - I have now posted 5 more references not from the author, but from mainstream critics who easily saw the similar elements. I also fixed the dead link. I also retooled the sentence to say that both the author and numerous critics have made the same (or similar) description.  As to the obvious similarities: meeting at a party, a balcony scene, each has their """"gangs"""", the thwarting of a parents will, rival cliques instead of rival gangs is also referenced by 3 different critics. May this be the end to this conversation now? Thanks for allowing me to post more references.  Please read them all and you might learn something.  
Oh yes - of course their are elements of Grease and West Side Story - They too were based on elements of the R&J; story. I feel silly even having to point this stuff out, but it keeps coming up. Let's see - Grease wasn't a tragedy either (except its message of """"dress and act like a slut and you will be accepted"""".  Shakespeare created nothing? Gee, I guess that is why R&J; is perhaps the most adapted play of all time. See the wiki article on Romeo and Juliet on screen just for a taste of what the play has inspired.  No one has adapted Ovid and few have even read Romeus and Iuliet (I have though - has anyone on this page read it?). I sincerely doubt if Bordon or many critics have. And just so you know - Shakespeare did indeed add to the plot and created characters that hav",0,0,0,0,0,0

This article will never be a FA nor a good article. It also had been the victim of some wikipedia rules that don't apply to other articles on this encyclopedia. When I first started to edit on wiki I was quite enthusiastic but later this feeling faded. For example the artcle had been moved to a name that is not used in the world of football. Steaua had always been known for its official name: FC Steaua Bucureşti. This name is used worldwide to refer to Steaua. I personally found this situation annoying and I suggest that a move should take place. I mean, the other Romanian football clubs with Bucureşti in their naming were not moved and those awkward wikipedia rules applied only to this article. 

Here are some examples about football clubs that have articles based on their official club names:

 Sporting Clube de Portugal
 Associação Académica de Coimbra - O.A.F.
 F.C. Internazionale Milano
 Olympique Lyonnais
 Deportivo de La Coruña
 Club de Gimnasia y Esgrima La Plata

 WorldNet TPS 

Hi,

It appears that you have deleted a page which I had created. The page was titled 'WorldNet TPS'. I feel it was unfairly deleted.

The purpose of the page is to provide Wikipedia users with some background/history regarding WorldNet TPS. WorldNet is the second largest payment service provider in Ireland and it is important that web users who choose not to use the WorldNet website (worldnettps.com) can access information regarding the company on the most popular encyclopaedia in the world.

I would like you to review your decision to delete the WorldNet TPS page.

Kind Regards,

Mark  — Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

 The page was nominated for deletion as explained on your talk page because but it did not indicate how or why the subject is important or significant. There were no independent sources to establish notability. Please see Wikipedia:Your first article for guidance.  talk 

Would these documents suffice as notability?

It's not really up to me to decide, although one of the links is a blog and another a press release so probably not. I didn't delete the article, I nominated it for deletion and an admin then reviewed it and deleted it. Check out the link I gave you above and if you think you can establish notability you can recreate the article - this time properly referenced or you can submit an Article for Creation so that it can be reviewed before being created.

 From the Members
Welcome to the Ninth issue of the WikiProject Christianity newsletter! Use this newsletter as a mechanism to inform yourselves about progress at the project and please be inspired to take more active roles in what we do.  

I am in the process of going through the various categories related to Christianity. I am finding that several of them may not have sufficient number of members to continue. By the end of the month, I hope to have the main category list finished (yeah, it might take that long, it's huge). At that time, I think we will review all the categories and see which may not have sufficient articles to continue. Please feel free to take part in the discussion regading what the minimum number of category items is, and how to deal with the non-qualifying categories, on the General Forum page.

I guess you're doing the same thing as me - working through the Category:Pages with missing references list to correct them.

I don't want to bitch, but it does seem that on more than one occasion you've been too hasty, and committed without checking results.  For instance The Grapes of Wrath (film) - it quite clearly states at the end what the problem was (needed a ) but all you did was insert another  immediately before the one that was there, which didn't cure anything. 

I take this exercise as an opportunity to apply other edits to the article too, if it grabs my fancy.  So in this example (The Grapes of Wrath (film)) the simple solution would be just to do what the error message tells you.  But the longer solution, and probably what the original author wanted, is to remove the group name from the .

I would say no. But I might have to change my mind if you can find it in a reputable source, other than a typo.  

I first found it in the Lisp 1.5 Programmer's manual, there both boolean and boolian are used. Searching google shows that both are in use. Other two links where both spellings are used: Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics, A catalogue and guide to the Charles S. Peirce Papers

 """"boolean"""" or """"Boolean"""" 

I believe that the spelling of """"boolean"""" should be standardized to be de-capitalized when used in a sentence.  Example: Boolean algebra simplifies circuits.  However, they are expressed in boolean expression.  The word """"boolean"""" appears to be derived from the person's name George Boole, and just like """"diesel"""" is derived from the person Rudolf Christian Karl Diesel, """"volt"""" from the person Volta, and so on.   
Well, language isn't always as neatly regular as you might like it to be. The standard usage in mathematics has a capital B, therefore we use a capital B. In computer science, sometimes it's lowercase, and that's OK too.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

How did you decide that bukkake always implies a female subject? 

Also, just because a word has a historical meaning doesn't mean that it can't ever mean anything else as culture develops. The word rap meant """"to knock, as on a door"""" up until the late 70s for example. Would you deny the more modern use of the term? The English language has no board to regulate it, as French does with the L'Académie française, so you have no basis for defining what the word means. We have groups and documents that define the proper use of words like """"you're"""" and """"your"""", for example, but none such for words like bukkake. If it can be shown that it is used in a particular way, that is valid. My personal belief is that there is no need for the qualifier """"gay"""", just as there is no need to call men having anal sex """"gay anal sex"""", but that's really irrelevent. 

I think it is important to make clear the historical implications, but not to deny that we are currently creating and modifying language. Even the fact that we have taken the word bukkake, """"splash"""", from Japan and created this very specific connotation of splashing not just anything, but specifically semen and specifically onto a person's face shows that this term is elastic and subject not to rules that we impose on it, but by the meaning that it has to the people who use it.

Which beats making masses of blogs,  etc, as an easy way to gain good visibility for one's site. See Google bomb,  20:07, August 2, 2005 (UTC)

Byšičky
I believe that it is actually a village, though it is part of Lysa. In English a village does not always have a seperate political identity. Check out this page - It identifies it as both a village and part of Lysa:

http://www.senat.cz/volby/hledani/o_casti_obce.php?kod=89648

I think that it deserves its own page - even though politically it is Lysa. I rode my bike there from Kareny and it was surrounded by countryside, not obviously part of Lysa, but a seperate settlement. There should be a link on the Lysa page to Byšičky, though.

 Failed Edits Problem 

I was browsing a forum in which a number of Wikipedians were discussing the failed edit problem. And I think that I have the solution.

From what I understand, the problem could result from human error. Many people, when editing, have a number of windows open on an article. They enter an edit to one window, and then, without refreshing their browser, edit that same page again, negating the original edit with their save.... 

Hope this helps,  

Yeah. You're right actually about it's prevalence. It's quite ironic that it happened to me while I was posting about it. Don't you think?

 deletion of redirects per Wikipedia:Naming conventions (schools) 

The issue has gotten contentious for one redirect in particular for Uni High.  There's been an Rfd for days nowand I've said that I'd be fine with keeping it, but only if there was a particular reason to.  We are forming guideslines etc, and while a look at the ones in place helped form them, I'll definitely admit that I could have overlooked stuff.  But the current discussion has been going round and round and the person who wants the redirect kept is arguing two things (it seems).  One is that keeping the redirect will prevent article duplication.  And the other is that it will help people find the article.

In my point of view, both of these arguments make no sense, as the article in question was moved from name of school plus paramater to name of school plus different parameter.  There are half a dozen different paramaters that could be used easily, so the idea that people are going to naturally gravitate towards the one that did happen to exist and want to create an article there, or search that way doesn't make sense.  If the person really thinks that that's a problem, then they should have created other redirects from the other possible namespaces for the article.  If you could take a look at the discussionI'd appreciate it.  I may be missing something, we may want to change the guidelines per different things that have been raised (notability of the city was raised, which we don't outright address because I didn't think we would need to but we probably should).

Alsoit occured to me that there's no WP shortcut for the guideline, which I assume would belong at WP:NC(SCH).  We should create the shortcut, no?    talk  20:46, May 18 2007""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Attachment to the First Canadian Army 

In the Normandy section it says: """"The unit was attached to the First Canadian Army. This may have been done to help in communication, as the vast majority of Poles did not speak English when they arrived in UK from 1940 onwards.""""

So does this mean that: 1) they wanted the Poles subordinated to an English-speaking unit for command and control purposes, rather than operating independently, or that 2) there were sufficient numbers of Polish-language speakers in the Canadian Army to act as translators?

There's no reference linked to this assertion.

 Three phases of post-WWII relationships between Romania and the Soviet Union 

OK, I've done some research and I'm sure I still don't know as much as the rest of you but at least I am not as much of an ignoramus as I was a few hours ago.

I've looked at a number of online resources, most of them non-scholarly, but I think it's enough to get a feel for what the situation is.  The source that I found most useful is: this one.

It's clear that there were at least three phases of relationship between Romania and the Soviet Union after WWII.  The first was """"legal occupation"""" between 1944 and 1946/47.  As Hamish and Prete say, """"The occcupation lasted legally from the signature of the armistice until February 1947, when peace treaties were signed in Paris...""""

The next phase of the relationship involves a nominally independent Romania that is """"closely aligned"""" with the Soviet Union and COMECON.  As for Soviet troops, Hamish and Prete say """"[after 1947], Soviet troops remained, but on a different legal basis, in Romania and Hungary.  The official reason was that (the Soviets) needed to control communications between the Soviet Union and Soviet occupation forces in Austria.  This reason disappeared with the conclusion of the Austrian State Treaty in 1955.  Instead, Soviet forces remained as Allied troops, and their status was more precisely defined with the signature in 1958 of the Warsaw Pact.""""

Now, we know that the Soviet troops were pulled out of Romania in 1958 and that Ceausescu took Romania on a path that diverged from COMECON but still remained enough in Khruschev's good graces that Romania never suffered a military incursion as Hungary or Czechoslovakia did.

The point here is that there are at least three phases of relationship between Romania and the Soviet Union.  The relationship between 1944 and 1946/47 was clearly one of occupation.  After 1958, everyone agrees that there was no more occupation of Romania.  However, between 1946/47 and 1958, it's not clear what people call it.  As Hamish and Prete state, the """"legal occupation"""" ended.  As cited here and in Soviet occupation of Romania, some sources state that the """"Soviet occupation"""" ended in 1958.  Others call it a """"virtual occupation"""".  Why virtual?  Because it had all the earmarks of an occupation except that it wasn't officially one.  (And thus my argument that we shouldn't call it an occupation because it wasn't one.)

What's the solution?  Here's my proposal...

First, stop getting caught up in what the title of the article says.  Let the Soviet occupation of Romania article remain where it is.  Mention the entire period of 1944-1958 under this title (i.e. Soviet occupations) but make it clear that there were three phases of relationship and, as I described it, """"the period from 1946/47 to 1958 had many of the characteristics of an occupation but was not legally considered to be an occupation"""".  Also add that many historians follow the lead of the Romanian government in calling the entire period from 1944-1958 an occupation by the Soviet Union.  

However, also note that it is unclear whether this characterization is used by """"most historians"""", """"many historians"""" or """"some historians"""".  In Soviet occupation of Romania, the text says """"most Western historians"""" but the references simply provide a handful of sources that use the word """"occupation"""" to refer to the period 1944-1958.  As someone argued, this could be just cherry-picking.  To support the assertion that """"most Western historians consider the period 1944-1958 to be a Soviet occupation"""", you have to find a source that says exactly that i.e. the text has to say """"most Western historians blah, blah, blah"""".  Failing that, using the word """"most"""" is OR.  Much better to say """"many"""" or just """"some"""".

ffd65e1dc79fbd26,"I agree and the additions have made this a much more useful and potentially accurate article. I'm happy with that and again, understand the Comyn version makes NO sense...they were bitter enemies of the Clan Chattan, there is no dispute there. Also, again, show me somewhere that even shows David Dhu was a son of a Comyn because I don't see that anywhere, it never happened. Somebody just puts someone has a son named David and voila, this David formed the Davidson's, but another brother formed the Cummings?? This makes no sense at all. If you did reach out to Clan Davidson, that was a wise thing to do. Who they say they descend from carries much more weight than others who might have an interest in slandering their name. It sounds like there might be a jealous Macintosh or Macpherson or someone in recent history who decided to corrupt the origins. I couldn't even speculate why, unless it has something to do with titles or land. Someone made a stupid comment about dna and how we are all mixed anyway....excuse me, we are talking Male/Paternal YDNA...which DOES NOT mix. It mutates but it passes generation to generation. Autosomal dna is a mix and true, if you go back thousands of years the YDNA that makes up your total dna, from back in the days of the Clans, would be a tiny percent of your total genetic makeup. However, we are strictly talking YDNA here and it would be nice if the current chiefly line would consider testing, and perhaps one of his sons will, or a cousin...we'll have to see. To close, I'm sorry you respect Quintus, he is a dip-stick and he needs to keep his dirty little hands of the Clans because he isn't making them better, he's ruining them. He's butchered a few other Clans that I didn't even mention. I think one is Clan Grant...I think he's calling them Norman too...that is a huge insult, they are one of the founding Clans from Dalriada/Pictland along with the MacGregors...tell him to leave the clans alone and go back to Dungeons and Dragons or Final Fantasy.

Also, who exactky are you trying to help with this idea, you and your other insane evil dictator friends, because there are about several billion other people here too who dont appreciate getting every right taken away from them and having somebody try to tell them who they are and what they shuld do and that their dreams aren;t important and that they should be freaking governmant scapegoats and sacrifice their right to speak and everything else jsut so that a group of like a dozen self-absorbed people can get what they want.

Your response confirms to me that you have obviously sided with the other users who attacked me. Perhaps Users such as Blixx are good friends of yours. Given this then it is impossible for me to get treated fairly as you are apparently biased towards them. I find it astounding that you have gone to great lengths to supress my views by blocking me from editing, blocking me from contacting the head as well as yourself and for added measure you have blocked me from emailing. All because I complained about my treatment, lets face it the excuse about me edit warring is just a smokescreen, you just don't like it when I diagree with a point of view. Are you following the orders of Blixx and co? Yet you make no mention of their personal attacks and abuse on me - they have called me 'a nasty piece of work', 'an islamist', 'Haddad's puppet' etc. Have you even warned them? I think not.

There have been 144 non-self nominations for users with more than 2,000 edits*. There have been 38 self-noms. The success rate of non-self noms is 83%. For self noms, it's 68%, a 15% difference. If you want me to nominate you, I'd be willing to consider you against . My standards to nominate are possibly the strictest around. First, you need to clear 3,000 edits. Note that those standards are for me to nominate; they do not affect how I vote on a nomination. Based on your average # of edits over the last 30 days, you should reach 3,000 edits by the end of this month. Your current average # of edits per day overall is 12.65.

* - I did  of 126 nominations from late June to mid-September. I found a glaring difference in the success of nominees with <2000 edits vs. >2000 edits. That's why I limited my success comparison of self/non-self noms to users with >2000 edits, as <2000 edits is a different case.

Your actions have shown contempt for consensus and the community in a manner that I've almost never seen before. That you did this at ITN, where things are so much more laid back than in many parts of the project, makes this abuse even more shocking, which is the reason I've extended your block. I will say the following once, and once only: if you ever particiapte in the same discussion on Wikipedia under two identities, logged in or not, in an attempt to stack votes, I will block you indeifnitely and make a motion for a community ban.

Thank you for putting that vandalism notice on 69.118.94.155's talkpage. This anon has done this countless times, won't listen to reason, and just vandalized my userpage . Please keep a close eye on him!   

Thank you for the block. He was being quite immature, there.

Thank you for reverting all of  Rainbow Sneakers 

I requested a check user, and I've found Po132 and Minun132 are the same person and Iloveminun and PokemonFan are the same person. What should I do now?  Rainbow Sneakers 

PokemonFan was used vote in a controversial TfD after Iloveminun (who nominated the template) got told to stop voting delete. PokemonFan also vandalised the user page of the admin taking part in the vote who wouldn't delete it for him. It's more of a larger problem by Iloveminun, who is trying to replace Serebii, a valued and incredibly useful website most of the actually reference, from hundreds of Pokémon articles (first he tried to remove the template that links to it manually, then from the template that produces references in all the Pokémon articles and replace it with his own website, Pokémon Galaxy. Pokémon Galaxy is not at present even finished, but it seems to be pushing it. Which is how I got caught in everything. (Bit odd how I caught the real sockpuppet when I was originally way off) Thanks,  Rainbow Sneakers 

I will. Is Minun132 being abusive? Hmm, I had missed that. Thank you for the offer, I will wait for your return since this is a new situation for me. Thanks again,  Rainbow Sneakers 

Nah, I'm writing I'm just ill. And getting sidetracked. It's nearly done. Cheers,  Rainbow Sneakers 
Is there any particular way to do it? Or do I just note notarize the points and link to the evidence?  Rainbow Sneakers 

Done, you can find it here. Sorry for the wait, I'm feeling bad and Mailer Diablo and I were discussing FAC problems. Cheers,  Rainbow Sneakers 

We did it! Thank you for all the help, I feel slightly embarrassed that someone who has been here a month in so much more knowledgable than I am in certain aspects. If you ever need a hand with something (Fair use, FAC, GA) just drop me a bell. Cheers,  Rainbow Sneakers

 """"No one can know how we feel if we do not say. We cannot expect to get understanding if we do not ask for it. No one will dispute that sometimes life's issues are too much for one person. It is fair to say that sometimes Wikipedia's problems fall under the same heading. This is a place where you can bring the bruises that can sometimes be got on this project for attention."""" Stress AlertsThe Stress alerts program aims at identifying users who are stressed, alerting the community of thier stress and works in tandem with the Stressbusters at trying to identify causes of stress and eliminating them. Note from the editorWelcome to this new format of the Esperanza Newsletter, which came about during the last Advisory Council meeting - we hope you like it! The major changes are that each month, right after the Council meeting, this will be sent out and will include two featured programs and a sum up of the meeting. Also, it will be signed by all of the Advisory Council members, not just . Have an Esperanzial end of March, everyone!

 Unique Structure of Regional Government in Ontario 

This arcticle was started and then there where edits and discussions about moving it to its own page. It's been deleted but I thing another attempt should be made to crete a new one whith everyone working hamoniously to reach a consensus. Its a rather important and interesting piece.  The structure was set in place in 1970's and it is still running its course in Ontario shaing the face of Ontario and therefore all of Canada in the eyes of the world. I would therefore propose we bring back the frame of the article that was sarted and link the Nine Regions to it.Wiki BADASS Woo 2U """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Alissahart!

I have put together a survey for female editors of Wikipedia (and related projects) in order to explore, in greater detail, women's experiences and roles within the Wikimedia movement. It'd be wonderful if you could participate!

It's an independent survey, done by me, as a fellow volunteer Wikimedian. It is not being done on behalf of the Wikimedia Foundation. I hope you'll participate!

Just click this link to participate in this survey, via Google!

Any questions or concerns, feel free to email me or stop by my user talk page. Also, feel free to share this any other female Wikimedians you may know. It is in English, but any language Wikimedia participants are encouraged to participate.
I appreciate your contributions - to the survey and to Wikipedia! Thank you!",0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm not sure if its the same anon, as the article was deleted, so there is no edit history, but if you still think it should be deleted, perhaps putting it through AfD would be more fair.

Although Ken Barnes is a fucking moron, we need more criticism to balance it out
Hi, As one of the primary authors of this page, I want to make it absolutely clear that I in no way agree with the ridiculous statements made in the citation I added from """"rock critic"""" Ken Barnes. Having contributed nothing to music himself, it is outrageous that he would have the nerve to attack what is arguably the greatest Queen album. Nonetheless, we need criticism as well in order to better balance the article out. I have also added many wonderful things lately, such as Freddie's top listings in international polls, so don't worry too much. I also want to make it clear that, although I cite """"Rolling Stone"""" a lot, I basically consider it to be a magazine for people who are musically illiterate. Forgive me, Freddie!

Note that not only has the fair use image in the BLP infobox been removed (currently approved practice, I believe, though the image adhered to """"policy"""" when it was originally uploaded), now fair use images of film posters/video covers in sections on those films/videos have been removed as """"decorative"""", even though they still fit current """"policy"""" (or at least """"policy"""" last I checked). Unless all film posters are removed from all articles on films, this is a biased removal. Not that I give a fuck, of course, because I've seen this kind of shit go on and on and on here, and it is one of the reasons I have come to the realisation that it is a complete waste of time to contribute content here. Wikipedia is only a place to chat and troll. I just mention this to you because you seem to be one of the few Admins who does seem to give a fuck, occasionally.   """,1,0,1,0,0,0
b6c222c3225bc8ae,"""STOP DELETING MY ADDITION!  You, Muboshgu/Mephistophelian say:

Please do not use talk pages ... for general discussion of the topic. They are
for discussion related to improving the article. They are not to be used as a
forum or chat. If you continue to use talk pages as you do, you may be blocked
from editing. You are using the talk page to push a POV rather than addressing
the article in a constructive manner. Please stop.

I AM NOT """"generally discussing a topic"""", I AM NOT """"chatting"""". I AM NOT
""""pushing a P.O.V."""".  If you do not understand basic English grammar, you have
no business telling me anything.  FACT: commas are used in this context to
separate a list, a series, of related clauses.  Grammar is not a matter of a
""""general discussion"""" or """"chatting"""" or a """"point of view"""".  It is a technically
precise set of rules, and in this case, a set of rules that demonstrate that
the foundation of the issue is a fraud.  THIS IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT, IT
IS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE, IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE.  I AM TALKING
ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE
RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING
ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.

FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):

 There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal
knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.

 make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being
friendly is a great help.

 It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to
voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it.

 Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article;

 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to
verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns
discussed.

 The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.

 New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion
by other editors if you wish.

 Do not threaten people: For example, ...
having them banned for disagreeing with you.

 removing others' comments is sometimes allowed.
But you should ... stop if there is any objection.

As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public
since there is no """"natural born citizen"""" requirement that is applicable today.
That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible
to the Office of President; neither shall any
person be eligible to that Office who shall not
have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and
been fourteen Years a Resident within the United
States.

I haven't been around the page much lately (sick of haggling over trivialities), but the last time I checked the lead was largely the one written my Mathsci (which I had tweaked a bit after the mediation was over).  As for my redactions, they were surgical, (carefully removing personal comments without affecting the meaning of the sentence), and mostly affected TechnoFaye (whose mouth consistently runneth over).  I redacted Mathsci's comments 3 or 4 times, as well as comments from several others - it had no impact on the discussion except to remove inflammatory wording.

Occam, Arthur is trying to insinuate that I'm guilty of some sort of malfeasance without actually coming straight out and accusing me of malfeasance, because has no evidence (or even a decent reason to believe) that I've done something wrong.  Plus, he thinks we're all too stupid to recognize that he's being uncivil when he does it indirectly like this.  If he wants to make an explicit argument against me out of this mess of hand-waving, let him.  As soon as he does, I'll take him to ANI and request he be blocked for gross incivility.  If he just wants to keep insinuating then he's got a toothless argument that you can safely poo-poo in proper Victorian style.  Ludwigs2 """,1,0,0,0,0,0

 Worst Season ever 
Anyone who likes Seasons 4 and onward have obviously NOT seen any of the old episodes from 1999-2004 and therefore is a total dickbag. I can never tell you how much I HATE the new SpongeBob!!! Nick had stopped caring about good animation and started caring only about the cash the SECOND they started this show. The old ones are great, while the new ones, I'd give an F plus 500 million minuses! I'd be so damn shocked if anybody even likes these new episodes, because anyone who does is downright retarded. It's like all Nick's staff wants to do now is win themselves a bunch of hot girls!

When the stooges at Nick began this show, it was nothing but great humor for 5 years. Now, SpongeBob's crew had lost ANY sight of what """"good quality"""" is all about! The writing is totally fucked up! I mean, Seriously, """"For Here or To Go""""? Who the fucking hell would watch an episode about taking orders at a fast food restaurant deciding whether or not to eat it at the restauraunt or home? I know there are now just copying off ideas of old episodes. Ex: Petsitter Pat. Patrick says the bath is gonna come to Gary. That's EXACTLY what SpongeBob said to Gary in """"Gary Takes a Bath"""", but that version is WAAAAAAY better than this new junk that anybody likes is mentally challenged and obviously hasn't watched the first three seasons! Even true SpongeBob fans should only like Season 1-3, because no episodes past that were even remotely decent. And I know for a fact it will never be as good as it used to be. I'm 100% certain that is true. ANYBODY who likes anything of the Post Movie era is just either brain-dead or childish. Stephen Hillenburg really knew quality, but now we just have a bunch of screwed-up polesmokers who only want the money. And NOTHING else! They're just like fucking Mr. Krabs clones! Paul Tibbit must be drunk or something, and Tom Kenny must have swallowed a slide whistle, because now SpongeBob is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING EXCEPT FOR UTTER GARBAGE THAT IS ALL BUT INTOLERABLE!!! Like I said, I cannot believe there are people that actually LIKE these new episodes! Everybody that likes Seasons 4-8 smoke too much crack! Anybody who's into the new SpongeBob doesn't know shit about quality if it hit him square in the ballsack! All I can say is, I am SO RELIEVED this show is ending in 2014. Only 2 more years of this trash that I will have to sit through! If they make a SpongeBob Channel, they should only do reruns of the first three seasons, because absolutely nothing afterwards was good. So there goes 7 years of my life I know I will never get back. I am not going to wait too much longer for them to cancel this unfunny garbage, because it needs to happen soon.71.74.87.105

This needed to be clarified since there has been a problem with him inserting subsequent posts ahead of mine, which can be misleading to a reader. When I tried to correct the positions yesterday in another incident, here is what he wrote in his edit summary when he positioned his post ahead of mine again:

01:57, 13 May 2010 The Magnificent Clean-keeper (talk | contribs) m (180,836 bytes) (Undid revision 361800511 by Zlykinskyja (talk)Don't fucking move my comments again. This is plain vandalism) (undo)

So when I objected to his use again of the word """"fucking"""" he then used it at me two more times, as reflected above. This follows a prior incident a few weeks ago when he used the word """"fucking"""" at me. I repeatedly objected and asked him not to do that. I think he did this again because he knew it would upset me because of how upset I was about the prior incident. 

Also, I have been called by someone else a """"bitch"""" and the words """"cunt"""" and """"cock"""" """"shit"""" have been directed at me on this Talk page. I have repeatedly objected and nothing is done. It is as if women who want to contribute here have to put up with a gauntlet of abuse if they wish to stay here.

I think your job are wonderful, blocking people, wow, how many people you did it? Many, it is because that many people come here to complain about you, is not easy being a stupid person like you is. You know? Good work, keep blocking people, I thought that the policy of Wikipedia is to be free, but not with you here.
