The threshold for inclusion in Wikipedia of any entry is  verifiability, not truth—that is, whether readers are able to check that material added to Wikipedia has already been published by a reliable source, not whether we think it is true. Editors should provide a reliable source for quotations and for any material that is challenged or likely to be challenged, or the material may be removed. Wikipedia:Verifiability is one of Wikipedia's core content policies, along with Wikipedia:No original research and Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.

They should not be interpreted in isolation from one another, and editors should therefore familiarize themselves with all three.

If you look at template:cite book you can see the parameters for a template that defines a cited book.  I always use this template (or others like template:cite journal or template:cite web) because they automatically put the different bits of information into the right format.  template:sfn gives a way to easily make a reference and footnote that link to the cited source, thus:

Displays as:

The trick here is that the """"cite book"""" template includes """"|ref=harv"""" which tells the template to make a footnote from the author's last name and the year of the book, e.g. """"Smith 2009"""", and link it to the book definition.  That may not always be possible, because the author's name and/or publication year may be unknown, in which case you can tell the template what name to use for the footnote, as in  |ref={{harvid|Norwegian Blue}}

You do not have to rate the article if you do not want to, others will do it eventually. Those templates are very useful, as they bring the articles to a WikiProject attention, and allow them to start tracking the articles through Wikipedia:Article alerts and other tools.

A year ago India was scarred by some of the worst sectarian violence since partition, when up to 2,000 Muslims were killed in pogroms in the western state of Gujarat, ostensibly sparked by an arson attack by Muslims on a train that killed 59 Hindu activists. Human rights organisations in India, the US and Europe implicated two organisations in the well-orchestrated attacks, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP or World Hindu Council) and its youth offshoot, the Bajrang Dal (devotees of the monkey-god Hanuman).

Now a Financial Times investigation has established that these groups receive extensive funding from Indians abroad, collected mainly as tax-free charity donations to front organisations in the US and the UK. This fundraising is coming under increasing scrutiny. So it should - as should the links between these groups and India's ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP).

Behind the VHP and the Bajrang Dal stands a quasi-paramilitary body, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS or Association of National Volunteers), which is the mother organisation of the Hindu revivalist BJP. Described by Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first prime minister, as """"an Indian version of fascism"""", the RSS is at the centre of a protean network of front organisations. This structure facilitates arm's-length money-raising. It also makes it easier for the RSS to deny it is inciting agitation against Muslims and Christians.....................................The RSS spends heavily on welfare and religious schools, but so do Islamist groups in the Muslim world - a danger the world has woken up to. Such ostensibly charitable activities are one reason for the groups' success. They also help pull in donations from people unaware of how some of their money is used.

The UK is formally investigating two RSS fundraising affiliates, and is considering an inquiry into the VHP. The US has also started carefully scrutinising RSS front organisations. That probe should go ahead unimpeded by Washington's ambition to develop a strategic alliance with India as a counterbalance to China's weight in Asia.

Why have you changed the image again? The text is now all but unreadable. It is now forced into single-word lines, extending down past the reference section. ,It looks ridiculous. You quoted IMGSIZE, yet again, in the summary. That policy states:
 In general, do not use px without very good reason

What that means is, the policy needs not to be unilaterally enforced at all costs. If, as in this instance, there is a need for a change in size, it is permissible. The policy further states:
Where px is used, the resulting image should be no more than 500 pixels tall and no more than 400 pixels wide, for comfortable display on the smallest devices in common use.

I have already (and repeatedly) demonstrated that upsizing to 250px is all that required. (I bet even 220px would work). That is well within the limits. The change to the picture itself is negligible, and therefore does not impact the article negatively in any way. It only servers to benefit the article by making the text within the caption more wieldy and easier to read. It also eliminates the impact of needlessly extending the picture frame all the way down to the refs.

Surely you can see this. Since you're quoting this policy so much, surely you know that it does not prohibit this edit. I have asked repeatedly that you look at the effect on the article, both before and after the edit, and in doing so,. surely you see the need for this edit.

They don't allow edits they don't like to stay up for more than 30 minutes, and their tactic is to bully and threaten people until they give up. Of course people do give up, because they become exhausted and worn down as nothing they try to correct will stay up. Interestingly enough, some of these people also police pages on subjects such as Aspartame and alternative medicine. It's frightening how the AIDS orthodoxy doesn't want the public to know the facts. Most horrifying is the effect on AIDS patients themselves, who have the right to know everything there is to know and to make their own choices. I'd be interested to know your uncle's history, whether he was taking AIDS medications, what AIDS-related disease he actually died from, etc. AIDS has turned into a fear campaign - they give you a death sentence, and tell patients that if they stop the drugs that they will die.

Essentially, landforms are the product of erosive processes on the existing structure of the rocks involved and cannot be understood or explained without a good understanding of the geologic structure of the rocks. A geologist trying to decipher the structural geology of a region begins by studying the clues in the landforms. All is related. Now, there is a tendency of some geographers to think that geomorphology is a subdivision of geography and try to explain landforms without a thorough understanding of the structure, petrology, and stratigraphy on which the surface landforms develop. Landforms cannot be understood without knowledge of the geology on which they are formed.

Especially as it regards to such controversial operations, (the USAF investigating the actions of the USAF are akin to the police investigating the conduct of police officers - heavy bias is inevitable). Further more, it may be argued that such a source violates WP:Primary Source.
Batvette, the """"air force historical society[sic] analysis of Dresden firebombing that you have provided place's some emphasis on the military value of Dresden as a target for strategic bombing. It refers to Dresden's value as a transport and communications hub, (see para II). It also refers to """"[s]pecific military installations in Dresden in February 1945 included barracks and hutted camps and at least one munitions storage depot"""", (see para II.10). Perversely, one of the arguments suggested for legitimising the bombing was the fact that Dresden """"was protected by antiaircraft defenses, antiaircraft guns and searchlights"""", (see para 11). I'm not at all sure what to make of that bizarre reference.
I have C&P; a relevant section from the Wikipaedia page on the Dresden firebombing. Please note, I have no idea what the rule is on C&Ping; the content of another Wikipaedia article to the talkpage of another Wikipaedia article. If this is a breach of any Wikipaedia policy please feel free to let me know (unless you're my stalker):

The historian Alexander McKee has cast doubt on the meaningfulness of the list of targets mentioned in 1953 USAAF report and point out that the military barracks listed as a target were a long way out of town and not in fact targeted during the raid.McKee (1983), p. 61,62 The 'hutted camps' mentioned in the report as military targets were also not military but were provided for refugees. It is also pointed out that the important Autobahn bridge to the west of the city was not targeted or attacked and that no railway stations were on the British target maps, nor were the bridges, such as the railway bridge spanning the Elbe River.McKee (1982), pp.62,63. Commenting on this Alexander McKee stated that: """"The standard whitewash gambit, both British and American, is to mention that Dresden contained targets X, Y and Z, and to let the innocent reader assume that these targets were attacked, whereas in fact the bombing plan totally omitted them and thus, except for one or two mere accidents, they escaped""""McKee (1983), p.61. McKee further asserts, """"The bomber commanders were not really interested in any purely military or economic targets, which was just as well, for they knew very little about Dresden; the RAF even lacked proper maps of the city. What they were looking for was a big built up area which they could burn, and that Dresden possessed in full measure""""McKee (1983), p.63.

According to historian Sonke Neitzel, """"it is difficult to find any evidence in German documents that the destruction of Dresden had any consequences worth mentioning on the Eastern Front. The industrial plants of Dresden played no significant role in Germany industry at this stage in the war""""Addison (2006) Chapter """"The City under Attack"""" by Sonke Neitzel p.76 Wing Commander H. R. Allen said, """"The final phase of Bomber Command's operations was far and away the worst. Traditional British chivalry and the use of minimum force in war was to become a mockery and the outrages perpetrated by the bombers will be remembered a thousand years hence""""McKee (1983), p. 315. Quotes H. R. Allen (1972) The Legacy of Lord Trenchard

In the north of Dresden there were remarkable military facilities which were not hit by the bombings. Today they are still there, used as officer education buildings for the German Bundeswehr and hosting Germany's military-historic museum (from stone-age to modern times).

Batvette, the above comments come from WP:RS that are significantly more NPOV than the USAF's Air Force Historical Studies Office.
Regardless, claiming that US culpability for its involvement in the Dresden firebombing was mitigated because it focused its bombing on the """"Marshalling Yards"""" is a bit like the arsonist claiming that she's innocent of murder because she only intended to set fire to the relatively-u",0,0,0,0,0,0

The Objectivity of this Discussion is doubtful (non-existent)

(1) As indicated earlier, the section on Marxist leaders’ views is misleading:

(a) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on Trotsky, creating the misleading impression that other prominent Marxists (Marx, Engels, Lenin) did not advocate and/or practiced terrorism;

(b) it lays unwarranted and excessive emphasis on the theoretical “rejection of individual terrorism”, creating the misleading impression that this is the main (only) Marxist position on terrorism. 

(2) The discussion is not being properly monitored:

(a) no discernible attempt is being made to establish and maintain an acceptable degree of objectivity;

(b) important and relevant scholarly works such as the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism are being ignored or illicitly excluded from the discussion;

(c) though the only logical way to remedy the blatant imbalance in the above section is to include quotes by/on other leaders who are known to have endorsed and practiced terrorism all attempts to do so have been systematically blocked with impunity by the apologists for Marxist terrorism who have done their best to sabotage and wreck both the article and the discussion.

(3) Among the tactics deployed by the apologist wreckers and saboteurs the following may be identified as representative examples:

(a) it is claimed that Marx and Engels did not advocate terrorism despite the fact that scholarly works like the International Encyclopedia of Terrorism show that they did, and Marx himself was known as “The Red Terror Doctor”;

(b) it is claimed that Marx and Engels were not involved in terrorist activities despite the fact that numerous sources from The Neue Rheinische Zeitung to Isaiah Berlin and Francis Wheen state otherwise;

(c) it is claimed that Lenin does not refer to terror in The Proletarian Revolution and the Renegade K. Kautsky and other works/statements despite the fact that Robert Service, IET, and other scholarly and reliable sources state that he does;

(d) it is claimed that the Russian word ‘’strakh’’ does not mean “terror” when:

i. the Oxford Russian Dictionary says that it does;

ii. it is evident from the context that this is the case;

iii. any educated Russian speaker can confirm that strakh may mean “terror” depending on the context;

(e) it is claimed that Marxism is “scientific” when in fact:

i. Marx was not a scientist;

ii. Marx’s background was philosophy and law, not science;

iii. Marxism is not recognized as a science by the academic world;

iv. virtually every one of Marx’s predictions turned out to be wrong, as became increasingly apparent during his lifetime and incontrovertibly so after his death (R. Pipes, Communism: A Brief History, 2001, p. 15) from which it follows that Marxism does not qualify as a scientific system by any accepted standards;

v. the evidence indicates that Marxism is closer to a religious sect than to science proper;

(f) apologist literature is being quoted in a fraudulent attempt to whitewash Marxist terrorism, in effect turning the discussion into an advertisement for terrorism;

(g) it is claimed that Marxist terrorism is not rooted in the Marxist theory of class struggle even though there are numerous sources showing that it is (please note that it is immaterial whether terrorism had already been justified in terms of a theory of class prior to Marx, the point being that it was advocated/practiced on the basis of Marxist class-struggle theories BY MARXISTS):

“Karl Marx felt that terror was a necessary part of a revolutionary strategy” (Peter Galvert, “Theories of Terror in Urban Insurrections”, IET, p. 138);

“Revolutionary terrorism has its roots in a political ideology, from the Marxist-Leninist thinking of the Left, to the fascists found on the Right” (Noemi Gal-Or, """"Revolutionary Terrorism"""", IET, p. 203);

“… perhaps the most important key to Stalin’s motivation lies in the realm of ideology. The leitmotif of Soviet communist ideology in the 1920s and 1930s was class struggle – the inbuilt antagonism between mutually incompatible economic interest groups” (Geoffrey Robert, Stalins Wars, 2006, pp. 17-18);

this fact is supported not only by reliable academic sources, but by elementary logic: 

“In 1907 Mehring published in the magazine ‘’Neue Zeit (Vol. XXV 2, p. 164) extracts from a letter by Marx to Weydemeyer dated March 5, 1852. In this letter, among other things, is the following noteworthy observation: … class struggle necessarily leads to the dictatorship of the proletariat …”",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Missing system? 

This page from the Organization of American States has a table about midway through it. In the section Mexico is has several different hurricanes listed. Between Janet and Tara there is a gap that appears to indicate an unnamed hurricane. The table attributes 960 casualties to this mysterious unnamed tropical cyclone. It also indicates that it took place in October, 1960. The problem is, this mysterious system is not in the best track. The last named storm in the Atlantic was in September. In the Pacific, the only October systems were Hyacinth and perhaps the deleted Gwen. And yet a search through the hurricane archive for """"Storm Gwen"""", """"Hurricane Gwen"""", """"Storm Hyacinth"""", and """"Hurricane Hyacinth"""" reveals only a single hit from the wrong year. How does someone miss a tropical cyclone killing nearly 1000 people? Unless it was a tropical depression that did that, something does not add up here.  | Talk to Madeline """,0,0,0,0,0,0

As I recall, the """"classic 6"""" teams were in a league that operated like a country club. They nearly got caught napping, but they headed off the second-major-league threat by expanding... which of course brought in a bunch of money to the old guard from the entrance fees. Also, they aligned the new teams in a separate division, which essentially made the Stanley Cup finals an exhibition series for the winners of the """"classic 6"""" playoff rounds. Further evolution of the league evened out a lot of that stuff, of course, but there's some intrigue connected with their initial expansion. I noticed there were many references to """"Norris House League"""" in Google, so it's not like this is unknown.

11. Washington, D.C.

I think these are all the places that have any claim of being a capital of the United States.  Of these, New York City and Philadelphia have the strongest claims of being the first capital.  One question to answer is what constitutes being the first capital.  Do we start the clock at the signing of the Declaration of Independence, the Article of Confederation, or the Constitution.  I think that the Constitution would be the key event because before that, America was really a group of independent colonies rather than a nation.

Also, I believe that New York City did not have the physical infrastructure (buildings, etc.) in place to be an actual capital for the newly formed government.  I think it acted more as a temporary meeting place.  Philadelphia did have a lot of infrastructure for the federal government because it was trying to woe the government into making Philly the permanent capital.

In my opinion, Philly should be considered the first capital of the U.S. because it had actual capital buildings that were used by the government after the signing of the Constitution.  The fact that Philly was also used as the first capital of the colonies is not relevent in my opinion.

However, I am not a historian or an expert in early American history, so I don't want to update the article myself.  Also, from my research, there seems to be a lot of contention about which city is the first capital.  Would a historian or professor of history please comment on this issue and update the page.

Robert Deegan 
General Liability Claims Section
Los Angeles Unified School District
333 S Beaudry Ave  28th Floor 
Los Angeles CA 90017  

Dear Mr. Deegan:

This letter shall constitute a claim pursuant to the California Tort Claims Act, Section 910 et seq of the California Government Code.

My address information in compliance with Section 910(a) and (b) is set forth above.

Per Section 910(c), (d) and (e), the date of occurrence was October 5, 2007.  I was assaulted and battered by students T and I and possibly other students at Markham Middle School, 145 W 108th Street, Los Angeles.  The Police Report is DR#071828895.

LAUSD personnel, specifically, Steven Thomas Rooney, aided and abetted violations of the Ralph and Bane Civil Rights Acts, Sections 51.7, 52 and 52.1 of the California Civil Code and Sections 242, 245, and 422.6 of the California Penal Code, by failing and refusing to report the matter to police authorities.  LAUSD violated my rights under Article I, Section One of the California Constitution to safety and my specific right to safety on a school campus under Article I, Section 28 of the California Constitution.  I have suffered physical damages and extreme emotional trauma as a result.

David Brewer and other personnel knew or should have known based upon my complaints and upon past known misconduct by Rooney that Rooney was unfit as a supervisory employee of LAUSD.  LAUSD therefore negligently hired, trained, assigned, supervised and retained Rooney and ignored my complaints about his misconduct.

LAUSD’s conduct towards me is motivated by benign neglect of complaints of discrimination, retaliation, and harassment by Latino employees, as exemplified in past incidents by Superintendent Brewer and the General Counsel’s office failing to properly investigate and take appropriate action when complaints were levelled against anti-Hispanic ethnocentric misconduct against an attorney employed by the Office of the General Counsel, and other incidents.

Pursuant to Section 910(f) this claim is for damages within the jurisdiction of the unlimited division of the Los Angeles Superior Court.

Respectfully Submitted,

I cling to facts and truth. Many of your so-called reliable sources couldn't even tell you what Minor Threat and Black Flag sounded like let alone these bands. People that know what they're talking about usually see it as a waste of time to deal with idiots that don't, or that won't listen to the truth because it ruins their """"cool"""" mainstream image of what they've been spoon-fed to believe about emo. Greenwald isn't any better of a source. He's just someone that wrote a bad book. Big deal. Don't you even understand why it'd be hard to get old articles on here? No internet existed. Bands broke up fast. Records are out of print. The record labels closed. No talking heads in the media knew what the hell emo was in the early 90's. Common sense. And this article doesn't even really talk about what makes emo emo, and I know someone like you couldn't do that either. Instead of talking about what kind of music or vocals are used, time is wasted on lyrical content. Those are words. Lyrics do not define music genres. Anyone can write a song about any topic they want. The point of the genre is to describe the actual music involved and how it's played. Where's the fact that bands very rarely used clean, melodic singing vocals early on? It was either a yelling/screaming type vocal from hardcore, or they would actually just talk in the songs like how bands like Indian Summer and Moonraker did. Genre is how you play, not what you say. That concept is lost here, along with many others.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm glad you responded.  I was not looking for an apology.  I realize the second part of the comment wasn't directed at me.  The first part seemed to be putting me in my place  when you could have written a note on my talk page.  Now that you've explained your position, I understand.  If you find any others that I've uploaded, it's not necessary to post anything on my talk page.  I understand what you're saying, although I disagree with one part of it regarding film publicity photos, which were mass-distributed, sometimes without registering for copyright.  We don't know which are free and which are not, so it's not something that can be pursued, and I wouldn't try to claim any specific image falls into that group.     I still see problems with the Blondie image.   For one, it doesn't show anything vital that the article couldn't do without.  They're all living people, one of whom isn't even notable enough for a Wikipedia article, and they're not doing anything.   It only shows what they look like.   If it was a significant moment and if the photo showed them doing something that could not be adequately described in prose,  I could understand.  Regardless of what brought them together, the photo itself gives nothing except to show what they look like.   Given the degree of thought you've given to the actress photos, I don't understand why you accept a fair rationale saying """"they cannot be brought together because they live in three separate areas of the U.S."""" which is a false statement, contradicted by common sense - there are numerous ways they could be brought together - and by the very existence of the photo.  I'd accept a rationale that justified its use, but not that.  Still, you said you may even nominate it for deletion someday, but that it's not a priority, so you're obviously not completely convinced.  Anyway, I understand your viewpoint on the actress photos, so thank you for taking the time to convey your thoughts.  Regards.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Other Information
Shawn won good remarks from the judges, but not on all episodes of the Campus SuperStar compeitition, especially on the last episode, when the Grand Finals were held, because Shawn's performance was below par.

“I began singing from the time I was in Primary 4… after I watched Daphne Khoo on TV,” said Shawn once, “My mum forced me to sing every day from 8 to 10pm for the past one week, and told me how I can improve my singing.""""

Shawn's mother reportedly spent S$100,000 voting for Shawn in the Campus SuperStar compeitition.

Other Information
Shawn won good remarks from the judges, but not on all episodes of the Campus SuperStar compeitition, especially on the last episode, when the Grand Finals were held, because Shawn's performance was below par.

“I began singing from the time I was in Primary 4… after I watched Daphne Khoo on TV,” said Shawn once, “My mum forced me to sing every day from 8 to 10pm for the past one week, and told me how I can improve my singing.""""

Shawn's mother reportedly spent S$100,000 voting for Shawn in the Campus SuperStar compeitition.

Between when I left the request and when you replied here you've made 6 edits to 3 articles, including 3 edits to The Real Housewives of Orange County. It does not matter that the table """"has been there the longest"""". If it doesn't comply with our policies and guidelines it needs to be fixed, not left in a non-compliant format. I am clearly not the only one complaining about the table. Numerous editors have attempted to change this and similar tables at various articles and you've reverted them without explanation. That's edit-warring, which can result in you being blocked from editing. There's even a Request for Comment open at WT:TV. However, even if I was the only one complaining, that's irrelevant. It just happens that I noticed the lack of compliance. Removing bolding from the table is simply not enough; the table needs to fully comply, which means incorporating row and column scopes, plainrowheaders, and fixing capitalisation problems as a minimum. There are numerous errors in the table that should also be fixed. You're obvioulsy aware of the existence of errors as you have fixed some yourself. As for being """"easier to understand, easier to read, catches the eye better"""", the two tables are almost visually identical, so those are not valid reasons. The only visual differences are the capitalisation and column width fixes and better compliance with MOS:COLOR. From an editorial standpoint, the compliant table is much easier to read and update.

7d162ae660e549c2,"oh the classic SM/DF response. That was only one of a range of clumsy stupid errors added into the article. For example, we put the first title held by a monarch first. James was James VI of Scotland long before he became James I of England. So everyone agreed that that was the order they should be in. But in typical SM/DF style it was decided, 'screw everyone else's agreement, I am going to unilaterally change it. (Like Adam tried to screw up naming conventions, and even when voted down still ignored the decision and did it Adam's way, leaving everyone else to rename articles and clear up the mess by returning things to the agreed formula. 

Second, there was a long long long debate about when to describe a modern monarch as British. It was agreed to apply it to after 1707. But Adam decided to ignore the long debate and do it his way, his way on the naming of election pages (who cares if everyone else uses a totally different system and votes down his suggestion!), his way on referring to peers, his way on using the word British, on how to describe James VI/I, his way now on the History of the Soviet Union, his way on how names on a list should appear (the different way to everyone else's, he unilaterally changing lists to suit what he wanted, even when everyone else screamed 'what the hell are you doing'.  Other people put a lot of work into getting a consensus. Adam ignores the consensus and does it the way he wants. And gets miffed when people end up undoing his garbled stuff and return things to the agreed way.

Yes there has been an improvement, cp. DF was actually nice to work with for about 4 days, then suddenly became an ogre on idolatory and various other pages. The immediate reaction was 'oh God, here we go again'. Even Mav let out a sigh about DF's behaviour, and Mav doesn't normally do that. Most of us are fed up trying to explain to SM/DF where they are wrong, only to be ignored and blatently untrue rubbish dumped into articles. So we aren't been called rascists and nazis, big deal! SM/DF's behaviour is still way of the mark. It is as if Adam goes onto wiki with the basic approach of 'now where can I cause grief today?'.

 Blatant Racist editing 

Hi Mentifisto

You kindly acted on a report just now of vandalism on Sol Campbell [diff] by  User talk:86.153.188.51. I thought such blatant racist editing would receive an immediate block as per 
Wikipedia:No personal attacks rather than just a 1st level warning. Please can you advise how I should act in future, many thanks  
Well, in that case the edit had been made some time prior and the latest was not clear vandalism so the IP may have possibly be reassigned but generally I think it's best to give them a  warning so as to prepare them.  fisto 
Hi Mentifisto, Thanks for your feedback and I am truely sorry to trouble you again but I am left even more confused and need to know where to refer to to get an understanding of the line is drawn on racism on Wikipedia. The IP used the term stupid n*****r (in caps) at 20:38 on 16th May. This to me is just as bad as it gets. I reported this to WP:AIV at 21:19 and you applied the warning at 21:20. I can only assume you looked at the later edit to Didier Zokora which was not obviously that offensive to me at least. Thanks   
I am also a little confused. I agree that there is a fine line in dealing with personal attacks. I simply would like this line pointed out so that we will know how to deal with it in the future. Thanks,   
Well, I think it's down to individual discretion; blocks are preventive, so if the IP is unlikely to commit another similar edit in the next ten minutes or so it'd be somewhat redundant. Personally I'd give them the above immediate final warning so they know the consequences of their actions.  [[User talk:Mentifisto|",0,0,0,0,0,0

Bradford City Hall
Hi.  Thanks for your question.  I'm ashamed to say I've never been to Bradford City Hall, even though I wrote the article on it.  I'd love to go.  I did speak to a local journo who said that it was OK to take photos in there, though.  (Some town halls are a bit weird about photos; no-one has told them about panoramafreiheit.)  Anyway, what I could do for you is to phone Bradford Council tomorrow and if I'm lucky I'll get some bored employee who would just love to leave their desk and look at the windows.  People never look at anything, and you can bet your life someone is working beneath your window day in, day out, and hasn't noticed it.  If I forget, keep reminding me until I do it.  It would be a fun job to go and photograph it.  I need to do a winter photo of Bradford Industrial Museum, anyway - you can't see the jolly thing for trees in summer.  
 Update: I rang Bradford City Hall, and they had not heard of any such memorial window.  Someone kindly investigated for me, and they rang back today and said that it's a mistake, and there is no architectural feature such as a memorial window dedicated to this lady.  There is a movable installation within the building, incorporating a display dedicated to her and to other local heroes.  I'm told that this is in a public place and that I can visit it.  I shall photograph that for you when I can - hopefully during the next couple of weeks - but I'm sorry there is no window to photograph. I guess that there is a slight possibility that there may be a memorial window in a church somewhere, and that could explain the error, but I don't know how to investigate that.  
 Thanks for your reply.  I've just heard that I may be able to visit the City Hall tomorrow.  I'll see what I can do.  
 Update: Just letting you know that because Coronation Street is filming in the building for the next two weeks, it will not be permissible for me to get into the building to see the display which includes B.J. Harrison. The staff have tried to fix it for me today, but cannot.  I'll try to do it in two or three weeks' time, though.  If I appear to be delaying or forgetting, please kindly give me a reminder.  Thanks.

 Tudeley and treacle 

Hi there.

The problem with the treacle mine entry is that although it is amusing it does not add much to the general content of the page.

If you were to expand the Tudeley article to include a lot more information about the place, and then add your (quite amusing) treacle mine ref for good measure I would have no problem.

But when the article is just 120-odd words in length, to devote 10% of them to treacle mines seems disproportionate to me.

Hiya,

No, I didn't..what a time to be on holiday and not see the 'frickin' article on BBC!  Thankfully they've posted the piece on the web.  As far as I know, they think, with some justification, that it's a D017, but there doesn't appear to be a definite identification of it being THE D017 in my article, although the circumstantial evidence seems strong. Being local, I'm hoping to talk to the guys featured and see if I can find out some specifics. I'll pass on what I can but as this would constitute original research, I guess I can only point interested readers to other external content like the BBC Kent page -( Bummer!

Well, not that i don't appreciate what you said, but even so, allow me to reply. 

Today there were the funerals of Enzo Biagi, a freeman as few remains in a world more and more without any respect for freedom (seen as a 'threat for the established order'). The oil price is flying to 100$ and this should led to think more seriously to our absurd world. But let's go:

1-there is someone that is costantly pointed at the 'words' while others are pointed on 'facts'. Since you call my comment 'above' as non-polite, obviously you miss why i could be not friendly with someone that not miss a time to complain in Arbcom every time we discuss in any sense. This is 'polite' and wikilove for you? To me it not looks so. Since i am a volonteer here, not payed (as all the collaborators as well), you cannot pretent i act like all the conformists here have established, and obey to Bzuk or BillCJ every time saying 'yes master, yes master, like you want master'. And surely i wouldn't take EH as 'bright example'. Sorry, the manner in which they acted not displays any reasonable friendly-acting. So it's hard pretend to me to be so kind with gentlemen that not even bothers to explain why they does this and that revert.

2-Another thing that show dramatically well some things: 

Take for instance, the first paragraph after the header """"Technical description""""...the paragraph ends with the sentence """"the only real all-around fighter that served in AMI, but this was not without limitation in every task."""" That's a very subjective statement, and, since it's making a judgement, it really needs a citation so that the reader can understand what the source of that statement is. As it stands right now, however, because it is not cited, it merely looks like opinion on your part, which would be right to remove/revert.

All the G.91R page explains continuosly why this plane was 'limited' and 'mainly successful as recce'. I cannot understand how this thing, considering all the datas and stuff given, can be 'questioned'. Rather than criticize me just try to get a look about the JAS-39 Gripen. 

Basically, questioning this fact shows apalling comprension for all the article, because it's a statement well placed inside the meaning of this work.

3-Washing your hands and not bother about to collaborate with me is not surely a 'nice' manner to do. Strangely enough, this is 'justified', rather than be a guilth. So, basically, every thing i do or not do is wrong, while every thing you do or not do is right. With these bases, expecting a costructive dialogue is just funny. You have been 'offensed' by the vanification of F-104S adjustements (because i after done some more contr.). This is the only thing you did in over a month of 'collaboration'. Too easy, my dear, to self justify all times like you. Easy not bothering to collaborate, while the guilth is mine that already lost my time to contribue gratis to this ency.

4-My contributions should be alway quoted here and that. But being serious, there are a lot of pages without any or almost any references. I dont' understand why i should be whipped to post 500 kb. The issue about F-86 data touched the buttom of the sea and dig it too. I cannot cope with someone that not even read online sources with absurd reasons.

5-The continuos accuses, diffamations and so on about me are not liked either. Perhaps the problem is that Wikipedia takes herself too seriously in the last times? Perhaps that be called 'traitor' or 'harmer' is not friendly? Obviously you rate these accusation as 'righful critics'. But not i.

I remember very well that you accused me without any proof to make copyviols, even with funny interpretations of Goebel PD text (that i stated as not mine, the only time i used other texts in all the MB written for the sake of Wiki). I wouldn't have a judge like you in the real world, believe me.

6-The fantastic wikioz world, 'tooooo perfect' to be 'questioned'. But to me and some others, this looks not exactly true. There are a lot of burocrats, hipocrites and trolls, or simply there are a lot of guys that basically fears the others and are ready to 'defend the Revolution' with zealot fanatism. Questioning even the basical celebral activity and even the basical freedom of spreech, questioning even the simply syllogism. 

All this is due because, as always in these cases, from French revolution today there are always many 'revolutionary guards' ready to show their 'loyalty' to the 'cause'. So wikipedia prefers executes guys 'out of the chor' instead to admit to have some 'contradictions'. This is the usual manner to act. And i have no love to who call me 'wiki.harmer' just because i show that i 'know' my stuff, not only 'have read it somewhere'. This is why Goebel and many others keeps away from",0,0,0,0,0,0

I was reading this article and I noticed that one possible reason for celibacy is missing. It is the reason I have chosen to become a celibate: I have a mental disorder that many people are trying to cure (I won't mention which one because it's not relevant in this context), and I have become a celibate so that I cannot have children and therefore cannot contribute to the continuation of this mental disorder's gene.

What I'm saying is, do enough people become celibates for the reason that they cannot reproduce and therefore not give their unborn children undesirable genetic qualities (like defects, mental disorders, ect.)? If so, would this be worth putting on this article?",0,0,0,0,0,0

I very much enjoy and appreciate Wikipedia but it's nothing more than something I occasionally pop-in to edit or create an article occasionally.

I never pursued the matter beyond that, nor did I file a complaint regarding the emails, nor did I even remember it occurred until I logged back on after a few months away to edit an article I'd previously written and found your many messages to me.

As far as I know, it is your interest in pursuing this I am accommodating and the characterization of a """"song and dance"""" is not one I feel is appropriate to describe my total ambivalence to your inquiry (please understand - the preceding is not intended to be trite, I simply want to unambiguously communicate that the entire matter is one of no interest to me, so as to assuage any concerns of a """"song and dance""""). 
 I would like to personally apologize to you for not responding to your interrogatories """"forthwith."""" I can only give you my personal assurance that I did not leave Wikipedia for two months as part of a scheme to evade your investigation. I know you've said you're incredulous to that notion, but I will offer you this personal assurance anyway. 
 Kindly accept this post in the spirit in which it was intended - as a frank and direct response to concerns you are expressing - and not as a slight in any way. If I have failed to communicate something here with appropriate finesse, understand it is only because of serious IRL issues I currently face that limit the time I can commit to pursuing online intrigue, and absolutely not because I am trying to scandalize you. 
If there is anything else I can help you with, please do not hesitate to let me know, however, in interests of wrapping this up in a succinct manner, I would like to suggest we terminate this back-and-forth and allow ArbCom to do whatever it is their role in this is supposed to be. Best -

You quickly forget that I am objecting to the MISINTERPRETATION of a 'rule', and the MISAPPLICATION of a 'rule'.   (or, do you not concede that, hypothetically, a VALID, proper rule can be MISINTERPRETED and/or MISAPPLIED?).  Merely citing the RULE is pointless, when the problem is the misinterpretation or misapplication of the rule!
 Further, Dodo violated WP rules, by not allowing a consensus of the group to develop.  He also misapplied a rule, claiming that something I said must be 'verifiable'.  But what does it mean, to be 'verified'?  Dodo implied that what I said must be verifiably, scientifically TRUE.  I claim, quite to the contrary, that since the article involved is 'Jim Bell' (subject, ME), that the only 'verifiability' issue is this:  Did 'James Dalton Bell' ACTUALLY make these claims.  (Or, conversely and hypothetically, 'is someone else forging his identity?, etc.)   For example, there was no need to RUSH and delete my posts.  Rather, somebody (preferably, one familiar with LOGIC) could have said, """"Bell, how do we know that 'you', 'jimdbell@q.com', is in fact the 'jim bell' (James Dalton Bell) who is the subject of the 'Jim Bell' WP article?  We need to be able to VERIFY the fact that 'jim bell' actually said/did this."""" (To ensure that 'jim bell' is not being libelled by a stealth forgery.)
In response, I would have immediately said, """"Good question!""""  And I could have promptly proceeded to do whatever was necessary to establish this fact.  Perhaps I could also have donated a recent (current!) photograph to the article, which (of course) could be compared with other published (even if not public domain) photographs which are available on the web.   
But as John Belushi was so fond of saying, 'BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO!'  Rather than HELP a 'newbie' (to WP), AND wait for a consensus, and actually help VERIFY that 'jimdbell@q.com' is actually, 'jim bell', Dodo decided to be an ass and repeatedly delete my edits.  And, he deleted ALL my edits, not merely some portion which (allegedly) was not 'verifiable'.  I will give an example, to the contrary:  I also posted a claim that I accused the Feds of forgery in a criminal appeal case, 99-30210.  In fact, in June 2003 I wrote a lawsuit (195 pages) which has (I believe) LONG been posted on the Web.  (Probably Cryptome/JYA).  It (as I recall) makes exactly this accusation.  So, if Dodo had actually acted INTELLIGENTLY, he would have edited my edit to cite my lawsuit, which has been posted for perhaps 5+ years.  (Or, he would have said to me, """"Bell, you need to show a cite of your lawsuit..."""").  THAT would have been productive, useful, and helpful.  (As opposed to being hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.)   So, why didn't Dodo do THAT?!?   The answer is quite simple:  Dodo is hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.  He's a 'control freak'.  (Apparently, WP attracts 'control freaks'.)  Rather than being assisting, supportive, and helpful, Dodo wants to slap around newbies who upset his apple cart.

Hi! Great if you improve the English language Kvarstad artcicle with material from the Swedish version. I have been aware of the Swedish article for quite a while, and notice that you did a good job in translating/adapting this article into Norwegian. I only noticed one obvious error in the numbers, that is the sentence(s) """"Lägren hade då totalt 382 besättningsmedlemmar från kvarstadsbåtarna"""" and """"Leiren hadde da totalt 382 besetningsmedlemmer fra kvarstadbåtene"""", where the number 382 conflicts with other numbers given. It is correct that the cited source gives this number, but it has to be either a misprint or meant to include more.

Speedy deletion of Emma morton-smith
 A tag has been placed on Emma morton-smith requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time.

Rascals became superstars with rockstar status. Listening to their

on time. They were the first editors I remember playing with speed
(slowing down voices/phrases) They seemed to be on everything from
radio(ktu,kiss fm and hot 103.5 and hot 97.1) club music to hip hop
(king kut; Run Dmc King of Rock) and pop. They produced many hits in
the club/freestyle genre; appeared on movie soundtracks
(disorderlies) and appeared on television (the music show second
generation with andy panda and tony moran) produced a hip hop
platinum album (the fat boys) became succesful artists (bach to the
future; arabian nights) and world reknowned remixers. Out of the
pack (omar santana; carlos berrios, chep nunez, etc...) these guys
did it all. Albert Cabrera appeared on Ktu solo and what he
accomplished with a pause button was nothing short of amazing. I'm
still in shock at some of the things I heard done; this coupled with
the ability to do megamix medleys seperated him from the bunch; when
he paired with tony moran things got crazier. The remixes they did
with Little Louie Vega on vinyl (information society's running)and
the exclusive mixes (called hotmixes specially made for bill lee the
on air personality who requested they do special versions)were
incredible; two of them appeared on cutting remixes; dont' break my
heart and let me be the one. The radio only version of Jody watley's 
I'm lookin for a new love was insane!!!!!!!! So was the
cover girls show me and Noel's silent morning; these were radio only
remixes that never appeared on vinyl. I only heard Little Louie Vega
play them when he rocked hearthrob nightclub in nyc. If anyone has
access to them; I wish they'd post them up. These were definitley
staples in the art of multi editing and remixing. Eternal props
and much respect to The ultimate duo The Latin Rascals!!!!!!

I would recommend trying to limit your list to some
(likely) forgotten names in strictly the tape cutting trade,
or very prominently focussing on cutting up masters,
because the ones we know, like Cabrera, Berrios etc.
well, everyone can mention those...

Also, not all DJ's do impressive cutting.
If we're gonna mention each and every person
who has cut tape once, where do you draw the line?

Remarkable is that this 12 inch does not even credit them

Yes, but it might have been 1982 when Jellybean and Baker
tried out their first versions of 'Confusion' in the Funhouse club.
It usually took quite some time back then, for the world to hear
those tracks, or have them available as a release on vinyl.

Also interesting;

Okay, I disagree with this just as strongly as I disagree with attempts to say he wasn't Jewish.  Firstly, Marx didn't kill anybody, nor did his ideology.  A bunch of people claiming to be inspired by his ideas killed millions of people.  And given that the German people managed to produce some unquestionably German people who unquestionably actually did murder millions of people, I'm not going to weep for the fact that the Germans are also saddled with responsibility for one of the greatest political philosophers of the nineteenth century.  Beyond that, Marx was born and grew up in Germany with a very limited connection to his Jewish ancestry.  His primary language was German, and this is the language in which he wrote most of his works.  Although he spent most of his later life in England, I've never really heard that he didn't always consider himself to be a German - I'd think, in fact, that living in England would have accentuated that.  While I do think that his Jewish background is important, and make it perfectly reasonable to describe him as a Jew, his German background was substantially more important than his Jewish one.  His own works emerged out of post-Hegelian debates within the German philosophical community, and his greatest influence throughout his life (and for several decades afterwards) was in Germany, where Marxists were far more dominant within the socialist community than they were in most other parts of Europe (Britain, France, and Russia, in particular, had their own, non-Marxist, socialist traditions that were not assimilated into Marxism for a long time, if ever).

If camperdown had arranged to pass just behind victoria it should have worked. What we need is someone experienced with fleet handling who could give a view on whether it would work.  I think what actually happened to the other ships after the collision shows it would have been possible for the two columns to turn inwards very tight without colliding or crossing, but only by taking extreme measures (ie turning by reversing one screw). Victoria seems to have signalled she was doing a tight turn without engines (there were signaling devices to indicate if engines were reversed). Markham seems to have started off  with a textbook standard turn and then panicked too late, trying to turn faster. I thinkat the time the suggestion that the lines might have crossed was dismissed, but then, would a court-martial made up of the people involved have come to the conclusion that there was a simple workable solution which would have avoided the sinking. What I like most about the scissors is its elegance, it is so in keeping with Tryons style.

1) """"It is simply a fact that many critics of Sarfatti are very negative about his theories and speculations.""""

False. You have not given even ONE valid example of that. I doubt you would be able to understand what the physics is about anyway.
You cannot produce even ONE objective valid refutation of any of my physics ideas by anyone. CH saying """"it's nonsense"""" is not objective. It's not valid. It is not rationally argued. No reasons are given. Also I retracted my FTL Communication Idea 15 years ago. Furthermore, making a mistake in physics does not make one into a crackpot! Also, you have suppressed the fact that I predicted the SUPERSOLID decades before it was discovered and before Tony Leggett, who gets the credit published his paper. George Chapline and David Finkelstein confirm that in writing and you have consistently deleted that important factual information from the article. That is hardly fair is it?

2) """"It is also a fact that Usenet is not the usual venue for publishing even highly unconventional ideas in physics.""""

Sez who? That is exactly what Usenet SHOULD be for! INSTANT WORLD WIDE COMMUNICATION OF IMPORTANT IDEAS NOT THE CRAP THAT MOST IDIOTS PUT ON IT. Peer review is a joke in physics today. Everyone in the field knows it. The free market place of ideas is supposed to be the Wiki idea, or am I wrong? Mainstream journals DO NOT PUBLISH UNCONVENTIONAL IDEAS! What planet are you on?

3) Sarfatti has been considered negatively by many since his involvment with paraphysics dating back to ths 1970s, long before the existince of Usenet, for which I have proveided reputable sources (and can provide more). 

STOP RIGHT THERE! You just committed a HATE CRIME! Are you ABOVE THE LAW? So working on paranormal stuff automatically makes one a crackpot? Is that your position? That's like saying it's OK to lynch niggers because they are less than human. Same idea. Think about it. Sarfatti thinking outside the box means he is not entitled to the same respect as someone taking the safe boring path through life. Who are your reputable sources? Show them. Martin Gardner? Show where his exact text justifies your false extrapolation. Also, I do not in 2005 hold to the same ideas I did in 1975! Why focus on 1975 and exclude 2005? 

4) It is also a fact that were it not for his provocative statements and the largely negative reaction to them, Sarfatti would not be in any way notable.

False. I would be notable for several ideas in physics. The quotations by David Finkelstein, Lenny Susskind, George Chapline and Tony Smith prove that. It's OK to say """"negative reaction"""", but it's not OK to LYNCH ME and DEFAME ME with putting """"crank"""" and """"crackpot"""" on a very scant article in such a way that that is the KEY MESSAGE the casual reader will go away from. Now ANY LAWYER will tell you you are treading on shaky ground if you do that and cannot prove your case should it ever go to court. This is NOT a threat. I am on several TV shows and I am in Paramount Pictures Star Trek. That does not make me notable. I am cited in several popular books. That also makes me notable. For example, Herbert Gold's book Bohemia, not to mention The Dancing Wu Li Master that I ghost wrote most of  for Gary Zukavand that sold a jillion copies and is still selling after 25 years. My original Space-Time and Beyond sold fairly well also. So look David E. Siegel from Two Independence Way Suite 100, Princeton NJ 08540, your research on me is pure shlock. It's fragmentary and it gives a completely distorted image of who I really am and what I really think and WHY I AM NOTABLE!

5)"""" Now, none of that means that his critics are correct. It is true that many well-known people are strogly attacked, and it is also true that many eventually widely acccepted scientific ideas are considered absurd and crankish early in their history.  (Continental drift comes to mind and there are many other examples.) It is possible (although I belive unlikely) that Sarfatti's ideas will be similarly respected in the future. (Of course that fact that many respected theories were once thought crankish does not alter the fact that most ideas thought crankish are always so regarded  the crank thory that proves correct is a rare beast.)""""

OK, THAT'S ENOUGH you SOB! I have several MAINSTREAM PAPERS of importance that are recognized. Details were systematically vandalized from the article. Prediction of the SUPERSOLID is a KEY ONE. That ALONE makes me NOTABLE as a physicist. You DEFAME ME here and you maliciously SUPPRESS the facts. You owe me a BIG PUBLIC APOLOGY! So what you SYSOP geeks are above the law here? You can defame me, but I can't defend myself? This is still American not the Soviet Gulag!

1. Civility - I made one comment on a users talk page in a semi-sandbox section that they made regarding dog meat, that I thought it was inhumane and that some of the edits are based on nationalistic motives. Yes this was a personal comment, but it was certainly not racist nor directed at anyone in particular. If you blocked every who ever made a comment conveying their personal opinion on a users talk page, wikipedia would have about 3 editors left.

Also I posted """"LOL that made me laugh"""" on another users page, I really don't see any problem with that.

2. Harassment/Stalking - as I outlined in my unblock request, I have checked the edits of other editors and reverted when I saw the need. These are not random editors, these are editors who have brought themselves to my attention with their patterns of what I consider to be flawed edits. This is how wikipedia works, you make a dodgy edit, people revert you, check your edit history and see what other dodgy edits you have made, taking action when needed.

In short, I see no reason whatsoever for me deserving a one week block for a personal comment, a LOL and checking the edits of users who got my attention by their editing patterns.

So even if you do not view the CDs released on Kidatrium and Mushroomcloud Records as """"Albums"""", the fact still remains that they (his band Sin Star) has been on 2 national tours. The remarks you made about the picture on the wall at school is churlish btw, VCU's center for the arts is very reputable for it's art galleries if you read the page on them here at wikipedia you'd know. Those tidibits you took cheap shots at were simply part of the biography, not claims to notability. The Music and the Web Design Company should be the deciding factors, and they DO meet the rules... So please reconsider. By all means message me back if you wish to discuss this.

Look the point summarized is I am willing to work with you guys on why these were deleted but until now noone has given us any feedback and has even lied about stuff trying to get it deleted. All 3 of them meet the sufficient amount of requirements for WP:MUSIC, the guidelines in WP:Criteria_for_inclusion_of_biographies, Wikipedia:Importance, Wikipedia:Notability (the fact that suicide girls, gidget gein, and marilyn manson are involved and can be verified in those links should proove that) , Wikipedia:Fame_and_importance mainly the part stating """"There is clear proof that a reasonable number of people are or were concurrently interested in the subject (eg. it is at least well-known in a community)"""" If you can't tell the community of Myspace.com and Livejournal.com alone are enough to meet this criterea you are blind. If you do google searches, go to forums and search their names, or visit internet archives you can find un-disputable information on the band from reputable sources, first hand accounts that are years older than these discussions, and intangible archives kept by internet archives. IF you want more detail read my above rant, your right I do sound mad about this, because I can't see how you can say they do not meet criterea or that this is a vanity page. Please accept my apologies for anything you have taken to be rude and please re-consider changing your vote. What Harm could it do ? BTW I am not trying to bully anyone, I can show you the location of the people threatening to come here and vandalize the hell out of Wikipedia. But I do not want that to be part of your decision at all. (please reference the large rebuttle on the discussion page itself)

I have posted this, I hope that some of you will consider looking for my information and reconsider your vote for now. A lot of people are simply responding to the rudeness of user:sin-thetik and some things I said are being misconstrude as threats. I am simply upset because of all the time it took to write these 3 articles, knowing they fit the guidelines, only to have somone delete them with the proof and verifiable facts right in front of them .. just their un-willingness to read them. Please think it over, I appreciate your time.

Hi, thanks for message. You can sign your comments automatically using four tildes ~~~~. Please add your messages to the bottom of the talk page, or they may be overlooked. I deleted your article because 
it did not provide independent verifiable sources to enable us to verify the facts and show that it meets the notability guidelines. It is now Wikipedia policy that biographical articles about living people must have independent verifiable references, or they will be deleted. Although you gave some references, two were to his website, one was reporting what he said, and the third only confirmed that he had left a record label. In any case, it's not clear what makes Hip Hop World an independent third party source as linked above.
I can't actually see from your text how he meets the notability criteria linked above anyway
it was written in a promotional tone. Articles must be neutral and encyclopaedic. Examples of unsourced or self-sourced claims presented as fact include:  He fell in love with hip hop... also inspired... he became interested in the art of lyricism, deciding to further his passion... decided to follow his passion... Known for being able to sing and rapping in pidgin or Yoruba... interest for music became a greater calling he could not ignore... was able to explore his range of musical talent... did not however leave him lacking in his ability to contribute... but it was all good natured fun... working diligently... to give his fans the music they so rightfully deserve...— it's long on mind -reading, opinions and spam, and short of real facts, such as record sales, awards etc.
You have an obvious conflict of interest when it comes to editing articles about this subject. Thank you for declaring your interest. If, after reading the information about notability linked above, you still believe that he is notable enough for a Wikipedia article (and that there is significant coverage in reliable, independent secondary sources), you could, if you wish, post a request at Wikipedia:Requested articles for the article to be created.

PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE CHANGES IN CLIMATE
A major advance of this assessment of climate change projections compared with the TAR is the large number of simulations available from a broader range of models. Taken together with additional information from observations, these provide a quantitative basis for estimating likelihoods for many aspects of future climate change. Model simulations cover a range of possible futures including idealised emission or concentration assumptions. These include 14 SRES  illustrative marker scenarios for the 2000–2100 period and model experiments with greenhouse gases and aerosol concentrations held constant after year 2000 or 2100.

Information needing to be inserted into the article
The translation needs to be continued, and the result wikified and styled. Taken from here. Moved here because Markstreet reverted the article for the 15th time, and I already reverted two times. 

As the Transnistrian referendum deadline approaches, to the support for the separatists from Tiraspol comes disinformation not only from press agencies, but also campaigns in the purest KGB style. This years June month, several publications from Russia and Transdniester made a big deal about the conclusions of a certain report “made by prestigious western experts”, a report which plead for the independence of the separatist region from eastern Moldova. The study was attributed to some institutions with pompous names: """"International Council for Democratic Institutions and State Sovereignty (ICDISS; where Mauco leads) and """"Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group"""". Among the signatures were quoted several well-known Oxford, Standford or Harvard: Stefan Talmon, Christopher Goebel, Nancy Furman, Paul Williams, Stephen Krasner, Andrew Lorenz, Michael Scharf, William Wookd. These were said to have participated in April 2006, at a conference at the Bacon Hotel in Washington, together with several other experts in international law, among which a high ranking official of the US State Department. They all concluded that “Transdniester has all the required criteria for it to be declared an independent state”, thus flagrantly contradicting the official position of all western governments. The Ziua reporters contacted the quoted professors. Astounded, they declared that they do not have any connection with the report mediatised in the Russian press. Stephen Krasner, professor of international relations at Stanford University declared that he didn`t even wrote about Transdniester ever. Michael Scharf, professor at Case Western University, transmitted to us that the authors of the so called report had done nothing else than to copy and adapt an older study of his and of Paul Williams, written over a decade ago, not about Transdniester, but about Nagorno Karabah. Stefan Talmon, professor an Oxford University declared: “I want to make it clear that I was not involved in the writing of this report. I suspect that the implication of the mentioned names was used to give a certain credibility to that report, and to deceive the public”. Ziuas investigation was taken over and continued by the The Economist. After studing the text of the report, the bitish journalist concluded that despite it`s academic language, certain expressions betrayed the fact that English was not the maternal language of the authors. For example, the use of the expression """"telephone centrals"""" instead of """"exchanges"""" is a very common error found in Russian to English translations.The surprises continued. The british journalists found that at the Bacon Hotel in Washington had not taken place any such conference. None of the mentioned personalities had passed through there. About the two organizations which created the study, the journalists came to the conclusion that they are very strange. From the so called Euro-Atlantic Joint Forum Contact Group it appears that there is nothing except the organizations label, informs the Economist in its 3rd August edition, in an article called """"Propaganda Wars Returns"""".

False, my site tenstringguitar.INFO is neither intended to promote a website nor is it a link to a blog. This site promotes scholarly information about the 10-string guitar as envisioned by Narciso Yepes. So 's claims against me/my site are simply dishonest. (Not unexpected.) Along the same vein, 's claim that Janet Marlow's site does not fail any criteria of """"links to be avoided"""" is also false. According to criterion no. 2 """"Any site that misleads the reader by use of factually inaccurate material or unverifiable research"""" must be avoided on wikipedia. Yet  supports this site knowing fully that it is involved in the spread of misinformation.

Compare the claims made by Marlow  with the verifiable statements made by Yepes . 's claims that these are saying the same thing are clearly mistaken or dishonest. That is, Marlow claims """"there are four missing sympathetic resonances on the six string guitar ... C, Bb, Ab, and Gb"""" which have less sustain """"than the others"""". While Yepes states that """"On the six-string guitar only four notes of the scale have natural resonances or overtones, E, A, B, an D"""" and that the other EIGHT sympathetic resonances are missing. 

What  is doing here is not scholarship, it is not honest and it is discrediting wikipedia, but I need hardly say it because it is abundantly clear to readers. He gets away with it simply because he is an administrator.

Also please read this excerpt of what I wrote:

You can thank me later for it but I'll tell you Parseval's identity. It's more conceptual to think of L^2 the space of measurable square-integrable functions on [-pi,pi] as a complex inner product space (Hilbert space). The idea is that the space has an orthonormal basis (general orthornormal basis can be found by wavelets) such as {e^{-in}} for n an integer. And if f is a function in L^2 you can take its inner product against each of these functions and get """"components"""" of f. The point is, as you'd expect in any Hilbert space, the components are the only relevant data when it comes to taking inner products. So you can find the inner product (an integral) of two functions just by knowing their Fourier coefficients. Pretty cool math dude? So basically I advise you to find the Fourier coefficients of the function """"x"""" on [-pi,pi] and take the inner product of this function with itself and apply Parseval. The PROOF of Parseval is probably well beyond the scope of your education; you'll see it when you get to university. It involves proving the completeness of the trigonometric system (in the L^2 case) which can be done nicely with convolution but I'll save the details to your lecturers at first year undergrad. uni. 

I notice you said that you didn't know what """"Fourier series"""" is and it shows since if you did know you'd see that the above is perfectly correct math. Feel free to consult anyone.

Hello again.
I have read through the links, they are very helpful.  Thanks.  I have made the changes to the headings and subheadings, italics instead of bolds and moved the external links to a """"links"""" section rather than in the article.  I have changed the footnotes (thanks for help on that!)and I believe I did as you instructed for the reference list but a strange thing has happened in the Reference section of my article.  I have the references repeating themselves multiple times.  I am not sure what I have done to get this result?

Also, I am interested in building a """"sidebar"""" with a picture and summary of Mulford's life (similar to what is found on Carl Sagan's Wikipage) but for one thing, I don't know what to call it so I can't search for help on creating it within the article.  Can you direct me further?

I believe I have otherwise met the verifiable and reliable sources requirement (although I admit that I have wondered if interviews/personal diaries can be considered valued biographical sources in Wikepedia); I believe I am maintaining a neutral point of view, and I believe Mulford's life to be notable as evidenced by the large collection at UCF of his life's work.  

Once I have everything done I'd like to ask for one last """"preview"""" to see if you see any other glaring problems.

Anti-Serb sentiment is an umbrella term or generalization, obviously it will be poorly sourced just as List of Massacres in the Kosovo war is a WP creation. We find a subject then we link sources/stories to it but many articles do not represent a real world phenomenon. The fact is that Serbophobia as a concept is not a """"myth"""" but it is confined to the nation's sympathizers and is rejected by the nation's detractors. Obviously Serbophobia is more degrading and more emphatic than """"anti-Serb sentiment"""" in that implies an outright hatred. Naturally no Serb can truly accept no nation recognizing their declared states in Croatia (Krajina) and Eatern Bosnia during the Yugoslav Wars, seeing a West-brokered peace deal in 1994 putting at end to Bosniak-Croat hostilities then all uniting for a joint attack to end the Serb rebel states alongside world powers and claiming that the unlawful grounds for existence of those states was that they were not AVNOJ entities - and then a few years later support the UCK in Kosovo, pushing from the first moment to have FRY forces expelled, succeeding after airstrikes then nine years later recognize Kosovo - no AVNOJ argument there. But it doesn't end there, Kosovo achieved widespread positive feedback from US recognition to """"welcoming of independence"""" from organizations such as the Basque authority in Spain - all entitled to their own opinions, but Serbs who claim Serbophobia are neither stupid nor blind to world events. You don't get the same positive and warm reception let alone recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia nor many other would-be states to exist or to have existed before being retaken by an aggressor (in the eyes of locals). These feats give Serbs to feel they are victims of international protectionism and that alone is enough to prove the sentiment. You're not going to convince them with fairy stories about how their heavy-handed 1990s oppression or disproportionate number of atrocities that time influenced on what side nations would eventually fall.

Mass massacre and conversion
According to available documents such as the Shahnameh (Book of Kings) by Ferdowsi (Persian Poet) who took on the great role on preserving the Persian language from being lost; by the order of the Arab commander “Yazid ibn al-Muhallab” in north of Persia, Gorgan, many Persians were beheaded so that their blood, mixed with water would energize the millstone to produce as much as one day's meal for him. As Yazid ibn al-Muhallab had vowed and ordered his soldiers to cut off the tongue of anyone who dared to speak Persian. This is why in Arabic, Persians are called “Ajam”, meaning mute. The event of blood mill has been quoted by the generations of historians and Persian (Iranian) """"Zoroastrian"""" families to this day. In recent years however, disenchanted Iranian scholars have been writing about the blood mills and this event has been reported by Iranian historians of the Islamic era. On the way to Mazandaran Province (Northern Iran), Yazid ibn al-Muhallab also ordered 12,000 Persian captives to be hanged at the two sides of the road so that the victorious Arab army could pass through. Upon arrival, many more were massacred in that province and heavy tax (Jizya) was imposed on the survivors who did not convert to Islam.

Some historians have estimated that a total of 400,000 Persian (Iranian) civilians were massacred. After the battle of Ali, the Arab commander (Khalid ibn al-Walid) ordered all the prisoners of war be decapitated so that a creek of blood flows. When the city of “Estakhr” in the south of Iran put up a stiff resistance against the Arab invaders, 50,000 residents were slaughtered. One of the battles by the Arabs has been named, “Jelovla” (Covered), because an estimated 100,000 bodies of the slain Persian soldiers covered the desert.

It is reported that 130,000 Persian women and children were enslaved and sold in the Mecca and Medina markets and large amounts of gold and silver were plundered. One respected Iranian scholar recently wrote, “Why so many had to die or suffer? Because one side was determined to impose his religion upon the other who could not understand”. The Arabs colonized, exploited, raped and despised the Persians (Iranians). They even named the Persian converts “Mawali” or “Liberated Slaves”.

Persian rebellion

Babak Khorramdin was one of the main Iranian (Persian) iconic rebels against the Arab invasion. He alongside his wife (Banu Khorramdin) fought against the Arabs for an estimated time of 23 years and won every battle. Records show that Babak and his army of Khurramites killed over 500,000 invading Arabs.

Caliph Umar, who was behind the conquest of Persia was assassinated in November 644 by a Persian who had been enslaved Pirouz Nahavandi. Piruz was also behind the murder of Ali, however knowledge of Piruz's death is unclear.  Hormuzan is said to have masterminded this plot. Caliph Uthman ibn Affan (644–656) succeeded Umar. During his reign almost the whole of the former Sassanid empire's territory rebelled from time to time until 651, until the last Sassanid emperor Yazdegerd III was assassinated near Merv ending the Sassanid dynasty and Persian (Iranian) resistance to the Muslims. The main rebellion was in the Persian provinces of Armenia, Azerbaijan, Fars Province (Pars), Sistan in 649, Tabaristan, Khorasan (651), and Makran (650).

Perhaps he should express within the article and note it as such, but clearly it is not reasonable to expect this view to be represented equally with generally accepted facts. 
I feel that this is mostly a well written and informative article and that this whole coup or counter coup thing is pointless. These events are accepted by most sources to have been a coup. What this means is that Mossadeq is accepted to have been the leader of Iran at the time in question, and to have been deposed. The phrase counter-coup implies that Mossadeq deposed the Shah first, which according to the ample scholarship cited in this article, is not what happened. 
It is of course possible that the concensus of scholarship on this issue is in error, but those who beleive this to be the case are by definition, holders of minority viewpoints. 
That said, I do think Shervink's views are interesting and should be included (and noted as a minority viewpoint) in the article.

Generally speaking, the births of descendants of QV are generally noted as such (or trivially determinable as such).  The birth announcements can not, obviously """"rank"""" any order of succession as it is constantly in a state of flux.

Agree strongly with BilCat. The comparable list should be there to illustrate what might be in the air at the same time, doing a broadly similar job, on the same side, on the opposing side, or neutral. The facts (hopefully) in those articles should make it clear how comparable planes are, and importantly make it clear to what degree one can really know and to what degree of generality.

On closer examination of the history pages of the main article, it appears some of Malke's biased edits, through sheer volume, are still in effect.  I propose going through every edit of his, see exactly what changes of his have survived, and put back all relevant, sourced material.  Once that is effected, we can pick up the chore of dealing with further improvements.   

Having just returned to WP from an extended absence, I am not fully familiar with what has occurred with this article, but cursory skimming of the talk page reminds me of some of the frustrations which led me to leave WP more than a year ago. I recognize Malke's concerns. Material that is added back should strictly follow WP:BLP, ie., it should be directly relevant to Rove, not defamatory, and should be sourced by reliable secondary sources.   

Malke's concerns were one thing, his methods another.  Admins blocked him not only due to his violation of the three edit rule, but because he was deleting paragraphs of properly sourced material, and as the admins noted (to quote directly from Malke's talk page history, since he has since, for obvious reasons, deleted all reference to his blocking):

These admins had not been involved here previously; they took firm, direct action on a disruptive editor, Malke, who was judged to be making """"untrue"""" statements regarding his efforts.

Ernie Smith writes 

Æµ§œš¹ I attempted to address the question that you posed regarding other inaccuracies but at the behest of User Hoary I have been blocked by the Wikipedia administrators.  That said, you should carefully examine what I did in fact state regading the four ways that Baugh posits as being the Afrocentric proponent's view on Ebonics.  I maintain that just because a writer happens to be Black or African American (Weddington, Baugh and Green for example) being Black does not make their postion on Ebonics Afrocentric.  What I stated was that; """"the proponents of the term Ebonics view and use the word Ebonics only one way.  That way being; from an Africa centered comparative linguistic perspective.""""  I went on to state that """"In fact, a careful analysis of what Baugh posits as number (iii) reveals that this view is not Afrocentric at all.  That is, the view that Ebonics “is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English"""" (and thus merely an alternative term for African American Vernacular English|AAVE” is Eurocentric.  The other three views, numbers (i), (ii) and (iv), are Afrocentric..."""" 

Æµ§œš¹, if you re-read the quote above carefully you will see that are clearly in error regarding what I stated concerning Baughs number (ii).  So let me make it clear here. It is my view that the first phrse in number (ii)that reads; """"to refer to the languages of the African diaspora as a whole”, is definitely Afrocentric.  What I questioned was the second phrase or clause in number (ii) that reads; “or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language|English: either”.  I contend that this phrase contradicts the first phrase and is therefore and oxymoron.  The fact that Eurocentric writers attempt to filch, redfine and use the word Ebonics to """"refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of English language"""" does not make this practice Afrocentric.

To User:DESiegel

I am indeed very well aware that languages change over time. In fact I co-authored a book on the origin of the """"N' word and in that book I extensivly addressed how the meaning of the Kemetic (Egyptian)word NGR has changed.  In this book Shaba Shebaka and I systematically demonstrate that while all English language dictionaries posit the origin of the 'N' word as being derived from the Latin word 'niger' meaning 'black', (See Ullaman, et.al. Third Latin Book (1930:51) the word 'niger' is not originally a Latin word. (see America Heritage Dictionary (1976:1531) That is, while the word 'niger' may have entered into the English langange from Latin, the empirical evidence is that the tri-consonant Mdw Ntr 'NGR' is found in the ancient Kemetic (Egyptian) language thousnds of years before there is any record of a Latin civilization.  The empirical evidence is that the root word NGR was introduced to the Ayran or European people when they initially invaded and made contact with the Negroid people (NGRS) of ancient India around 2000-1000 BC. (See Wallbank and Taylor(1942:72,73)and Durant (1954:356).

In Sir E.A. Wallis Budge's Egypitian Hieroglyphic Dictionary the words NGRS and NGGR can be found in hieroglyphs.  Budge provides the specific site where these hieroglyphs are located in Egypt today.  As defined by Budge the first word NGRS is the name of an ancient Kemetic or Egyptian God (Budge 1978:341).  The second word NGGR is the name of an ancient Kemitic or Egyptian Goddess (Budge 1978:398).  For the Wikipedia reader that may be concerned as to the relavence of this discussion of the 'N' word to Ebonics I strongly urge the reader to examine the etymology and definition of the word """"ebony"""" in any unabridged English language dictionary. The point being made is that there is a subtle linguistic diglossia being imposed that must to be challenged.  Einar Haugen states the point I am making thusly:  """"if we call the building-up of a language an Aufbau and the aphasic dismantling an Abbau, the bilinguals restructuring can be call an Umbau.  This is the goal of all the studies if bilingual interference: in what way has a language been rebuilt or umgebaut because of the coexistence with another language in the minds ofbilingual speakers?""""  Of course to those who view Ebonics as being a dialect of English the idea of 'biligualism' when it comes to the languge of descendants of enslaved Niger-Congo Africans in diappora is unfathomable.

9d5626371a93681e,"Vandalism etc report against User:Signalhead

I'm not sure why it was incorretly made but I reproduce it here as requested.

I wish to make an allegation of persistent Vandalism against the owner of the account ‘Signalhead’ for repeated vandalism of articles, to which: deletion of material edited into those articles which Signalhead disagrees with their being there, such contributions being legitimate edits and not vandalism in themselves (other than Signalhead unilaterally deciding that he doesn't want them there).

The articles in question are on a railway subject matter and it is clear that Signalhead has unilleterally appointed himself as an ‘expert’ who has decided to ‘own’ the articles and persistently arbitrates on what material may or may not be edited into the article.  I refer in particular to three articles, 'Home Signal'; ‘Token (Railway Signalling)’ and ‘Signal Passed at Danger’ (And I must thank Signalhead himself for providing the evidence of that last article where he tried to use a claimed erroneous edit as evidence of a false claim of sockpupetry – it has become clear that another contributor (or even contributors) feel the same way I do).

Whenever edits are made to those articles, Signalhead has often just deleted (vandalism:blanking) the edit claiming the information is just wrong or ‘erroneous’ without permitting any discussion on the point.  Further the blanking takes place anything from a few minutes to a few hours which clearly demonstrates that Signalhead is watching the articles to make sure that no ‘unsuitable’ material is placed there and to ensure that he can delete any material which he believes is incorrect.  This demonstrates an arrogant ‘know it all’ attitude to other Wikipedia contributors and is, against the principles on which Wikipedia is based.  This unacceptable behaviour brings wikipedia into disrepute by discouraging legitimate contributors from actually contributing to the content of articles.

For my own part, I specifically refer to Signalhead’s blanking of an edit at 16:44 on the 15th September to article ‘Token (railway signalling)’, with an edit summary of ‘Removed Erroneous comments …’ because he thinks he knows better (vandalised within 4 hours).  Signalhead also vandalised the article ‘Home Signal’ at 11:42 27th October 2007 when he blanked an edit from another contributor in the article with the familiar ‘Reverted erroneous edit’ justification, within 3 hours of the contribution, again because he claimed to know better.  I reverted this blanking when I added an illustration that supported the blanked text.  However, Signalhead just vandalised the article again by blanking the edit at 17:07 on the 27th October 2007 with a ‘Reverted to earlier and better version’ justification, less than 2 hours after the restoration.  Signalhead did add something to the article discussion page, but regardless of that he had no right to just blank the contribution no matter how much of an authority he thinks he may be on the subject matter.  He should have discussed the matter first and then the article should have been adjusted by consensus.

I note that another contributor has also expressed exasperation with Signalhead's persistent blanking and adjudication of article content in a somewhat more unorthadox manner.

I offer the short times between contribution and blanking and the blanking itself as evidence that Signalhead is watching ‘his’ articles and deleting any ‘unsuitable’ (in his eyes) content.

With Signalhead’s apparent familiarity of finding his way around Wikipedia, I find it hard to believe that he is unaware of the rules.

I must therefore insist that Signalhead’s editing rights be permanently revoked for the following reasons.

1.TABPersistent blanking of other contributors edits which constitutes persistent vandalism.

2.TABArroganct contempt towards other Wikipedia contributors by adopting an attitude that he knows better than everyone else (which is a clear abuse of those contributors).  Even to the extent of making false allegations to detract from his own violation of the rules.

3.TABAdopting a self appointed role of deciding what can and can’t be contributed to articles which he has decided to ‘own’ and thus …

 Someone keeps erasing this with no comment to me...very unethical.

````Please do not block me for trying to improve the integrity of the article.
Hello, My name is JohnHistory. I was recently blocked for my mentioning of major problems here because I did not assume """"Good Faith"""" when confronted with bad faith. I believe that the biggest problem with this article and thus the best way to improve it is to intensely follow the Jimbo guidelines to the T. I am going to post what I wrote on my talk page after being blocked during the controversy here. I could be more covert in my contempt for violations especially given my long but yet humble ranking amongst the Wiki Elite but abusing editors and monitors must be accountable or we will always suffer from their petty tyranny. This surely does not make me popular amongst them, yet I must assume """"good faith"""" in them so that they will not prejudice their views against me and comfort their own politics in the process.
I was accused of supporting things I never did. All I ask is that criticism be included on par with other presidents. That is all. I don't especially care about Rev Wright, etc but if it is historical record and part of historically long campaign then I will stick my neck out for it.
I have to say that the amount of bashing of media and talk that has nothing to do with improving the article is highly tolerated if it is left leaning but anything even center of that is treated with heavy hand and often banished and erased. that is what struck me about the discussion page - mind you I never made an edit on the actual article I was banned for merely talking on a talk page. it was the idea that these so called monitors are in fact just random non scholars at home abusing the tools of wikipedia to further their almost personal agenda in a group- think environment.
Thin skin is no excuse for being literally fascistic in your approach to the open to the public - controlled by a small group of ideologues - Wikipedia. These political minding ideologues are 80-100% dominated by left wing or leaning people and controlled through even the excessive use of blocking for discussion posts and factual additions. These (not just mine) are non threatening non- offensive language - just the idea of one stating that their is a problem with the editors and monitors is cause to be blocked and potentially banned for not """"assuming good faith"""" or """"positively contributing to the consensus"""". what if the consensus is wrong then? What if about if you have already assumed Good Faith long ago and are simply diagnosing the major illness of the article as you see it? The evidence is more then abundant that these monitors are violating their tools and are involved in subterfuge or at least strong bias as evidenced between comparing Obama with W Bush. Additionally, the Obama Administration through proxies, in my strong opinion, is at work in the Obama article. I say this mainly because it is inconceivable to me that given the current administrations use and celebration of all things internet and aggressive pursuit of media outlets and shaping the publics opinion (as is understandable) that someone out of the thousands of Obama connected likely people is not involved on the Barack Obama page. It is the most visited page on Wikipedia and is one of the top hits for people searching the internet for the name Barack Obama. However, that is secondary to the already abundant supply of ideologue editors and monitors who seem to fill the demographic of the wikipedia junior officer ranks who enough of is all that it really takes. The number of those is in the millions. That is Why Jimbo guidelines must be followed as an example of the integrity of wikipedia as a REAL encyclopedia that could stand out in a scholarly work. The language given the Rulers of Wikipedia gives them broad ability to block and ban anyone they disagree with. OFten the language is contradictory. For instance I was blocked for my comments on the TALK page and cited for """"Making a point instead of wanting to edit"""". How, exactly, do you make a TALK page based discussion about edits without making a point? Another monitor told me I had to assume good faith, yet no good faith was given to me in my quest to improve article. In addition, the """"TALK"""" page says no writing will be allowed that involves """"general discussion"""" however that can be loosely interpreted and it could for instance only be 5% of what you wrote and then be grounds by a prejudiced monitor to remove your entire sections containing many posts. Additionally, the last guideline about general talk is only applied to people making comments critical or potentially scandalous to the President of the United stat",0,0,0,0,0,0

Discouraging (without banning) month and day of birth or death is not consensus, although it is the strong opinion of many editors, disputed by many others, at at a straw poll currently being  conducted at Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (dates and numbers). Since Jane Austen's editors have apparently decided against having an Information Box (which could display exact birthday and date of death), I think the argument for keeping them quickly accessible in this particular lead is rather stronger. And although I'm more of a Dickensian than an Austenite myself, I know several people in the San Francisco Bay Area who diligently celebrate Jane Austen's birthday with an annual ball.

Energy Accounting is a hypothetical system of distribution, which would record the Energy used to produce and distribute goods and services consumed by citizens in a Technate. The units of this accounting system would be known as Energy CertificatesThese would replace money in a Technate, but unlike traditional money or currencies, energy certificates could not be saved or earned, only distributed evenly among a populace. The amount of certificates given to each citizen would be calculated by determining the total productive capacity of the technate and dividing it equally. The Energy Certificates themselves would probably not have to be physically used by the populace, as the system would be computerised. In energy accounting the Technate would use information of Natural resources, industrial capacity and citizen’s purchasing habits to determine how much of any good or service was being consumed by the populace, so that it could match production with consumption.

The reason for the use of Energy Accounting serves to ensure the highest possible standard of living as well as equality among the Technate’s citizenry, as well as prohibit spending that is beyond the productive capacity of the technocracy.Energy Accounting An article on Energy Accounting as proposed by Technocracy Inc.

 - WP:BLPGOSSIP states that Be wary of sources that use weasel words and that attribute material to anonymous sources. I am not aware of any weasel words or attribution to anonymous sources. I am not sure how the section applies, if you could be more clear it would be helpful.
 - The phrase involve claims about third parties is so vague as to not be any assistance. By this metric, so little can be used that it's almost meaningless. Someone stating their birthdate, or the grade school they attended. But for a person saying """"I have a conflict with Jenny Smith over Issue X"""" - where do we draw the line? It could easily be said that an actor and actress divorcing, with one placing on their personal (publicist) website a statement about """"separating for reasons of X"""" is a """"claim about third parties"""", but I wouldn't argue it is unreliable nor unencyclopedic to include in the biography of either individual.

 criticism of jesus/plucking eyeballs out/slavery 

Jesus has been criticized as vindictive, intolerant, prudish, and unkind. Several scholars have noted that he appears to condone slavery.
 
−TABTAB 
−TAB
The cardinal Avery Robert Dulles stated that Jesus “said not a word against slavery as a social institution"""", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either.  In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, """"but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery,” and argues that Jesus must have then condoned it.  
 
−TABTAB 

How come the Catholic removed this section in his words """"because it didn't appear to be criticism"""" is this a joke?  
−TAB
Friedrich Nietsche argued that “a war was declared on passion” in the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says of sexual temptation: """"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out."""" According to Nietsche, “Destroying the passions and cravings, merely as a preventive measure against their stupidity and the unpleasant consequences of this stupidity, today this itself strikes us as merely another acute form of stupidity. We no longer admire dentists who """"pluck out"""" teeth so that they will not hurt any more…. the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises.”[Friedrich Nietzsche, 1878, Human all too Human: A Book for Free Spirits, The Wanderer and His Shado, aphorism 83] """,1,0,0,0,0,0

“""""argument by argument"""" (tm)”?  If you have to invent a fallacy then even you have to know that you’re grasping for straws.

Collect, we do not have to say “the world is regarded as being round by some members of the scientific community” any more than we have to say “water has never definitively been proven to be wet”.  While I would personally prefer that we said something like “Ham’s claims have been disproven by modern science” (because I think it sounds more authoritative), if it’s between “incorrect” or nothing then “incorrect” is clearly the superior choice because it is factually true.

And please don’t try that “all the intelligent readers already know he’s wrong so there’s no need to point out that he’s wrong” argument.  Every fringe-pusher and their uncle has already tried that tactic and it’s bullshit.  We can’t just allow Wikipedia to be full of rubbish and assume that the smart readers will filter the fact from the fiction.  76.107.171.90

Mlpearc says he still agrees that I am """"unnotable"""" for thew record and thinks I should be """"speedily deleted.""""

I'm an internationally known author and Holocaust scholar. Amazon sells 19 of my books, only four of which were self-published.

Amazingly, Mlpearc boasts on his Talk page or Wiki internal bio he's a high school drop out but DOES have his GED! I suspect there is a LOT of professional rivalry...in Mlpearc's mind, not in the opinion of Wiki editors who way back in 2011 decided to KEEP my Wiki bio because Wiki DOES think I'm notable.

Mlpearc's comment above about still believing I'm a nobody doesn't rankle me. If there is ONE thing I am NOT insecure about it's my resume and other credentials. But Mlpearc's opinion that I'm not notable sounds rude to me.

Anybody else agree?

Again, THIS IS NOT A REQUEST TO UNBLOCK ME!Italic text I am through editing my Wiki bio. I'll let Mlpearc and nonsenseferret continue to inadvertently vandalize my Wiki bio, misspelling Hitler, my last name TWICE, etc. 

I have a book to write. I shouldn't be wasting my time with you clowns in here, but right now I'm Kindlizing my book, which is boring and NOT gratifying. Instead, I'm using the poor substitute of posting flaming new sections on my Talk page. Pathetic! I'm pathetic.

Exactly what part of GFY don't you non-readers understand? You can't ban me. I'm abandoning my Wiki bio to you incompetent butchers who post notes on my Talk page restating claims that I'm not notable despite the 2011 KEEP determination by Wikipedia.

Vandalism Manifesto. Pass to all Wikians

VANDALISM IS GOOD. Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm.
Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred, 
because incompetent """"editors"""" who have no skills, no degrees, no expertise, usually no names, have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others.
Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who 
do 7000 edits, 10,000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1,300
or more and are proud of it. These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins, 
bureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD. It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns. The Culture of Wikipedia is very,very sick,
and Vandals are needed to """"cull the herd"""". SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL VANDAL.

 WIKIPEDIA IS COMMUNISM!!!! 

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it h",1,0,0,0,0,0

VANDALISM IS GOOD. Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm.
Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred,

Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who

Evils of Atheism

It's about damn time somebody taught atheists their own medicine, and before you ask, I do not generalize, I think there's a cultural distinction between atheism and nonbelievers. Atheists tend to be enraged over religion of any kind, and spend a lot of time elevating Darwin and bemoaning the Crusades. Nonbelievers in general - say, someone who's raised a Christian, believes the Bible is an allegory, and only attends church for a funeral or perhaps at Christmastime - tend to adopt a """"Whatever gets you through the night"""" philosophy and be quiet on matters of faith. It's sort of like the difference between a devout vegetarian and someone who hates the taste of meat. Atheists are proud of their hate. It is something that they love devoutly and use it to hate christians.""",0,0,0,0,0,1

 My Statement 

Oh wow, I take a little drive and come back to a nuclear war zone? I guess I can take on each point...

 The fact that MF was not blocked for the same behavior is rather odd (also... if you ask a question after telling me to stop replying... what do you really expect?).
 I agree that Tan needed to be blocked and I agree with the desysopping. 
 To say that I have no right to be angry is a foolhardy notion. I was told multiple times to fuck off (btw, when told to fuck off, I am considerably less likely to comply).
 . They both hail from the infamous Tiscali network. That being said, rpeh has no reason to be involved in this discussion (he has a personal issue with me ever since he was desysopped on another wiki; he hasn't gotten over it). I intend to request a checkuser and request a block for sockpuppetry.
 User:Georgewilliamherbert places too much weight on unofficial warnings. A vandal can be warned four times but a user once? Hmmmm...
 Prodego has no reason to be desysopped. He had every right to block for a violation of WP:NPA tens of times.

 Image caption - Homosexual? 

The second image of an infected persons back has a caption which reads:
""""A 23-year-old homosexual man had an intensely pruritic, papulonodular eruption over his arms and back.""""

How is the fact, that the man is homosexual, relevant? The sexual orientation does not change the course of the desease and I believe that the comment could enforce the stereotype, that homosexual people are all infected with STDs.
I think it should just say """"A 23-year-old man...""""

Once more the mark of someone 'wet behind their ears' and not willing to do the research... I GUESS everything that is required of a 'good' editor/administrator, HERE.

I've had this same problem with the 'Wiki' bastards in Australia... Spouting revisionist history, and trying to tell ME that I never did the things that I actually did, and pronouncing 'harsh-judgment'/condemnation on the things I DIDN'T...

What the hell is the matter with you 'types'? (rhetorical, actually)... Because I already know: You hide behind 'avatars' and sit on your 'high-and-mighty-thrones' to try and dictate to other people about THEIR OWN LIVES... Politically, you're VERY likely LIBERAL, and ethically/morally, quite obviously BANKRUPT! In short, individuals of your 'persuasion' cannot make it in the outside world, so you 'bury' & 'busy' yourselves in 'safe' [for you] places like this, where you can exert an imagined 'power' over others and their lives, through KEYSTROKE TERROISM - THAT'S WHAT IT AMOUNTS-TO... I'M NOT THE DANGER/THREAT WITH THESE MESSAGES,  BECAUSE I'M OUT HERE AND PUBLIC... BUT YOU ARE, BECAUSE YOU CAN HIDE BEHIND ALL OF THIS, SO YOU BELIEVE YOU ARE PROTECTED, AND CAN STRIKE OUT AT PEOPLE WITH 'IMPUNITY'... BUT, YOU REALLY CANNOT. I FEEL SAD FOR YOU... YEAH, RIGHT!! 

Well, I'm going to be the 'bigger man' here (even though I believe it said YOU were some kinda' editor CHICK)... I'll leave you to do what you want in your own, lil' limited SANDBOX, and I'll just go about my usual business - IN THE OUTSIDE WORLD; THE REAL WORLD! - where what is accomplished really matters, is truly appreciated, and people actually give a good, god-damn about accuracy and the true efficacy of all their hard-fought-for efforts.

I wish you well... I'd wish your 'husband' well, also, although I doubt that you have one... for the above, obvious reasons cited - and IF ya' ever did [ya' sweet, lil' monkey you], he likely 'BOLTED' long ago... either that, or ya' probably 'edited' his ass out of existence TOO!

Poor Guy... Oh well...

Oh, and here is the response I posted, that got erased: 

REDVEЯS, I do not feel my comments are poisonous. Other people agree with me. The """"good editor"""" you describe is often very harsh in his dealings with others and seems to put his own personal pride ahead of common sense when he prevents pictures other than his from being used. As far as I know, most people on Wikipedia conceal their true identities including David Shankbone and yourself. To be called cowardly for merely highlighting the anonymity we all use is ridiculous. You say my criticism of David Shankbone is disgusting. What I find disgusting are his insensitive, uncaring, and simply awful author photos, and the egotistical ways he defends them.
And here is my response to you, David Shankbone: There's a difference between attending a public event and expecting a photo to appear for one day in a local newspaper, vs. having that event define your permanent image on a site as widely used as Wikipedia. Your animosity toward authors demonstrates your own lack of a NPOV. Your history with Sharyn November is more complicated than you describe. She at first repeatedly tried to take down the photo you took of her (as anyone can see in the history of her page), and it wasn't until you used intimidation (on a talk page I think, by implying she shouldn't even be writing on her page due to neutral point of view issues and might be blocked) that she immediately backed down and got friendly, clearly out of fear that you would block her. —Preceding unsigned comment added by Anonymous 374 (talk • contribs) """,1,0,0,0,0,0

 Practical proposal for change based on evidence provided above 
Simple to read for assholes who refuse to read:
Proposals:
1) change phrasing in intro
2) do not change focus of the majority of the page on the """"close circle""""
3) perhaps make """"writers"""" section more reader friendly for casual readers with a chart, or something quick and simple to read
4) change naming of """"writers"""" section to something reflected broader scope
5) I would like something like 3 & 4 to be closer to the top, but I do recognize Doom's concern that it weighs down the intro, so we can see for now if it works.

I'm suggesting no change beyond that, but I feel I have provided the beginning of sufficient evidence to support the necessity of this change.
