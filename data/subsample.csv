1907704adff9f0c4,"UPittIT Block 

Hi Orangemike,

Hope you are doing well and I appreciate your work here on Wikipedia. I have some questions regarding the block of UPittIT. Although I too have some concerns with this account which primarily are the lack of this editor's responsiveness to numerous warnings of copyright concerns (as Hammersoft had pointed out), and editor's lack of engagement in dialogue regarding these issues. This could be simple misunderstanding of the copyright policy for the editor's user space, but the repeated violations are disconcerting. In fact, I can't be entirely sure that the user account is only one person (a kind of reverse sockpuppetry that makes me uneasy). However, it is my understanding that editors are not in WP:COI solely due to their place of employment or username, but rather because of the issues of POV, reliability and neutrality of their contributions. However, in this case, my particular my concern is the work the editor had done in his or her own sandbox (the now deleted  issues, this had not been demonstrated because all of his/her work (as far as I know) had been confined his/hers user sandbox. The editor was an obvious newbie, and had twice sought feedback (see here and here) and had been responsive to suggestions demonstrated by the removal of pervasive external links, downsizing of the article, rewriting so it was not in violation of WP:NOTDIR, and the addition of outside, neutral third-party references. In fact, although I did not see any of the editor's additions to this particular article since July 7th, in my opinion, it contained useful information, was notable, and was ready to be moved from the user space into Wikipedia proper. Mostly, I would request that this page be restored, as I would like to create that particular article myself and will not be able to duplicate the off-line references from various library science journals that had been inserted. I guess you could say that I primarily lament the loss of this particular article. I would appreciate your thoughts on this issue, and your review of the D-Scribe Digital Publishing article circa the July 7th version as I would like to see if there is anything salvageable from that (sans the copyright violations that Hammersoft elucidated).

8bfcc9a6cb99abb1,"While it may be true that there are thousands of trolls for Richard Kastle and Lang Lang... there is a huge difference. Although Lang Lang does (visually) look like an idiot when he performs with his weird facial expressions and over exaggerated face... he still happens to be a brilliant pianist (in the pieces where he doesn't decide to go 10 times the speed as directed.) 

Richard Kastle however as far as I (or many other people have tried) know has never had a single CD published or recorded. The fact that on the entirety of YouTube there is about 30 seconds of actual footage of Richard Kastle playing and a still shot of him on a Jay Leno show. 

Many of the so called 'trolls' that abuse Richard Kastle have a right to do so, due to the fact that a couple of psychologically disturbed people who praise him for being the greatest pianist of all time are truly wrong. There is also video footage on YouTube of a guy (who I believe is Kastle) discrediting major pianists such as Horowitz and Cziffra because they 'supposedly' simplified parts of their repertoire. This is completely NOT true due to the fact that University Professionals and other Professional Pianists would easily have picked up such a disregard for the music, in seconds. 

This article on Richard Kastle should be deleted due to the fact that it is just another excuse for one of those psychologically disturbed people who praise him for being the greatest pianist of all time, to brag about a man who does not deserve the credit he deserves. If it IS true that Kastle did actually discredit the great pianists - this page should be taken down for praising a slander who has the audacity to verbally abuse the good name and brilliant talent of the pianists who are deceased and have no way of discrediting this so called fraud called 'Richard Kastle'.

you demanded some facts.  here you go;
Dursun Karatas was not born in 1953, but 1950.  most of the infos about Dursun Karatas at internet suggest he was born in 1953.  it is definately wrong. if you look at original Devrimci Sol court documents, you will see he was born 27 March 1950.  he has enrolled to Universityof Istanbul in 1967 at the age of 17.if he was born in 1953, it means he enrolled to university at the age og 14 which is not possible.  

In 1978 he founded Dev-Sol (Revolutionary Left, precursor of DHKP-C).[2] Karataş' group was based in Istanbul.[3]

this is not a fact.  the organisation was not based in Istanbul.  He was representative of Devrimci Yol in Istanbul branch when he established Devrimci Sol, splinter organisation from devrimci Yol.  Even turkish texas ranger that you used his report as a """"fact"""" states it, if you carefully read it.  Devrimci Sol is not based in Istanbul, but all over Turkey, especially, Adana, Izmir etc.

Karataş was jailed after the 1980 military coup. In prison a political reorganisation was undertaken. The Dev-Sol inmates at Bayrampaşa prison refused to follow orders and boycotted court invitations. 

This is not true as well.  They have boycotted the torture and inhumane processes in prison.  Of course, torture is not mentioned at any documents or internet facts, but does not mean ut was existed.  The organisation protested torture in prison and Devrimci Sol started a hunger strikes, 4 inmates (sorry, terrorist for you and turkish texas ranger, bearing in mind, one of the terrorist lost his life during hunger strike was imprisoned with the accusation of putting up posters in the walls, punishable with 6 months imprisonment nowadays), lost their lives.  

In prison Karataş wrote Haklıyız Kazanacağız, a work which included analysis of past mistakes of the Dev-Sol movement and lists of enemies of the organization. It was published in two volumes in 1989, spanning more than 1000 pages.[3][4][5]

He did not write it, but all Devrimci Sol prisoners.  As a matter a fact Sinan Kukul prapered the book.  If you read the book earlier version you would see. (don't use sun glasses when you read it).  Lists of enemies of the organisation..... what a fuck is that.  there is no such thing in the book.  their past mistakes......  the book consisted with Devrimci Sol ideologies, its aim etc.      

He escaped from prison in 1989.[6] After escaping from jail, he went into exile in Europe.[4] In 1989-1990 Dev-Sol carried out a series of attacks. However, on July 12, 1991, Turkish police was able to dismantle several cells of the organization. Karataş fled to Europe. In April 1992 his wife Sahabat was killed by Turkish police.[3]

Following the police crackdown on Dev-Sol, Karataş was kidnapped and detained by the second-in-command of the movement, Bedri Yağan, on September 13, 1993. Karataş did however escape from captivity, and Dev-Sol was divided. Karataş and his followers reorganized their movement as DHKP-C.[3]

following police crack down....   very funny, second in command bedri Yagan,.... this is a joke not fact.  Bedri Yagan was experiencin some problems theredore whatever his duties with in the organisation was removed before his action.  see Devrmci Sol Dava Dosyasi.  turkish texas ranger mentioned this in his report.

this is not your fault of course, the facts about the organisation and its leader were delibrately changed and munipilated by turkish security forces and its collobraters.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

If you want to include Krivosheev's figures, then add a sentence along the lines of """"G. F. Krivosheev, however, places the Soviet losses much higher, at 178,507 killed...""""

My favourite music is the ragtime of Scott Joplin which I play since nearly 40 yrs, starting when I was 16 and got my frist piano from a school colleague. My second piano was a G.Adams, Wesel upright which I got from my Bro-in-law who is a professional organist for the catholic churc in GER. This piano served me for 29 yrs and is now in service for an internet girlfriend some 30mls away.

The purpose of operation Flavius was to prevent the bombing of the military band and the purpose of the PIRA cell in Gibraltar, was to place a bomb in a public place to effect that.  Hiding that is a distortion of both the official IRA statement that they were on 'active service' and the inquest verdict.

Its highly regretable that people are shot on our streets, and unlike some places, its not an everyday occurance. Indeed nobody has been shot since - but although there is no crime of 'being Irish in Gibraltar' it remains the position that terrorists can, and will be shot. Although we do not anticipate any more visits from Ireland, due to the proximity to North Africa there are new threats.

One of the NYT articles cited says that the position with Britain is complicated because it does not have a written constitution - this is sloppy journalism because Gibraltar has one and despite a subsequent version, the section which deals with this incident remains 'as was'.",0,0,0,0,0,0

For a certain editor
""""In 1952 BMW in West Germany produced its first car since before the Second World War. The 501 competed with and failed in terms of performance, price and engineering excellence to match the middle-range sedans made by Mercedes-Benz. The 502 was a still more dismal failure. In the years that followed BMW made every mistake in the book. They launched expensive new luxury models with temperamental high performance engines in a country that had not yet recovered its prewar confidence. They suffered huge losses, panicked, and attempted to escape downmarket by making “bubble cars” under licence for an Italian company, Isetta.

These cars had some success in post-imperial Britain where there was no Marshall Plan and the Suez Crisis brought on the first of many oil shocks. But Germany in the late 1950s was enjoying the fruits of Wirtschaftswunder. The country that had been in ruins only ten years earlier was no longer poor enough for the BMW Isetta Motor-Coupé, known colloquially but never popularly as “the egg”""""

Extract from: Car Wars, Fifty Years of Greed, Treachery, and Skulduggery in the Global Marketplace by Jonathan Mantle

But then there was a fuel crisis and so, briefly, the Germans bought it. What a happy happy accident.

""""The BMW Isetta. Despite its reputation for automotive elegance and craftsmanship, BMW laid a multimillion dollar egg in the 1950s with its Isetta minicar, sneeringly dubbed, “das rollende Ei” or “the rolling egg” The Isetta’s engine was in the rear; passengers exited and entered through the nose of the car as if it were a D-Day troop carrier. In fact, when the front door swung open the steering column and dashboard came with it. As for safety, the entire vehicle, front to back, was one big crumple zone.

Steering the Isetta was difficult, largely because its body was tapered towards the rear, like a wedge of Emmenthaler cheese. Most models had only three wheels, which didn’t make the car any easier to control. But the design enabled the manufacturers to have the Isetta officially classified a motorcycle and thus taxed at cheaper rates.""""

                          The Colour out of Space      

I dreamed that I was in the grasp of a great and horrible paw; a yellow,hairy, five-clawed paw which had reached out of the earth to crush and engulfme. And when I stopped to reflect what the paw was, it seemed to me thatit was Egypt. - HP Lovecraft

This is only a test

At 5:05 on November 22, 1977, regular television programming in southern England was interrupted by a voice claiming to be that of """"Grahama,"""" representative of the """"Ashtar Galactic Command,"""" bearing the usual """"space brother"""" boilerplate of coming in peace to save us from ouselves at the dawn of a New Age. It was quickly dismissed as a hoax, but an extremely complicated one to execute. 

Though the The Sunday Times the following December 4 surmised it was accomplished by students using just """"£80 worth of equipment powered by an ordinary car battery,"""" no one ever claimed responsibility, and independent investigations found that the message must have cut into at least five transmitters simultaneously,and it evaded detection by monitoring equipment which did not even register an interruption, """"suggesting it was achieved in some way that by passed our electrical system.""""

This was actually the second message from Grahama. A month earlier, he had said pointedly that """"We conveyed to Sir John Whitmore and to Dr. Puharich that we would interfere on your radio and television communication systems to relay when the civilisations are coming close to landing on your planet Earth. It is now in motion. We wish you to know that we love you.""""

That """"Grahama"""" would single out the aristocratic former racing champion Whitmore and parapsychologist and MKULTRA researcher Andrija Puharich suggests this was no simple hoax: both men were deeply involved with a decades'-long channelled communication with entities representing a universal hierarchy sometimes called the """"70 Brotherhoods of the Great White Brotherhood."""" The entities governing our reality identified themselves The Nine.

Another link to Whitmore and Puharich was British author Stuart Holyroyd's recently published Prelude to the Landing on Planet Earth, which the two had commissioned as an account of their work with the Nine. In the book, Holroyd wrote that the Nine intended to “interrupt televisionand radio transmissions during the period 18th to 22nd November.”

Regarding the television interruptions, Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince write in The Stargate Conspiracy that, """"as usual, there were only two options considered: either the wholething was genuine and extraterrestrials had really spoken to the southern English through their television sets; or it was hoax, just done for a laugh.The idea that such a message could be easily contrived by, for example, an intelligence agency that would have the necessary technical skills has never,to our knowledge, even been considered.""""

Of course there are several pages about me in that same book and I worked with Puharich for a short while.

This seems a bizarre oversight given the circumstantial connections to Whitmore and Puharich,and especially the latter's service in Army Intelligence and later as a CIA contractor researching the induction of altered states of consciousness.(Whitmore, incidentally, is now also Britain's """"number one business coach,"""" training top executives from companies such as Barclays, Lloyds, Pricewaterhouse Coopers and Rolls Royce.) Uri Geller,for a time one of the Nine's channellers, told Picknett and Prince that """"the CIA brought Puharich in to come and get me out of Israel,"""" and in his essay In the Thick of It, physicist Jack Sarfatti writes that """"Puharich was Geller's case officer in America with money provided by Sir John Whitmore.""""

In the introduction: """"Henry, previously seen by many in the sport as a fair footballer, was labelled by many in the aftermath as a cheat[2]""""
This needs an additional citation for the first part ([2] only refers to him now being labelled a cheat). Henry has never been a fair footballer, the match has just brought to light the foul play he has ALWAYS used to get an upper hand (even the biased french and arsenal fans realise). Furthermore, the quote by Wenger that """"he is one of the fairest players I have managed"""" holds no weight since:

1) It is a biased view from a man who managed Henry for years.

2) It is a view from a man who has managed a great number of cheating players during many years at Arsenal so saying Henry is one of the fairest isn't saying much. 

In summary I think that the line should be changed to:

""""The incident brought to light the true extent of Henry's bad sportsmanship.""""

(There seems to be somewhat of a threshold regarding printing poems in newspapers, on pages allocated to literature reviews etc—the Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten is one example of a newspaper that did not print the poem on a page assigned to literary review.)

As the first section is improved, then it might indicate the chronology of when the very first national newspapers (in various nations) printed translations of the poem. (I would not be suprised if my Nordic country was """"the last Nordic country to print the poem""""—not that anyone necessarily could draw a conclusion from that, even if it is the case.)

Hi there,

I noticed you recently deleted ShivYog Foundation under G11. However, I as author had deleted and re-written most of the article after the deletion notice and contested deletion. Also, there was a Note to Administrators to check the Talk page, which had several notes contesting speedy deletion, but probably they were not noticed. I would request you to take note of them, and Undo the deletion. You may surely add Advert warnings on top and You may delete any text found clearly promotional but preferably not delete the whole page, which is also the preferred Wiki guideline.
There are many similar pages about Indian spiritual organizations with Advert warnings such as

This article falls in similar category , hence should be treated similarly, that is allowed to exist with Advert warnings.

I would really like to begin such an article! I believe it can be created and it could be a great article. There are many people who don´t practice a religion, yet have opinions about the morality of homosexual acts, for instance. In my high school, whenever we had a debate about homosexuality and someone was against or in favor of the acceptance of homosexuality, the arguments used were never religious, and yet a discussion about the morality of homosexuality would happen. Maybe those commmon arguments could be in this article. Like the common view that it is not natural to be gay and therefore it is wrong. And the common answer to this which states that we all do things which are not """"natural"""" every day, like driving a car and using condoms. Or the other answer which would see it as being natural. The same-sex marriage article has some of those moral views independent of a religion.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I have agreed not to mention others by name, but presumably the intelligent people in this group can see that I am both the primary international proponent for Open Source Intelligence, for 20 years, training and nurturing 7,500, and it is both lunacy and immaturity to contintually delete my constructive additions.  As one person notes on the history page, even through I am the author for several of the seminal works (no other person on the planet has written all the main english language handbooks, or the seminal articles in the mainstream published literature, or the two seminal works in TIME and Forbes web pages), this is solid constructivce information that should not be dismissed.

I ask that the person continually undoing my modest constructive work be himself blocked, and that my specific contributions be locked in so as to end this foolishness.

47c1e5941bd69a2a,"""Fish-man, hello, and welcome to Wikipedia.  Thank you for taking the time to examine Wikipedia policies and base your arguments for keeping No-boo on them, and also for being polite when making your arguments.  VfD pages really aren't the place for me to be making lengthy arguments, so I'll respond to your points here instead.

First, you should be aware that anonymous users who sign up for accounts just to argue about the article being voted on are still effectively anonymous users, and are still not going to have their votes counted.  At this point I think it is really too late for you to establish a history at Wikipedia that would result in your vote being counted.  Again I refer you to Wikipedia:Deletion_guidelines_for_administrators#Rough_consensus for this information.  (Anonymous authors who request that their articles be deleted are often given consideration, but not those who want them kept.)
Whether they're specifically enumerated on What Wikipedia is not or not, articles about neologisms are not encyclopedia material.  Firstly, #2 on that page indicates that Wikipedia articles are not dictionary definitions, and as a neologism is just a particular kind of word, an article on a neologism is necessarily a dictionary definition.  Secondly, encyclopedia articles cannot describe neologisms because they cannot describe things that are as yet unestablished.  """"No-boo"""" may or may not be a word with some currency today, but it remains to be seen whether it will become part of the language.  Once we can determine that the term has staying power and is culturally or historically significant—which time will likely not come for months or years—then we can write an article on it.  Or rather, we could, if it weren't going to be just a dictionary definition.
If the article in question is not about a word but actually about an event called """"The No-boo Affair"""", then it ought to be entitled No-boo Affair.  In that case, I would still vote to delete it, on the grounds that it is a news story.  Again, there is no evidence at this time that this news story is going to have any historical significance, and considering that the substance of the news story is """"the AP made a mistake; they said some people booed at a speech but really nobody did"""", it seems very unlikely that it will ever have historical significance.  (You characterize the AP's error as a """"clear falsification"""", but I see no evidence of malicious intent by the AP, and anyway it's still not an encyclopedia's job to document falsehoods by the AP.  If the AP has a history or pattern of such falsehoods, and it is well-documented by other unbiased sources, then we can make a note of it in Associated Press.)  If the term """"no-boo"""" becomes well established—which, again, we will not know for months or years—then perhaps it will be appropriate for us to record this news story as the origin of the term.  Certainly, Wikipedia has articles on other recent news stories.  However, most are stories of definite historical signficance, and those that are not should also be deleted.
Wikipedia wants articles on items that are currently in the news, yes.  In this case there are many things related to the story that people might want to look up.  If we didn't already have them, we could add articles on George W. Bush, William J. Clinton, West Allis, Wisconsin, booing, the Associated Press, the White House, the Republican National Convention, New York, etc.  But this """"No-boo Affair"""" is not an encyclopedic topic in the news; it is a breaking news story.

It is important to understand that an encyclopedia is not simply a gathering of assorted facts, but rather a secondary source that compiles significant pieces of human knowledge that have already been well-established by other sources.  There are many places on the internet and offline where you can disseminate facts and opinions about this event, but Wikipedia is not one of them.  — 18:08, 15 Sep 2004 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

December 26 '07 changes

Certain additions were made on 26th December, which I'm afraid I have felt obliged to remove, for the following reasons:

1) In the section on the Sonnets, the insertion of the comment about Sonnet 86 is in my view unnecessary, as well as turning the paragraph into gibberish. In order to achieve a NPOV we have already removed two paragraphs on the apparent relevance of various other sonnets to the theory, and this one is far less appropriate than most of those which were deleted at that time. 

2) The graph showing the time spans of various authorship candidates is relevant to the article on the Shakespeare authorship question as a whole, but in my opinion adds little of value to this article, the thrust of which is to explain the reasons why Marlovians believe that Marlowe survived 1593 and made a major contribution to Shakespeare's works, and not why anyone else did not. 

3) The opening paragraph of the """"External Evidence"""" section up to """"Shakespeare's grave etc."""" was written as a counter to the argument of whole """"Marlowe's Death"""" section. To then add a counter to that is illogical, even if it had had something to do with external evidence, which it doesn't, and wasn't so obviously written by someone whose first language is not English.

 coppermine-T 

Hi Denniss, i'm the guy who submitted the edit for the coppermine-T that you reverted.  I can't guarantee ALL BX boards support coppermine-Ts, but there's no question at least the Abit BX-133 RAID does, so it's not accurate to say they are old-core-new-board only as is the impression in the current state.  Their last released BIOS notes explicitly list support for 1GHz Celerons which are definitely Coppermine-Ts: 

http://www.abit.com.tw/page/sa/download/download_bios_detail.php?pFILE_TYPE=Bios&pMAIN;_TYPE=Motherboard&pTITLE;_ON_SCREEN=BX133-RAID&pSOCKET;_TYPE=Socket%20370

Also, on this forum there's an excerpt from someone who's had communication from Abit re: coppermine-T support (you have to scroll down, no direct link): 

http://www.abxzone.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-6817.html

i'm pasting it here:

I think the PIII 1200mhz you guys are seeing is not a Tualatin but a faster PIII called the CopperMine-T.

Check this thread at anandtech:

Link (http://forums.anandtech.com/messageview.cfm?catid=28&threadid;=512647) 

There is a post from RichieZZZZ there and he posted:

you need to read HOCP they e-mailed abit about it.

<< There is and has been confusion about what exactly Tualatin CPUs will work in as we stated earlier. It seems as if Tualatin CPUs are not backwards compatible with BX or i815 chipsets. When I posted this earlier I got this mail from Don Goff that pointed us to this link which we had posted a month or so ago that states this, """"Supports Intel Coppermine T CPU."""" about their BIOS upgrade for the ABIT BX133 RAID board. Admittedly I am a bit confused about this too so we asked ABIT what exactly the deal is and here is their response. 

Kyle,

OK, I have it. It is the confusion about CopperMine CPU vs. CopperMine-T CPU vs. Tualatin CPU.

The CopperMine-T was the CPU that was the bridge between the CopperMine and Tualatin platforms. The CopperMine-T can work in BX boards, usually through a BIOS update. 

The Tualatin CPU has a different pinout and simply will not work in a BX board. I have confirmed this with our R&D; and FAE so have to believe that this time it is true.

City of Vancouver or Greater Vancouver Area?

The classification box should read """"City of Vancouver"""" instead of simply """"Vancouver"""" since it appears to be the Wikipedia standard to use the """"official"""" name of any country, nation-state, American state, etc. in such classification boxes.  Further, I notice alot of articles about Vancouver's neighbouring municipalities that do not mention the official names of such municipalities.  Why simply say """"Delta"""" when one should be saying """"The Incorporation of Delta"""" when the government website of that municipality uses such as a legalistic title? I know that lawyers are the only type of people who really care about municipal boundaries and official names, but this is still Wikipedia and all the technical and legalistic details should be mentioned.  After all, municipalities, whether a city, town, township, village, etc., are merely creations of the law of incorporation.

I was wondering if any person living in the Greater Vancouver Area had a hand in writing this article because there is lack of distinction being made between the City of Vancouver (i.e. Vancouver proper) and the surrounding municipalities such as the City of Burnaby, City of Richmond, etc.  Until the Greater Vancouver Area undergoes the type of municipal amalgamations as seen in the Toronto, Ottawa and Hamilton areas, this important distinction must be made.  This article should not use the simple word """"Vancouver"""" to mean the larger metro area that includes Burnaby, Richmond, etc.  Doing so would be very confusing to a reader in view of the Greater Vancouver Area map with all those municipal boundaries drawn in.

 ******* Double Standard Against Bosniaks *********** 

ChrisO doesn't want me to use copy of the original investigative article that was published in 1993 by David Bernstein (Pacific News Service). The reason is because he thinks this is a personal website http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/english/general_lewis_mackenzie.html . What difference does it make? It's still original article published 13 years ago by Pacific News Service with full copyright notice? http://www.geocities.com/famous_bosniaks/english/general_lewis_mackenzie.html

On the other hand - he allows use of personal """"lists"""" or """"groups"""", such as """"mail-archive"""" and Serb-run """"balkanpeace"""" from Toronto when reading articles republished from Canada's Globe and Mail, example http://www.mail-archive.com/serbian_way@antic.org/msg00008.html

Anyways, balkanpeace.org is Serb-run website in which Bosniaks, Croats and other ethnic groups are portrayed as the worst of the worst, while Serb crimes are excused.

One more thing - if I stop being active here, then you will know that they banned me. And if that happens, it will be clear example of pro-Serb one-sidedness and double-standard that is attempting to plague this very important article http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srebrenica_massacre .

I urge ChrisO to protect Srebrenica Massacre article in a same way Israel's article is protected http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Israel .

And remember: Srebrenica massacre article is not about Serbs or pro-Serb lobbyists such as General Lewis Mackenzie. Srebrenica massacre article is about 8,000+ victims of genocide. Let's focus on the victims and honor them.

How would you feel if you lost your children, mother, grandmother, grandfather and all people that you loved and lived for? Ask yourself this question every time you edit Srebrenica massacre article. Search for love and compassion in your heart, you will find it.

Peace! Always! Forever!

Hello Woohookitty,

User Ecemaml has told us to ask you for help with a problem me and a number of users, including Ecemaml, have had with the article on Gibraltar. Perhaps you could provide some form of arbitration. There is no particular dispute at this moment although over the past few months, user Gibnews has imposed his POV version of the article on the vast majority of users. Other opinions backed with acceptable sources are dismissed by him as pro-Spanish. He also seems to convey a sense of irrational hostility towards Spain and Spaniards which are reflected in his edits. If you check the history of the talk page, he has driven away a number of users over the past few months. He is now engaged in disputes regarding articles on """"San Roque"""" and """"Algeciras"""" (cities close to the British territory of Gibraltar.) Permanently banned user """"Gibraltarian"""" has recently returned to support him as an unregistered user signing as """"yanito"""". On the other side of the debate, the only user showing a (Pro Spanish POV) tendentious and aggressive behaviour is User Ismael76, although he seems to have got bored of the issue and left the debate.

I was wondering if you could give us some advice on what we should do with Gibnews and the article in general. It is sad when users appropriate articles as their own to express their POVs.

Would it be possible to suggest that religion (according to Cicero, from Latin  re- """"again"""" + legere """"read"""") is a human survival strategy which allows those within to co-operate in securing their future - sometimes at the expense of their neighbors' survival. 

Hence th prohibition about killing and the 'just war' philosophy. It is significant that the scriptural (i.e. written) Judaic origin of the world and the garden of Eden is closely linked to the time and place (Ur was around Basra in modern Iraq) where writing was invented. The peripatetic Jewish nation  invaded Palestine (land of the Philistines) after, and their holy writings record much of this.

It's structurally very hard to get any significant change implemented. If you put a lot of work in you may eventually succeed, but it'll probably take a lot longer than you'd think. One example is the Article Wizard - this took about 2 years from gestation to completing its implementation. And that doesn't really challenge anyone's power, does it? This sort of structural inertia is why I created Wikipedia:Village pump (idea lab), to at least try and have a space where ideas don't get shot down so quickly. Bottom line, the difficulty of changing the governance is not unique - though it's clearly a special case of being even harder. The only solution is to keep trying to come up with new ideas. PS The problem is not so much being given the tools indefinitely; the processes for removal of tools where that's clearly warranted are not so bad. The difficulty is in handling low and mid-level problems, and a certain tendency from people who've heard Wolf cried too many times to dismiss any problems short of """"desysop now"""" seriousness as either bellyaching from troublemakers or just minor stuff of the """"everyone makes mistakes"""" variety.

|Usage of """"Creation Myth"""" is clearly in line with this policy. The policy states """"Wikipedia articles on history and religion draw from a religion's sacred texts as well as from modern archaeological, historical, and scientific sources."""" The latter three almost unanimously use the term """"Creation Myth"""" while the first describes it as a historical fact (which we cannot due for a myriad of reasons that I'm sure everyone reading this understands). 
|At best if any reliable sources can be found that are critical of usage of the term """"Creation Myth"""" (not myth as a stand alone since the Electoral College can not be classified as a College any more than definitions of myth, particularly the informal/colloquial definitions can be applied to the term """"Creation Myth"""") a section disucssing this criticism should be added to the article and the main Creation Myth article but shouldn't contradict usage of the term per """"Some adherents of a religion might object to a critical historical treatment of their own faith because in their view such analysis discriminates against their religious beliefs. Their point of view must be mentioned if it can be documented by notable, reliable sources, yet note that there is no contradiction."""" 
|Per the section that states """"Several words that have very specific meanings in studies of religion have different meanings in less formal contexts, e.g. fundamentalism and mythology. Wikipedia articles about religious topics should take care to use these words only in their formal senses in order to avoid causing unnecessary offense or misleading the reader."""" editors of this article have, in good faith, created a FAQ, cited formal definitions, wikilinked to the main Creation myth article (which also has a detailed formal definition) and added a footnote to the the term """"Creation Myth"""" to further clarify formal usage. All of which meet and possibly exceed the due diligence required to ensure that the formal meaning is understood. 
|*WP:UCN 
|Usage of """"Creation Myth"""" in the title has been furthermore contested after the first article RM, another RM was started about a week later to remove the term from the title, that RM also was declined and closed (albeit with some arguement and complaint regarding it possibly being closed too soon). UCN tells us """"Articles are normally titled using the most common English-language name of the subject of the article. In determining what this name is, we follow the usage of reliable sources, such as those used as references for the article"""", considering the vast majority of cited sources including archaelogical, scientific, historical and other scholarly/academic writings use the term """"Creation Myth"""" as opposed to other colloquial variants the title meets UCN. 
|Furthermore the usage of """"Creation Myth"""" abounds in reliable sources doing a quick google search shows that it's use clearly meets the """"common usage"""" section of UCN """"Common usage in reliable sources is preferred to technically correct but rarer forms, whether the official name, the scientific name, the birth name, the original name or the trademarked name"""" 
UCN also tells us """"Where articles have descriptive titles, they are neutrally worded. A descriptive article title should describe the subject without passing judgment, implicitly or explicitly, on the subject. """" alternatives such as """"Story"""" or """"account"""" imply value judgements regarding veracity one way or the other (Story commonly being defined as fiction, account commonly being used in factual / historical context). Additionally changing the name causes a loss of precision (also discussed in UCN) since """"Creation Myth"""" is the formally defined academic term and as such doesn't allow for any ambiguity (only one definition) whereas other alternatives do.

 Do not build straw men. I haven't said EJ is not a reliable source.

Discussion
I prefer to act transparently. Can I give my views on that determination here?  insignis 
 I sent you an email message asking for your opinion. I think that is pretty transparent.   
 That is fine with me, but some editors don't like it. It was a neutral invitation to a discussion, but it would be more open on a talk page - I did have the wikibreak sign up though. Thanks for the message though, I didn't notice the discussion start.  insignis 
 I wrote it in an email message when possible because those kinds of notification are not worth writing on user talk pages – since there is nothing to talk about. However, in two cases the users' had no email listed and in those cases I did write it on their talk page. See User_talk:Sarsaparilla#Review_of_deletion_of_page_User:Prester_John and User_talk:Christopher_Mann_McKay#User:Prester_John. I did not know that policy you linked to. Thanks for that.   
That is a good point, no reply is necessary. By the way, it is not a policy, rather a 'behavioural guideline' - I hope it is helpful. Regards,  insignis

Hello again. I'll respond to your note on my page a little here. First of all, I don't have a negative attitude towards the Romans, or the Greeks, or the Macedonians or anyone from Western antiquity. I'm really not that interested in Classical history beyond basic knowledge. What I AM interested in is keeping the wiki clean.

As far as having the article locked, it was put into what's called """"semi-protected"""" mode. In semi-protect, anonymous users cannot edit the article, and neither can newly  registered accounts. This is to prevent vandalism from occuring - people putting in nonsense or swearing for no reason, that kind of thing. By the time you read this note you should have had your account long enough that you can now edit the article. I will warn you that trying to put in uncited material or stuff that goes against the manual of style will probably be deleted again, although not by me.

Another suggestion would be to use the Apollo discussion page to air your concerns. Two of the five wikiprojects that have staked a claim on Apollo ( Wikiproject Classical Greece and Rome and  Wikiproject Mythology) are known for their accuracy and attention to detail. They can probably give you reasons for why the content looks like it does. 

One last note, if you want to leave me a message again, please to it here at this link to my talk page, rather than on my main user page.

 Facts 

I think I'm finally starting to get the hang of this Finding of Fact malarkey, Brad.

The scenario: Bishonen has been focusing her energies for the last few weeks on her attempt to get an editor called Nina Green banned from Wikipedia. When Bishonen realises that Nina Green is indeed going to be banned

She posts to the arbcom page in green text: FoF perfectly normal. Arbcom pages are like little rainbows.
At the end of a talk page post about the green text, Bishonen suddenly decides to refer to it as """"dye"""":  FoF Not at all forced or contrived. Lots of people refer to text as dye. Or if they don't, they should do.
Bishonen ends her post with  """"Green dye!"""" which reads as """"Green die!"""": Fof Pure coincidence. Nina Green couldn't have been further from Bishonen's mind when she wrote """"Green dye!"""". Bishonen hadn't though of Nina Green for at least 30 seconds.

FOF: This entire sequence events: Bishonen wants Nina banned, gets what she wants, posts in green text, decides to call text """"dye"""", and ends her post for no apparent reason with """"Green dye!"""" is just a random bubble of billion-to-one-coincidence. Bishonen could just have easily chosen blue text, and it would have made perfect sense to end her post with """"Blue Pigment!"""".

Even so, that does not imply that: Mexico could not possibly use any """"generous financial support"""" to buy the arms, ammunition, or other war supplies for the very reason that the U.S. was the only sizable arms manufacturer in the Americas. To make matters worse, Germany could not be counted on to supply Mexico with war supplies directly, as the British Royal Navy controlled the Atlantic shipping lanes.

As the editor 148.247.186.142 has pointed out, Mexico could buy weapons produced in Argentina, or use the Argentinian companies as intermediaries. Moreover, as the same editor also pointed out, the 75% of the fuel used by the British Royal Navy in 1917 was produced in Mexico. Hence, without fuel the British Royal Navy could not control the Atlantic shipping lanes at all. Actually, it is not a coincidence that the UK took Persia in the partition of the Ottoman empire of 1918, considering the fact that the Anglo-Persian oil company was founded there in 1908; and the UK had learnt the lesson: it is really dangerous to depend exclusively on the oil produced in only one foreign country. Well, they learnt the lesson until the oil crisis of 1973. Finally, let us also recall that the US made plans in 1917-1918 for invading Mexico and taking control of Tampico oil fields, but the US also calculated that Mexicans would set in fire the oil fields before they could arrive there; the classical scorched earth technique applied by the Russians against Napoleon and Hitler.

 Extra help with article writing 

Hi , I thought I'd drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o)

First of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, staring with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to follow.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.

Second, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: user:/Sandbox, that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.

For your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along (I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of my own hand-picked mentors () when I came back to Wikipedia after a long break.)

Here's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.  Remember to save your page often! You don't want to lose your work.

Hopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you.
How references work

 Simple references 

These require two parts;

a)
Chzz is 98 years old. """"The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 

He likes tea.  [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website] 

b) A section called """"References"""" with the special code """"{{reflist}}"""";
== References ==
{{reflist}}

(an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections)

To see the result of that, please look at user:chzz/demo/simpleref. Edit it, and check the code; perhaps make a test page of your own, such as user:/reftest and try it out.

 Named references 

Chzz was born in 1837. 
""""The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 
 

Chzz lives in Footown.

Note that the second usage has a / (and no closing ref tag). This needs a reference section as above; please see user:chzz/demo/namedref to see the result.

 Citation templates 

You can put anything you like between  and , but using citation templates makes for a neat, consistent look;

Chzz has 37 Olympic medals.  {{Citation
 | last = Smith
 | first = John
 | title = Olympic medal winners of the 20th century
 | publication-date = 2001
 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]
 | page = 125
 | isbn = 0-521-37169-4
}}


Please see user:chzz/demo/citeref to see the result.

A Nursing Model – Hildegard E. Peplau from Townsend, M. Essentials of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing: Concepts of Care in Evidence-Based Practice. Chapter 1, 25-28. 6 ed. F.A. Davis Company. Philadelphia. 2014.

The referenced literature presents the Nursing Model of Peplau is based on an interpersonal theory structured on the nurse-client relationship development. Peplau created the Psychological tasks as a learning process which nurses could help their patients achieve personal maturity, since their illnesses have been caused by breaks or failed development during this process. The four Psychological tasks are learning to control others, learning to delay satisfaction, identifying oneself, and developing skills in participation. These stages are classified by age, childhood, following concepts developed by Freud and Sullivan. There are some important understandings about Peplau’s nursing model: Nursing is a human relationship, Psychodynamic nursing is a tool to oneself and other-selves development, and Rules are social establishments important to keep functional the social structure. As an example of nursing rules Peplau define social actors as a stranger, resource person, counselor, teacher, leader, technical expert and surrogate. These actors have an important function to improve the relationship between nurse and patient. The nursing-client relationship is oriented by four phases, Orientation, Identification, Exploitation and Resolution. The Peplau’s model provides the nurse as a facilitator of the process of the client development, where the professional - armed with the rules and techniques – interacts through relationship with the client to achieve a missed learning and maturing process.

3fe4393addcc62f4,"This page is dedicated to the Gnome Owl.
MEASUREMENTS: The Northern Pygmy-Owl has a body length of 7 - 8 inches, a wingspan of 15 - 16 inches, and weighs about 2 - 2 1/2 ounces.  
HABITAT: This owl can be found at forest edges near meadows, lakes, coastline, and forest clearings in deciduous and coniferous forests of western North and Central America.  
DIET: The main diet of the Northern Pygmy-Owl is small birds and rodents, and large insects. Occasionally, they will eat reptiles and amphibians. Pygmy-owls are diurnal(active during the day) and crepuscular (active at dusk and dawn) hunters. This owl will search for prey from a perch, pouncing upon it from a close distance when prey is found. 
REPRODUCTION: The Northern Pygmy-Owl nests in tree cavities. The female usually lays 3 - 5 eggs. Unlike most owls, which start incubating the eggs soon after the first eggs are laid, the pygmy-owl does not start incubation until all the eggs have been laid. In about 29 days all the chicks hatch within a short time of each other. The young owlets fledge at 30 days and are independent of parental care 20 - 30 days later. The young owls become sexually mature in less than a year.  
NAME DERIVATION: The scientific name comes from the Greek words glaux, indicating a little owl; glaukidion, meaning to gleam or glare, and may refer to the eyes of the owl; and gnoma, referring to knowledge, reasoning, or an opinion. The common name indicates the size of the bird and its northern range. This owl has also been called a Gnome Owl. 
INTERESTING FACTS: 
Unlike hawks, falcons, and eagles, owls do not have an expandable part of the esophagus, called a crop, to store extra food. Therefore owls, like pygmy-owls, will cache the remainder of their food in a hiding place and eat it later. This is especially important for small, high-energy species that must eat frequently.

Since pygmy-owls are active during daylight, they rely on their sense of sight to hunt. Consequently, this owl did not develop a good sense of hearing, silent flight, nor exceptional night vision, like nocturnal owls.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 AndyTheGrump, Is THE REFERENCED AND PUBLISHED Decision of EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS (ECtHR) not a PUBLISHED RELIABLE Source? Notice that I am giving the ECtHR reference DIRECTLY from OFFICIAL ECtHR website. 212.174.38.3   

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

That is why the discussion of 1915 Events cannot be continued objectively. One of the sides (Armenians) do not want to hear any counter thoughts let alone to see a counter writing in such a FREE Wikipedia environment! 212.174.38.3

Hi, Quaranj
Just curious why you think material in Wikipedia is """"leading to death threats and other hate-crime related events""""? The material is widely proliferated - a quick Google search turns up hundreds of pages, including references in SPIN, CMJ, and Vibe magazines.  Having the material here would seem to be minor compared to those nationally published magazines.
Furthermore, if Jordana wishes to have the material removed, there is a process she can follow to have that done. If you are not she, then you are going against consensus by removing the properly sourced material.

If people want to find out about her they will have to find other means. Wiki is to provide a base of verifiable data. So long as people don't arbitrarily remove information that's fine. There doesn't appear to be anyone else willing either to discuss POV concerns or to update the information. In the past when I have vandals have just removed everything. People can find out more by other means but there's a lot of rubbish posted on the Web and one false reference still on Wiki which I leave just to confirm the lazy still quote Wiki when they haven't done their homework. The only thing I'd keep for now are her trial dates. But that will soon end.

If Abtract and Sesshomaru want to work informally to Abtracts formula (and Collectonian notes Abtracts areas of interests), then it simply means they don't report each other.

This sounds like a bit of a stupid question, but presumably if we start using a lot of wind energy, then we are slowing down the movement and circulation of air in the atmosphere.  How are we able to determine what the long term impact of this is?  Recall that people expressing concerns about polluting the air and causing climate change were ridiculed when first proposed.  How do we know that broad-based use of wind-based power generation won't have dire long-term consequences?  (Those consequences to seem like they would be rapidly reversible, however.)

Presumably a similar argument could be made about geothermal exhausting the heat within the Earth, causing the tectonic action to cease, but that seems a lot further off than wind-based power generation having an impact.

As a Wikipedia, I am aware of the three main guidelines for editing articles about living people and feel I have not strayed from them in my editing of the article about Paul Offit. 

On Neutral Point of View:

 I was merely stating the conflict of interest of the """"studies"""" done by the committee affiliated with the AAP claiming that the Rotateq vaccine was safe when the very academy this committee is a part of takes bribes from the very corporation that manufactures the vaccine, Merck. Clearly, these people who receive hundred-thousand dollar contributions from vaccine makers are completely unreliable on topics such as vaccine safety. Studies allegedly confirming the safety of a product should never be considered reliant if done by those who would profit off them.Besides, 89 patients have been given the vaccine and died. This along with the conflict of interest done by those who claimed the vaccine was """"safe"""" shows that there is no reliable evidence that rotateq is safe. 

Verifiability: 

I provided valid links, 1 to Medalerts describing the adverse effects where Rotateq was administered and the patient died. 88 of such cases can be found on the website. The second to CBS news in which Sharyl Atkisson reveals hundred thousand-dollar contributions taken by the AAP from pharmaceutical corporations such as Merck and Wyeth.For deaths associated with Rotateq: 

http://www.medalerts.org/vaersdb/findfield.php?LOWAGE=&HIGHAGE;=&VAX;=ROTHB5&SEX;=&VAXCNT;=&STATE;=&VAXMAN;=&VAX;_DATE_LOW=&VAX;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXLOT;=&ONSET;_DATE_LOW=&ONSET;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXDOSE;=&SUB;_DATE_LOW=&SUB;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXROUTE;=&REPORT;_DATE_LOW=&REPORT;_DATE_HIGH=&VAXSITE;=&L;_THREAT=&PRIOR;_VAX=&ER;_VISIT=&CUR;_ILL=&HOSPITAL;=&HISTORY;=&X;_STAY=&SYMPTOMS;=&RECOVD;=&LAB;_DATA=&DISABLE;=&OTHER;_MEDS=&DIED;=Yes&V;_ADMINBY=&DEATH;_DATE_LOW=&DEATH;_DATE_HIGH=&V;_FUNDBY=&PAGENO;=1&action;=Find&PERPAGE;=10&SORTING;=NONE For conflict of interest within AAP: 

http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/25/cbsnews_investigates/main4296175.shtml 

Original Research:

 This is not original research as nothing added made any definitive claims beyond what was stated in the sources. The fact that infant patients who were administered the vaccine, including a set of twins died after receiving it and that the evidence provided attempting to show the vaccine is safe was essentially done by an organization tied in with the vaccine manufacturer shows that there is no reliable proof that the vaccine is safe. 

Despite my keeping within the Wikipedia guidelines, I was repeatedly blocked by User:MastCell, my citations deleted. Some were on the excuse of """"libelous,"""" but they were all factually verifiable, and had cited sources. So then I wrote in these same facts again and along with how User:MastCell is acting as a minion of Paul Offit by censoring all negative information about him however true and violating Wikipedia's guidelines as a responsible administrator. Angered, he has blocked me indefinitely for """"personal attacks,"""" when I merely wrote them in response to his own abuse of power by censoring anything negative albeit factual about Paul Offit as """"libelous."""" Ironically, MastCell violates all of the above. His verifiability for stating Rotateq is safe comes from a Merck-funded Association, his neutrality is limited to the point of censoring any negative information about Paul Offit that is verifiable, correct and unobjective, his original research comes from drawing the erroneous conclusion that Rotateq is safe on the basis of """"studies"""" essentially funded and determined by the drug's own manufacturers. Therefore, I appeal to nullify my week-long blocking. I would also suggest blocking User:MastCell as he has actually violated Wikipedia Terms of Use himself, especially since he holds the responsibility as an administrator, the basis on which he has used to block me.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I think that it is important to mention national syndicalism at the beginning, as that eliminates a good amount of the problems with temporality associated with some of the more generalizing and overarching terms that have been suggested.
As for the left-right thing, it should be apparent that national syndicalism itself was a nationalistic movement, but the economics they embraced were not generally what would be considered """"right wing"""". I agree that it is problematic to harmonize all of the elements, but the next paragraph focuses on the right wing stuff (i.e., totalitariansm, etc.), and the third paragraph delves into the economics ideology. Neither of those is contradictory to the lead. Fascism arose during a fragmentary, transitional period, and it ideology embraced what today may seem to be contradictory elements. It's probably better to try and get that across earlywhich the reference to """"national syndicalism"""" should facilitate, than oversimplify.
Regarding the deleted material, I think there are some claims made there that would have to be sourced and attributed or based on a substantial body of text in the main article that provided context (and sourcing). It should be borne in mind that the WWII-era fascist states of Italy and Germany along with the then quasi-fascist Japan formed the """"axis"""", for example, so the claim of xenophobia seems somewhat specious to me, though ethnocentrism sounds plausible. Just because it sounds plausible, however, does not mean that there are RS describing it as such. Militarism is a common thread, but how does monumental architecture relate to that?

This page is redirected from russian peasant multiplication, but a google search for the exact phrase russian:peasant:multiplication scores 570 and peasant:multiplication only 689. To me this implies that it is nearly 5 times as likely to be refered to as russian peasant multiplication in english. Moving the page is not really worth while, but a recognition of the alternative name in the text seems to make sense to me.

On the subject of the proposed merge with ancient egyptian multiplication, the two techniques, while relying on the same fundemental mathematical principal, are very different in practice. These multiplication schemes are specifically about practice, not theory. The people that use/used these techniques use them empirically.

ddd6af18901ec6d5,"Holby series/characters 

Hi there,
I know you've been doing a fair bit of contributing to the various Holby City series and character pages recently. I see you've been adding various wards after character's names and job titles, though I think it's got to a point where the lists are tending to look a little cluttered. As the editor who added the character lists to the individual series pages in the first place, the intention was to only include the ward that each characters usually appeared on - the one they were resident on - rather than just the wards that they popped up on from time to time. As such, this is why I've been keeping characters such as Guy Self and Colette Sheward in the list without a ward, as they do not appear to be formally allocated to a particular ward. Where there have been multiple wards listed, this has been due to the characters moving between wards over the course of the series, such as recently when Ric Griffin and Michael Spence swapped roles on Keller and AAU, respectively, during Series 15, hence their listing there as Keller/AAU and AAU/Keller. 
As such, I'm proposing, for brevity's sake, as well as for clarity, that the wards listed be kept to a minimum - each character's principal ward only, rather than any that they occasionally appear on (for argument's sake, pretty much all characters appear on AAU from time to time, but that doesn't mean they should have AAU listed after their names). The alternative is that we do away completely with having characters' wards listed after their names.
I've reverted the list to its former appearance, in the process removing a couple of things (Dominic isn't on AAU, Edward (who, incidentally, left the show in Episode 13, and has been removed from the opening titles and the BBC website) wasn't on Keller, and Nathan and Mr Thompson were never given allocated named wards). 
Let me know what you think - it may be that the complete removal of wards may be the easiest way forward!",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello, I was wondering if you would be willing to assist with the GA Sweeps process. We are currently looking over all of the GAs passed before August 2007 and determining if they still meet the criteria. After beginning with 2,808 articles we are now down to less than 900. Last month we had rapid progress, clearing over 300 articles. You've done a great job with the GA process, and with your contributions to so many GANs, I believe you would be a great reviewer for Sweeps. We are trying to complete the process in the next few months, and the best way to meet that goal is to have as many experienced reviewers as possible. I've given up reviewing GANs until this process is over, but you are under no obligation to do so. If you're interested in reviewing some articles, even if its only a few, it would be greatly appreciated. Instructions can be seen here. If you have any questions, let me know. Happy editing!

Well, I'm sorry, but I don't have those links that you desire. Yes, this article is very POV based, in favour of vangard propaganda sociology. Unfortunately, due to the tyrannical trends of namby pamby liberalism (Labour UK, for example), not much genuine research can be done in the subject, because it's quite politically incorrect these days. For example, when a university professor says that on average Black people score lower in IQ tests than white people, said professor gets voted out of tenure 600 to 1. So it's not good practice for libertarian capitalists to bother trying to counter argue against all this namby pamby left wing crap. Labour UK is a twisted experiment, which, although capitalist and ostensibly right wing, has introduced very bizarre left wing projects in to the political playing field: such as, teaching young children about homosexuality in schools, trying to make gay hate a crime like race hate, trying to make condemnation of monotheistic religions a crime, with use of the truth distorting term 'incitement to religious hatred' etc. We are on the losing side, those of us who love truth. Left wing politics can be just as dirty and obfuscatory as right wing politics. - CaptainSurrey""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Basically: because someone put the steam measurements in doubt, Francesco Celani asked directly to the measurer, i.e. chemist dr Gilberto Galantini, if the measurement regarding steam were made with the appropriate devices, how was the steam, etc.
Galantini answered to Celani, and Celani published the statement made by Galantini i.e. the steam measurer.
Therefore there is no doubt at all from Francesco Celani about the sutability and satisfatoriness of the measurements.

But, in general, there is also some ambiguity between tensors and pseudotensors (or between even and odd) when it comes to integrands.  An example in one dimension, when  and  is:

The first integral is equal to either of the other two integrals.  In the second integral the integrand transforms like a tensor (or odd tensor) density, but the integration limits are no longer from lower to higher; in a higher-dimensional example they would be no longer right-handed.  In the second integral the integrand transforms like a pseudotensor (or even tensor) density because we have kept the integration limits in proper order, −b < −a; in higher dimensions we would say that we are maintaining right-handedness.  The usual convention I've seen is to keep the coordinates right-handed and to transform the integrand as a pseudotensor density, but the other approach is equally valid.  — (talk | contribs) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Lumdeloo, if we used Glen's Autobiography as a general source, it would rule out much of the """"Country"""" genre; I believe he stated that he doesn't believe himself to be a Country performer. There are quotes on the back of certain CD reissues where Glen dismisses the Country genre as well. As a musician myself, I'd argue most of his output was Folk; there was no sixties Pop sound, IMO. You could easily label the albums as Pop, but sixties pop versus seventies pop versus eighties pop versus nineties pop are all different. For instance, one may consider Hall and Oates """"Rich Girl"""" to be a Pop song, but the Bigger Than Both of Us album has several genres; mostly Rock.

Not sure where to put this, so I'll put it here. Tomorrow I'll take a peek at places like the Village Pump, the Help Desk, or perhaps the editorial council page thingy that I saw somewhere and see if I should post my query there.

I've noticed that a subject I've done some contributing to is lacking its own article. Cable television red-links to digital telephone service. General Communications, Inc. red-links to digital cable telephony (I created that one).

If I were king of the world, I would create an article called digital telephony and make both of the above-mentioned red-links redirects to it. Or perhaps I would create a disambiguation page that links to digital cable telephony, digital fiber-optic telephony, VoIP and other similar articles (some of which don't exist yet.

Alas, I might be king of the world — or at least have editing power in the Wikipedia — but I don't have the time or knowledge to create an entire article about it. What should be done? Should I (or someone else) create a stub and redirect both?

I'm just afraid that someone will create an article under one entry but it won't be tied together with another entry, and there will forever be a dichotomy...or at worst parallel universes in which information is not shared between related subjects.

Are my fears unfounded? Should I just leave it be and let it evolve on its own?

 JFK """"invited"""" Glenn to explain delays? 

This dubious footnote was just added:
""""...a frustrated politician compared the spacecraft-Atlas combination to """"a Rube Goldberg device on top of a plumber's nightmare"""" and John Glenn was invited to the White House to explain the delays.""""

This New Ocean verifies the senator's remark, but makes it clear that JFK, while disappointed like everyone else, believed NASA knew best what was required to make the flight with reasonable safety, and describes Glenn's February visit (incidental to his visiting family in Virginia) as """"a brief visit with President Kennedy, who asked him many semitechnical questions about plans and systems for the orbital flight"""" (citing several newspaper reports), but says nothing at all about Kennedy demanding Glenn """"explain delays"""".

First, that the topic in question is not necessarily bound to an adherence to the concept of self-reported identity, and that to do so is unencyclopaedic. Second, that it is absurd to assert the logical invalidity of all other definitions of the word """"man"""" but that based on self-reported identity.

I agree that the example is conceptually difficult. My view is that a range of interally consistent interpretations of that situation are possible, such that the choice betweeen these arguments cannot be made on a strictly logical basis. The arguments must admit of some strictly non-deductive premises (adductive, inductive etc.) It should be clear then that I'm certainly not advocating a """"definitive, binary and absolute"""" definition of """"man"""". And my reference to Wittgenstein is based upon his fundamental recognition that any word is a """"social construct""""; indeed it is precisely because of this that Wittgenstein argues that nothing that is exclusively self-defined (such as his example of the 'beetle' in the box) can have meaning.

 To conclude, whilst there legitimate arguments for doing so, we don't have to """"wade into the mud"""" of self-identity, and basic encylopaedic principles demand that.

 On recent edits regarding English section 

I have reverted some edits by Capnprep.  I'll address a few of his concerns:

1.  Do as aspectual auxiliary.  This is the only function of DO as an auxiliary verb and is its primary function within the language.  The non-durational aspects in English (everything not progressive/continuous aspects) are marked by the aspectual auxiliary DO followed by its subordinate in bare form.  English has two aspectual auxiliaries, DO & BE.

2.  Do is not a modal auxiliary.  It does not express emphasis / emphatic mood.  Rather, DO when used as an aspectual auxiliary may be emphasized just like any other word in a sentence.  There is no emphatic modal auxiliary in English.  English simply uses vocal stress (or in type, boldface or ALL CAPS) to emphasize the desired element.

3.  Perfection / perfecting auxiliary is valid.  Perfect is not an aspect but rather a verb in any aspect may be perfected.  Perfection is a grammatical category used to express completeness of a verb.

4. I have changed the repeated phrasing """"Most auxiliaries"""" / """"Most modals"""" to ...some... because this sort of generalisation is simply untrue and unfounded.  If anything, of the modal auxiliaries, those that subordinate to infinitive form are at best in approximately 50% distribution to those that do not.

5.  In the discussion of the various forms following make, I have once again removed the claim for passive voice.  That usage is not in passive voice at all as BE is not acting as a vocal auxiliary but rather BE+MADE is acting as a single unit forming a modal auxiliary.  Whereas MAKE as a modal auxiliary conveys internal force and subordinates to bare form, BE+MADE expresses external force and subordinates to infinitive form.

6.  Within the section on defective verbs I have eliminated some poor and misleading examples while rewording others.  That section comes close to conflating infintives with infinitive form and as worded was misleading.

Please do not revert any of these changes without first addressing and resolving these points here on the talk page.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 YouTube videos are not considered reliable, as anyone can upload a video and make a claim.

For the hacking incident, the only way for it to be mentioned here is through either a reliable source, like a news group, or by the developers itself.

While the blog does mention the eventual shutdown due to """"site issues"""", I doubt it'll be enough to be added to the article, since one who's new to Roblox and reading the page would believe it was just for routine maintenance, when it was much worse; David Baszucki didn't say exactly what the cause was, which - in the case of the videos - was various hackings, it seems, and you can't add in details that the source doesn't provide.

Wikipedia is/was a fantastic resource that is now experiencing an exodus of wonderful contributors for a plethora of reasons and is having it's content distributed across the web for profit due to ridiculous policies. What made this project great was people challenging the norm and saying 'hey, this is how things are done, but lets try it this way...'. What's killing this project is good-meaning yet damaging editors following the rules and saying 'hey, this is how things are done'. I'm not a great editor, not even a very good one, I sort of stumbled my way through WP leaving a trail of destruction and fuck-ups as I went, but I always generally meant well and being reprimanded for reverting an obvious vandal epitomises what is wrong with WP now. I used to edit pretty heavily, especially vandal-fighting, but for the past six months or so haven't seen the point because, although the vandals are damaging, the policies and regular editors are down-right lethal. HJ Mitchel was, in my honest opinion, a cunt to do what he did (people can make up their own mind exactly what that was), I'm not saying he is a cunt of a person but as a WP editor/contributor/admin, possibly through no fault of his own but by the fault of the rules, policies and guidelines that he follows. I don't want people berating me for what I've just typed, or congratulating me, I've spent enough time on WP to know that people will be willing to do both (admittedly moreso in a more public forum) and even more will simply think their opinions the response to this rant will be so WP-standard I shan't even bother checking. talk to me """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi, I'd tried to rewrite a section relate to Japan, but my English is quite limited. So could someone help to rewrite an article?

My suggestion is about Japanese streetname of the drug. 'Shabu' is a street name which is used by Yakuza, that name was not popular before ban of the drug. Before methamphetamine ban, 'Philopon' (ヒロポン) was the most popular name. 'Philopon' is a trademark of Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma (http://www.ds-pharma.co.jp/), former Dainippon Pharma (大日本製薬). And there are ads of Philopon which was sold over the counter (http://www.warbirds.jp/heiki/42000.htm).

Methamphetamine is the still number one illigal hard drug in Japan. Most common street name is 'speed' or 'S', and usually used by smoking. Methamphetamine regulation is very strict and difficult to use for medical purpose. (ADHD is treated with methylphenidate.)",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Preference revelation and revealed preference theory 

I recently created the stub preference revelation to function as an overview of the work that's been done in the area of determining what your preference are.  In this entry it states, """"The search for observables in microeconomics is taken even further by revealed preference theory"""".  Samuelson's theory, while by far the most popular, is just one of several notable theories.  

I also created actions speak louder than words and put your money where your mouth is to highlight the economic significance of those two expressions...but I ran into difficulties with editors who are not very familiar with the area of preference revelation.

 Background section 

At the present time, the """"background"""" section cites unspecified interviews with the media, according to which, Ahmed claimed to """"take apart a clock and rebuild it inside a pencil case.""""

The sentence is taken verbatim from the NPR article. However, it links to a Dallas News article, which says no such thing, to a Dallas News interview, which also does not contain this statement, and mentions a WFAA interview, which I've been unable to find. I've checked four different interviews with Ahmed and he does not explicitly describe it as a rebuilt clock in any of them.

If such an interview exists and the statement was not an interpolation by NPR, it would be nice to have a direct link, a quote and a date.

The problem with the statement is that it provides inadequate background for the rest of the article. When the story broke on 9/15, the device was consistently described by the media as """"a homemade clock"""" or """"an invention"""".  The fact that it was a reassembled commercial clock was mentioned in passing by a WFAA article (which quoted Irving police) on 9/16 but otherwise mostly ignored. It only went """"viral"""", so to speak, when Dawkins waded into the controversy on 9/20 and his comments got picked up by the conservative media.

Much of the immediate reaction, from Obama's tweet and Zuckerberg's invitation to Dawkins' lashing out, seems inexplicable if the device in question was acknowledged to be a rebuilt commercial clock from day 1, but makes sense if the device was initially assumed by everyone to be a genuine homemade clock.

Bismillah any foundation presupposes faith in it.  To be neutral since Wikipedia rejected-refused to admit the purity of Islam even so much on the issue of pictures of Muhammad by obscurantism for anybody can take a cultural-archeological find from syncretism and be incorrect in their interpretation when it is outside the framework of custom then logically it must either delete in totality the reference on Muhammad or the position of neutrality of Wikipedia. One deliberate misrepresentation of Muhammad in word or fact is your seated choice in the domain with its range of fire.  On Islam any is free to express that history in point and counterpoint.

a9c08f9e565f6e45,"Agreed. The term ‘blastocyst’ appears to be based on a false distinction that has been drawn between ‘the embryo proper’ and the embryo at an earlier stage of development, sometimes the term ‘pre-embryo’ is used in this context. However the precise stage at which an embryo can be classified as a ‘blastocyst’ or a 'pre-embryo' seems to involve a somewhat subjective judgement. The article currently says:
      
A blastocyst is a stage of development of an embryo when it is around five days old and made up of about 100 cells.

Because of their highly subjective nature, terms such as bastocyst and pre-embryo are problematic and may be criticised for trying to dehumanize the human embryo.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I am a current student at fort st and agree completely with what you are saying. Ms moxham especially. She has gone completely overboard (especially with this recent uniform push) and is turning our school into a dictatorship! I recently went to state music camp and several of the students going asked for extentions on their assignments, which according to ms moxham was unacceptable, that she was unaware so many fortians were going on the camp and said that so many of us should have the oppertunity was unfair to other schools! Shouldn't she have been proud that we all got in (30 of us)?! Then she started going on about how she only knew about the camp one day before we went on it, even though she PERSONALLY signed every single one of the forms!!

This is a false claim with the following counter-example:

The United States no longer sees horse-carriages that have been replaced by the automobile.  The increased production of the automobile reduced the production of the horse-carriage implying that Pareto efficiency never existed or could never exist, because it cannot account for all things including future technology that greatly improved the efficiency of all things by the automobile (the United State production capability after adjusting for inflation and other economic factors from 1950 to 1990 and the automobile and resulting highways was just one technology influence of this).

 Texas Tech seal images 

I note that you reverted my replacement of Image:TTU Seal.svg, Image:TTUS Seal.svg and Image:TTUHSC Seal.svg with Image:Texas Tech CoA.png in their respective articles.  The reason I replaced them was twofold:

First of all, it simply seems to me that, at least for the TTU and TTUHSC articles (not so sure about TTUS) the Coat of Arms would more accurately reflect the overall visual identity of the institutions in question; according to the visual identity guidelines at , """"[t]he Official Seal and Signature are [...] reserved for use by the Office of the President of Texas Tech University and are used to represent the official business of the university"""", whereas the academic Coat of Arms is intended as a """"unified identity for all academic entities within the Texas Tech University System"""".  Using the Coat of Arms instead of the seals in our articles would also seem to reduce the (admittedly small) chance of them being mistaken for official documents of the university, and complies with the advice (which, while we are not bound by it under fair use, it would seem courteous for use to follow) that """"[t]he Official Seal and Official Signature may be used only for documents and publications that represent official business of Texas Tech University"""" and that """"[d]ocuments that are not official and formal should use the appropriate Academic Signature"""" (i.e. the Coat of Arms).  It also allows us to use a single image for all the articles, not to mention, in my opinion at least, showing the interesting part of the logo more clearly without the distracting border and text around it.

The second, and more significant, reason for the replacement, however, was that, while I'd originally uploaded those SVG seal images in good faith, believing them to be acceptable with U.S. fair use law as well as our policies, upon further reflection I'm not longer as convinced of this as I was.  In particular, while there are reasons for arguing that the SVG versions are not too detailed to pass criterion 3(b), especially given that they're freely available from the TTU web site anyway, I now feel that, regardless of the acceptability of their absolute level of detail, they are nonetheless replaceable by less detailed bitmap images, and therefore fail the non-free content criterion 3(a).

Thus, I no longer believe those images are appropriate for Wikipedia, and do not want myself to be associated with them.  As their uploader, I have the right to delete them; the reason I chose to tag them as orphan instead of deleting them directly is that I wanted to keep them around for a while, in case someone did object to the change, and did not want others to end up tagging them (and warning me about it) while they were there.  That said, I still don't want them to stay around forever with my name in the upload log; if you want to, despite the issues I outlined above, you're free to reupload them (or bitmap versions of them) under a different title, thereby assuming the responsibility of asserting their compliance under our policies and U.S. law.  I no longer want that responsibility.

Oh, and regarding the use of the TTUHSC seal at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso Campus, I'm pretty sure that blatantly violates our non-free content criterion 8.  It's not like that article really needs (either of) the images, anyway.  —  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Debut March 18, 2000[3] 
Randal """"Randy"""" Keith Orton[4][5] (born on April 1, 1980)[2] is an American professional wrestler currently signed to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) wrestling on its Raw brand.[6] Orton is a third-generation professional wrestler; his grandfather Bob Orton, Sr., father """"Cowboy"""" Bob Orton, as well as his uncle Barry O, all competed in the professional wrestling industry.[7]

Before being promoted to the main WWE roster, Orton trained in and wrestled for Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association-Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling for a month. He was then sent to Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW). There, Orton became OVW Hardcore Champion on two separate occasions.[8]

After signing with WWE, Orton became a member of the stable Evolution, which quickly led to him capturing his first title with the company.[9] Orton also acquired the moniker """"Legend Killer"""" during a storyline where he began disrespecting Hall of Famers and physically attacking veterans of professional wrestling outside of appropriate restrictions.[1] In 2004, Orton became the youngest World Heavyweight Champion, when he won the title at the age of twenty-four.[10] His title win resulted in his departure from Evolution and feud with his former stablemates. In 2006, Orton joined forces with Edge in a tag team known as Rated-RKO. As a team, Orton and Edge held the World Tag Team Championship.[11] After the team disbanded, Orton, during the fall of 2007, won the WWE Championship twice in one night.[6]

Early life
Orton was born on April 1, 1980 in Knoxville, Tennessee.[2] Son to Elaine and """"Cowboy"""" Bob Orton,[12] he is the eldest of two siblings—Becky and Nathan.[13] Knowing from experience the hardships of life as a professional wrestler, Orton's parents tried to convince him to stay away from wrestling, and his father warned him that life in the ring meant a life on the road, away from family.[1] Orton attended Hazelwood Central High School, where he was an amateur wrestler.[1] After graduating from Hazelwood in 1998,[5] Orton enlisted with the United States Marine Corps. There, he was dishonorably discharged a year later, after going AWOL on two separate occasions and disobeying an order from a commanding officer.[14] Under the Uniform Code of Military Justice, Private First Class Orton was tried and convicted under a special court-martial and was put into a military prison for thirty-eight days.[12]

Career

Wrestling training
Orton first made his professional wrestling debut in 2000 with Mid-Missouri Wrestling Association-Southern Illinois Conference Wrestling (MMWA-SICW) in St. Louis, Missouri, an organization that was an off-shoot of the old St. Louis Wrestling Club headed by Sam Muchnick.[3] There, he was trained by both the promotion and his father, Cowboy Bob Orton.[12] During this time, Orton performed in matches with wrestlers such as Ace Strange and Mark Bland.[3][15] He worked at MMWA-SICW for a month.[15] Orton then refereed a few matches with World Organized Wrestling, a promotion where his uncle Barry Orton worked.[16] In 2001, Orton signed a deal with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) and was sent to their farm territory, Ohio Valley Wrestling (OVW) in Louisville, Kentucky, where he continued his training. During his time in OVW, Orton wrestled the likes of Rico Constantino and The Prototype and teamed with Bobby Eaton during a tag team title tournament. He won the OVW Hardcore Champion on two separate occasions by defeating Mr. Black on February 14, 2001 and Flash Flanagan on May 5, 2001.[8]

 WikiMarkup 

Wikipedia has it's own special """"language"""" called """"WikiMarkup"""". It is very important, therefore, to know a good deal of it when you begin to write an article.

 Links 
 External links 
An external link is a link that goes to another website, besides Wikipedia. They are formatted like this: [Name of website goes here].
For example: [http://www.google.com] becomes . 
To display alternate text for an external link, type [Name of website goes here Alternate text goes here]. Note the space between the website's name and the alternate text.
For example: [http://www.google.com Google search engine] becomes Google search engine.

 Internal links 
An internal link is a link that links to any page within Wikipedia. They are formatted like this:[[Name of page goes here]]
For example: [[Giraffe]] becomes Giraffe.
An internal link can display alternate text through the use of a pipe character """"|""""
For example: [[Giraffe|A long-necked animal that lives on the plains of Africa]]. becomes A long-necked animal that lives on the plains of Africa.
Normal text can also be blended into a link.
For example: I like [[Giraffe]]s. becomes I like Giraffes.
Internal links can link across namespaces.
For example: [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]] becomes Wikipedia:Neutral point of view.
They can also use Pipe tricks.
For example: [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|]] (note the pipe character before the two end brackets) becomes Neutral point of view
For example: [[Orange (fruit)|]] becomes Orange.

 Redirects 

A redirect is a page that, if accessed, sends you to a related page automagically. For an example of this, see Gill net. Note how at the top of the page it says (Redirected from Gill net). Voila!
For example: #REDIRECT [[United States]] redirects whatever page it was on to United States.

Either Birmingham is the UK's most populous city or it isn't. Urban Area, conurbation, metropolitan area, city-region could all be used to present the facts as they are. London is not a city, as it does not have city status (that would be the City of London). There's no point having articles saying it is, then others that it isn't.  |  Talk   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I'm fine with not describing Aders """"hop' as flight. I only added Ader because he was before Vuia, and is generally agrreed to have hopped farther than Vuia hopped in 1906. I assume from your use of quotes that you probably agree that there is a general consensus that Ader got off the ground in 1890, (but not in his later craft) and that his all to brief sojourn in the air was basically uncontrolled and unsustained. If this is the case, how would you feel about aknowledging his """"hop"""" of 50 meters at minimal altitude?

 Why will Gwen Gale not read the sources? 

On 01:27, 5 August 2010 I posted a section on """"Talk: Death of Adolf Hitler"""" titled “Random Questions” which started “I am not a scholar, I read Wiki but would not think of editing it. But I was disappointed in this article, and many points in the discussion, so I am asking some questions. Perhaps someone else will read and address them.” The section went on with several rethoritical questions, and ended with “As to sources, the last books I have read are The Murder of Adolph Hitler by Hugh Thomas (sort of shaky) and The Last Days of Hitler by Anton Joachimsthaler (English translation, I buy much of this).”

Gwen Gale was apparently assigned me as an administrator, because at  she replied with: ”As the article lead says,...This said, this talk page isn't a forum for talking about personal views or questions on a topic, it's meant for talking about sources and how to echo them in the text. I say this because the article seems to already cover, with thorough citations, most if not all of what you've brought up...dodgy. Gwen Gale (talk)”

By this reply it appears that Gwen Gale is NOT FAMILIAR with the work of Joachimsthaler, who I have just referenced, and thinks that I am asking a personal question, not a rhetorical one. At that time I apologized, tried to explain myself, and restate my questions.

At  I posted” If I had read Kershaw's Nemesis Chapter 17 note 156 and Epilogue note 1 I wouldn't have wasted your time. You can't get much clearer than that. Should be required reading. Perhaps someone else should read them, and possibly edit the article. Thank you for your time.99.41.251.5 (talk)”

At  I posted “I would like to direct people to the work of Ian Kershaw Hitler, 1939-1945: Nemesis ISBN 0393322521. Chapter 17 and the epilogue relate to this article. Please pay attention to his notes and sources. Be warned, his book Hitler: a Biography is a kind of digest which does not include these resources....The source Joachimsthaler is basically an English translation of a German's analysis of 1950's post-Soviet interviews of bunker survivors. The original transcripts must be available somewhere. There are many other bunker interviews, some with questionable intent, and not all agree. Wm5200 (talk)“

Since those posts I have posted a huge amount on the talk page, virtually all of which Gwen Gale has disputed. Much of the material I have posted I have later deleted, often because I felt that the endless conflict between Gwen Gale and myself is counterproductive to the article.

Anyone who is Wiki can probably bring back any of those posts. Was I sometimes rude and argumentative? Absolutely. Was I making legitimate points which related to the article? I thought so. Did I receive effective support and encouragement by my administrator? I think not, but you judge.

My main point was that Joachimsthaler had reviewed the information, and had made a solid case for positions which Kershaw backed. I repeatedly begged anyone, especially Gwen Gale, to read Joachimsthaler and Kershaw, specifically, two footnotes, I even told the pages of the footnotes. Gwen Gale clearly had not read either source.

 I posted, under the heading “Question for Gwen Gale” , the following: ”I lost you, but I’m confused myself. It appears as though the person with the least information available is most influential on the article.

The U.S. is big on free press, and it works. My very low budget suburb is in a system which serves 225,000 people with 4 MILLION titles (numbers approximate, thanks Carol). That’s on the next shuttle van. Most of the rest of the assets of a state with 12 million people are a couple of days away by mail. The specialty stuff on AE from Radcliffe took maybe a week. And I am an amateur. Dan, you are over three million people higher in the food chain, you must be “world class”. Kierzek has clearly read and analyzed everything, reviewed most of it, and as far as I can tell, every word he says is accurate and informed.

Kershaw, Joachimsthaler, Thomas, Trevor-Roper, Beevor, Shirer, Ryan, Toland, Eberle/Uhl, Lehmann/Carroll, O’Donnell, Victor, Petrova/Watson. (Vinogradov hit a snag, reordered). These are books which I have had in my possession and read parts of since Aug 2010. I can understand if others do not have access to the same resources, but I think that should be addressed. If someone does not have access to two footnotes which are critical in a discussion, that also should be addressed...I know that this is P.O.V., and that I am personally involved.

As I recall, the """"classic 6"""" teams were in a league that operated like a country club. They nearly got caught napping, but they headed off the second-major-league threat by expanding... which of course brought in a bunch of money to the old guard from the entrance fees. Also, they aligned the new teams in a separate division, which essentially made the Stanley Cup finals an exhibition series for the winners of the """"classic 6"""" playoff rounds.

Metalcore is a modern fusion of both hardcore punk and heavy metal. Metalcore is known for its emphasis on breakdowns and heavy guitar riffs. Screamed vocals dominate metalcore. Singing is usually present, but the emphasis is on screamed vocals. A lot of bands that are casually referred to as """"hardcore"""" or """"metal"""" are actually metalcore bands. Metalcore has practically taken over the heavy metal music scene.
Screamo is one specific derivative form of hardcore punk. It has nothing to do with heavy metal. It denotes a fusion of hardcore punk and emo, generally featuring emotional lyrics, transitions from soft to heavy passages, and screamed vocals accompanied by more melodic singing. The word screamo is misused all the time. People often call any music with screaming in it """"screamo"""". But screamo is actually only one specific genre. The genre itself is still very popular. There are lots of modern screamo bands that more-or-less still meet the same basic stylistic requirements of screamo.
Post-hardcore is a direct derivative of hardcore punk (hence the title post-hardcore). It simply defines any modern hardcore punk with high levels of experimentation. I know you didn't ask about this genre, but I felt it appropriate to mention. Post-hardcore represents a very wide range of musical styles. Post-hardcore bands may take influence from many other styles of music, and are often closely associated with alternative rock or punk. What identified post-hardcore, though, is the inclusion of hardcore punk elements like screamed vocals. If a band uses screamed vocals and heavy instrumentation, but is not heavy enough to be considered metalcore, then the band will often be labeled post-hardcore. 90.205.53.223  ericdeaththe2nd90.205.53.223  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

  Excuse me, Logolist, but there's no purpose served by implying obliquely that the Germans of today have designs upon Wroclaw, Szczecin, Gdansk, etc., if that's what you intended above.

Beyond that, you should understand that all these points of view about ex-German places that are part of post-1945 Poland have been made, aired, discussed, contested and reiterated ad nauseum on Wiki during the past couple of years.

My own view is that these places were known to most of the world by their German names for a long time, which should be explained where RELEVANT, i.e. in any historical section. This is especially true of Danzig/Gdansk, given its unique history in the interwar period and internationally high profile politically. A secondary point is that these places where known to their INHABITANTS by their German names before 1945.

There's nothing revanchist or revisionist in naming places with the names by which they were known to the world and to themselves during the historical periods involved. Indeed, it is linguistically revisionist, in a sense, to refer to Danzig (for example) as Gdansk when writing about the six centuries in which it was inhabited mainly by Germans.

I've argued all along that the Germans today should refer to these places by their Polish names when referring to contemporary events – for the same reasons that they should be referred to by their German names when historical events are the issue.

The term Cantonese is the result of poor transliteration in English. Canton is the English word for both Guangdong (province) and Guangzhou (provincial capital of Guangdong). When the word Canton is made into the English adjective Cantonese, it could mean Guangdongese and Guangzhouese. The language people commonly refer to as Cantonese is in fact Guangzhouese. Taishanese people speak Taishanese, a language that is unintelligible with Guangzhouese. Many Taishan people in China still do not speak or understand Guangzhouese. This is the norm in the whole of China concerning regional spoken languages. It is acceptable to say that Taishanese is one of the Guangdongese languages, but then so is Hakka. The conflict is thus not a conflict between a Cantonese (meaning Guangdongese) speaking people against a non-Cantonese speaking people as both peoples spoke Cantonese meaning Guangdongese, be it one spoke Taushanese and the other Hakka. Neither party could also be described as Cantonese (meaning Guangzhouese) speaking people as neither were Guangzhouese speakers at home.

Hi Memlikelmendi. My name is Qwyrxian, and I'm an administrator here at Wikipedia. I wanted to try to explain what happened above in simpler terms. The first, most important thing, is that, as a general rule, you should not try to write an article about yourself. This is because we have found that people with a conflict of interest simply are unable to write good, well-sourced, neutral articles about themselves or organizations they are closely involved with. As such, once you are notable enough, someone will eventually make an article on you. If you really want to try to make an article on yourself, you should try to use the Articles for Creation process, since that will allow another editor to review your work and give suggestions.

The other reason why the article was deleted, which is tied in to what I said above, is that the article was overly promotional. It used excessive, praising language for the composer, which violates WP:NPOV. Moreover, it didn't have any references; to have an article, a subject must have been discussed in detail in multiple, independent, reliable sources.

Agreed.  We really should try to stick to the subject of the article at hand.  And looking through the Jeremy Clarkson article I
see there really isn't a lot about his penchant for speed. It's mentioned, but just briefly, alongside his clean driving 
record. However in searching via Google, I found this article,

http://driving.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,12529-1890873_2,00.html

This to me seems rather striking, to have somebody talking so openly about speed.  Maybe we could change the article around to be,

In spite of his penchant for speed, Clarkson holds a clean driving licence. None the less, he is not especially reluctant to discuss the subject of speed. In a November 2005 article in """"The Sunday Times"""", Mr. Clarkson wrote, while discussing the Bugatti Veyron,
""""On a recent drive across Europe I desperately wanted to reach the top speed but I ran out of road when the needle hit 240mph"""", and later, in the same article, """"From behind the wheel of a Veyron, France is the size of a small coconut. I cannot tell you how fast I crossed it the other day. Because you simply wouldn’t believe me"""".

Could we write that ?

These two quotes are rather remarkable, in my opinion, and worth mentioning in the article.  They demonstrate his honest and frank manner of discussing his travels across Europe. And we could just leave it to the reader to decide if he is talking about going 240mph on public roads, or whatever. I realize you may feel differently about Mr. Clarkson than I do, but none the less, these two quotes do clarify his penchant for speed, and are worth mentioning, alongside his clean driving record, I would say.

You made an obviously bad call about Protonk, a well respected and long term contributor to this project based on what you term a BLP violation. You state in your comments that this was supported by other admins when anyone who takes the time to actually go there and read the comments will see, that no one supported your decision. This caused a moderate admin to leave the project completely only to allow less moderate admins like yourself more room to exert influence. After reviewing the comment Protonk made, I certainly agree it was a bad comment, but it was absolutely not worthy of a block without any sort of warning or talk page message and it was no worse than your outburst of telling all the editors in an RFA they are Fucking morons"""" because you were the submitter of the RFA and likely had your feelings hurt. An event I note that you were not blocked nor even approached about and as far I can find have never openly apologized for. Although there may be a comment somewhere I do admit. 
You have a tendency to exaggerate in your favor such as can be seen in the previous statement when determining that there was support to summarily block Protonk when there clearly was nt. This can also be seen in reviewing some of the cases on your talk page and talk archives.
As mentioned above, and as noted by several individuals, your Fucking morons''' comment is still too new and does not represent the attitude needed or wanted of a functionary.
You recently unblocked  and revoked his topic ban knowing this user had a long history of Personal attacks and trolling regarding gender topics and gamergate. Within 24 hours that user was again blocked for personal attacks, has continued to stir the pot and make drama and has been drug to at least ANI and Arbcom within the last week as can be seen on their talk page and the mentioned venues.
Even based on your comments here, you clearly have an attitude of knowing better than everyone else whats good for Wikipedia. That arrogance is inappropriate of a functionary.
You give a staggering number of over 13000 blocks and claim it as an achievement. Personally, I see this as proof of your tendency to block first and ask questions later.

============

Two aliens landed in the Arizona desert near a gas station that was closed for the night. They approached one of the gas pumps and the younger alien addressed it saying, 'Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Take us to your leader.'

The gas pump, of course, didn't respond.

The younger alien became angry at the lack of response.

The older alien said, 'I'd calm down if I were you.'

The younger alien ignored the warning and repeated his greeting. Again, there was no response.

Annoyed by what he perceived to be the pump's haughty attitude, he drew his ray gun and said impatiently, 'Greetings, Earthling. We come in peace. Do not ignore us this way! Take us to your leader or I will fire!' 

The older alien again warned his comrade saying, 'You probably don't want to do that! I really don't think you should make him mad.'

'Rubbish,' replied the cocky, young alien. He aimed his weapon at the pump and opened fire. There was a huge explosion. A massive fireball roared towards them and blew the younger alien off his feet and deposited him a burnt, smoking mess about 200 yards away in a cactus patch.

Half an hour passed until he finally regained consciousness. Refocusing his three eyes, he straightened his bent antenna, and looked dazedly at the older, wiser alien who was standing over him shaking his big, green head.

'What a ferocious creature!' exclaimed the young, fried alien. 'He damn near killed me! How did you know he was so dangerous?'

The older alien leaned over, placed a friendly feeler on his crispy friend and replied, 'If there's one thing I've learned during my intergalactic travels, you don't want to mess with a guy who can loop his penis over his shoulder and stick it in his ear.'

 Re: Prussian Blue mp3 

If you'd checked the talk page, you'd have seen that I've had a message for you there for a long time regarding the mp3 which I removed, and which you recently reinserted, and which has been removed once again.  Specifically, the mp3 does not have any material regarding Prussian Blue in it.  The interview is between a DJ at KERN radio and an 11 year old girl named """"Ellie Mae"""".  While the mp3 does cover the topic of white nationalism and racism (as the little girl is obviously being coached by her parents on what to say).  No one in the mp3 is identified as being one of the Gaedes, or even a fan of their music.  Prussian Blue and the Gaedes are never mentioned in the mp3.  The mp3 therefore does not support the claim that Prussian Blue are """"just proud of their heritage"""".  Cheers,

>Hello Beaumont,I noticed that you have recently joined the Dzierzon discussion and especially Dzierzon's self-identification. You may want to read his own biography and look at his family photos at [56].
What exactly the autobiography is supposed to prove? That he wrote German. And where he identifies himself as German? And what the photos suppose to proof?
>He himself states that his mother Maria and father Simon had a small farm in the same place in Silesia. In other words they were longtime burghers of Silesia, as well as him.
Yes there was. “Name of his great-grandfather Jerzy (1717-1800) appears in the oldest Polish chronicles of Lowkowitz “(W. Kocowicz 1987).
>You look at the church records with birth, marriage, death from Lowkowitz and surrounding area and all his Dzierzon family members, who all wound up after 1945 in Western Germany and you find no traces at all of either him or his parents having moved from Poland to Silesia, Germany.
It only proof that the official language was German and Germanization was on the way look V. Raczek, Erinnerungeu all den Altmelster der Bienenzuclit Dr. Dzierzon
>His grave stone also identifies him as Johann Dzierzon.
The grave stone is repeatedly mentioned by many as proof. The stone was funded by Austrian Beekeepers’ Association and have nothing to do with Dzierzon’s family will. I already mentioned about it in earlier part of the discussion. Lokk up.
>The only Polish people, who came to the Silesian town, I find reference to, is by the way on the current Polish Kluczbork.. (?) site, which tells us that Protestant Polish people took refuge there in the 1600's. We all know, that the Counter-Reformation and the Jesuits 'convinced' the Silesians and others to re-catholizise. Perhaps that is, where Johann Dzierzon had gotten his surname from.
You like to forgot that orginal population of Silesia was Polish people. Look for “Recoveret Teritories” article. The orginal Polish language survived for hundred od years. (It is not exceptional facts you can found such event on Lithuania and others countries where the native language was not changed in vilages) As you can imagine because the schools were fewer.
>I have not seen any self-description of him by himself as a Pole.
I am not surprised of it. German do not publicized such thinks. You need read Polish. You have editions by Polish authors in English. You can find them in “Literature” sections. Also you disbelieve recent Polish authors but you believe on NSDAP propagandists Karl Fleischer (his editions are 50-70 years old). I ask many times for recent German beekeeping historians who says Jan Dzierzon was German.
>The wikipedia Polish group, lead by A Serafin, who is also Nr. 131.. are the only ones with a note from a 1961 book, which is added to the incorrectly named Jan Dzierzon wikipedia article.
The correct name of Jan Dzierzon is Dzierżon the z is with dot above. “Dzierżyć” means to keep in Polish language. What do you mean a note from 1961. All Polish beekeeping historians says Dzierzon was Polish. You just disregard parts which are inconvenient.
>This not only claims, that he said that, but insisting on, that he actually did say that. Where is the actual proof? 
In Kluczbork museum. There is many more interesting thinks about the Polish Dzierzon family and their testimonies. I will encourage you to find proof of yours statement JD was German. Nobody yet give me one except the NSDAP propagandists Karl Fleischer scribbles. Autobiography do not say anything of such, we already know it, is not? 
>That quote, supposedly from him,'identifying himself as a Polish person', actually just says, that his surname is a Polish-based surname.
The citation say: “Regarding my nationality, I AM obviously, just as my name says, Polish of birth, since on Silesia people speak Polish…” in Polish version is: """"Samo moje nazwisko mówi, żem Polak z urodzenia"""" which is “just my name says I AM Pole of birth” Further the sentence says: “because from 10 birthday I found myself in Breslau and I studied there I become German educated, but the education does not accept borders or nationality.” I did not include the other part before as I avoided irritating Germans chauvinists. Now you have it.
Original Polish text: „Co do mojej narodowości, jestem oczywiście, jak już samo nazwisko moje mówi, Polakiem
z urodzenia, gdyż na Śląsku mówi się po polsku, a że od 10 roku życia znalazłem się we Wrocławiu i tam studiowałem, stałem się Niemcem z wykształcenia. Ale nauka nie uznaje granic ani narodowości.”
Original in Museum of. J. Dzierżona in Kluczborku, sygn. 35, 14, 11 Folge, Zur Charakteristik Dr. J. Dzierzon.
Are you really assume that Prussia was an asylum of tolerance and love? If so you would be surprise. Dzierzon did not have a reason to love Prussia.

Notability of Bree Conden
 A tag has been placed on Bree Conden requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

 Wikilings exposed at http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html  

I had an email exchange with Matt Crypto (the, er, self-proclaimed """"Nobody"""" who admits he knows nothing about the topic being discussed -though he improperly deletes it http://rexcurry.net/wikipedialies.html ), asking him to stop spamming his childish comments and spamming his deletions of my Wikipedia posts and to stop emailing me. (He seems to think that Wikipedia is his whole world and is the entire internet, and it is not. Nice. http://rexcurry.net/wikipedia-lies.html ) Anyway, Matt's only response was to make off-topic childish remarks and  here's the genius part  when Matt's own childish remarks (similar to Matt's reply above) are repeated back to Matt in an effort to show Matt his childishness (and to mock Matt) Matt becomes mad and remains clueless.  I suppose Matt thinks that when he does this, he's done something very clever. Sadly, Matt's debating style is much favoured by schoolchildren: make off-topic childish remarks and stalk accurate writers with his """"nah-nee-nah"""" voice. It is amusing, though, to see Matt (a grown-up?) do it.  Here are the points that Matt never addresses, does not dispute, but always tries to delete so that other wikipedians will not know: 

 1. Dr. Rex Curry showed that the USA's first Pledge used a straight-arm salute and it was the origin of the salute of the monstrous National Socialist German Workers' Party (Nazis). Professor Curry helped to establish that it was not an ancient Roman salute, and that the """"ancient Roman salute"""" is a myth. http://rexcurry.net/pledgesalute.html  

2. The Pledge began with a military salute that then stretched out toward the flag. Historic photographs are at http://rexcurry.net/pledge2.html and at http://rexcurry.net/pledge_military.html   Due to the way that both gestures were used, the military salute led to the Nazi salute. The Nazi salute is an extended military salute. http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-pledge.html

3. Francis Bellamy (author of the """"Pledge of Allegiance"""") and Edward Bellamy (author of the novel """"Looking Backward"""") and Charles Bellamy (author of """"A Moment of Madness"""") were socialists.  Edward and Charles were brothers, and Francis was their cousin. Francis and Edward were both self-proclaimed National Socialists and they supported the """"Nationalism"""" movement in the USA, the """"Nationalist"""" magazine, the """"Nationalist Educational Association,"""" and their dogma of """"military socialism,"""" and Edward inspired the """"Nationalist Party"""" (in the USA) and their dogma influenced socialists in Germany, and the Pledge was the origin of the Nazi salute.  """"Nazi"""" means """"National Socialist German Workers' Party."""" A mnemonic device is the swastika. Although the swastika was an ancient symbol, Professor Curry discovered that it was also used sometimes by German National Socialists to represent """"S"""" letters for their """"socialism.""""  Hitler altered his own signature to use the same stylized """"S"""" letter for """"socialist"""" and similar alphabetic symbolism still shows on Volkswagens.  http://rexcurry.net/book1a1contents-swastika.html

Dr. Curry showed that many modern myths about swastikas rely on a false belief that Nazis called their symbol a """"swastika.""""  German National Socialists did not use the word """"swastika,"""" but called their symbol a """"Hakenkreuz.""""

Ethnic Malays
This edit war is getting a little tiring. You added a lot of references to support your claim """"and to some degree Javanese culture; however it differs by being more overtly Islamic than the Javanese culture"""". Yes, it is true they are similar to """"some degree"""". But you could also say that Malays are similar to """"some degree"""" with many other Austronesian cultures, of which there are thousands. If you look at the language classification  the Malay language and Javanese have over 1000 languages in the same language group. Out of those, the Malay language is in fact closer to many other languages such as Ibanic, Kendayan, Balinese, Madurese & Sundanese than it is to Javanese. So why have you mentioned Javanese specifically and not one of those other 1000 cultures, especially those which are more closely linked to Malay culture? You can of course find elements of one culture which have been adopted by another culture, but does that make them similar enough to mention? Its like saying American and Japanese culture is similar since they both like to play baseball. You could just as correctly say that Malays and Thais are similar """"to some degree"""". The second part of the claim """"however it differs by being more overtly Islamic than the Javanese culture"""" is wrong since it implies that religion is the only, or even the main differentiating factor. This is total nonsense.

In my opinion, you're confusing different policies. You say that everything you write there is sourced; for the sake of the argument, I shan't dispute that (even though a very good point is raised there, regarding the difference between sourced and attributed). However, sourcing is required to comply with Wikipedia's policy on verifiability. Soapboxing, advocating and giving undue weight, on the contrary, are not permitted under Wikipedia's policy on neutrality. So, even if everything you state there is sourced, it still can't be included if it violates WP:NPOV.
It's not a matter of not liking what sources have to say; it's just that they are only opinions. I don't think criticism should be hidden or Amanda's guilt taken for granted. Actually, I don't even know if she did it, because, quite frankly, I never studied the case, but I'm convinced that if a Court of law convicted her, there must have been sufficient evidence to warrant that. Italy's not Soviet Russia... My point is that the article shouldn't mainly revolve around criticism of the trial or attempts at soiling Guede's reputation, by implying that he was a lone killer, as that, primarily, violates WP:BLP. Wikipedia is not there to retry Amanda. As I've said, I agree that criticism should be reported; it is notable and rather easily sourced. However, that should not be the focus of the article. 
Finally, as I wrote on the article's page, technically the trial record is publicly avalaible, but that doesn't mean that it was actually accessed or published (even in Italian, for that matters)...   ''''''  Let's talk 'bout it! """,0,0,0,0,0,0

This has very striking similarities to the Energia system, the concept of using a space shuttle system's hardware for launching other things isn't unique. There are obvious differences too, like stretching out everything and making it taller, whereas the Energia just uses multiple generic strap-ons, and the main engines were always on the bottom of the big tank for the Buran, so in the sls they have to move them across. 

I'm surprised it's not in the see also section, or used to provide some context for the article's subject. Of course I have no idea if anyone notable has commented on it, but for these kinds of inclusions, nothing is required.   ☏ """,0,0,0,0,0,0

""""CAUSES""""

Some of my current [QUESTIONS] about this important section, which I don't understand........YET WHICH I'VE TRIED TO EDIT.....

QUOTE:
Several mechanisms have been proposed where warmth builds up in the equatorial area, then is dispersed to higher latitudes {NORTH?] y an El Niño event. [WHAT MECHANISMS? HOW IS BUILD-UP AND DISPERSAL RELEVANT??]

The cooler area [WHERE IS THAT?] then has to """"recharge"""" warmth for several years before another event can take place.[citation needed]

The Madden-Julian Oscillation is not a cause of the phenomena, but propagates eastward around the global tropics with a cycle on the order of 30-60 days, and may significantly influence the speed of development and intensity of El Niño and La Niña. 2.

Tropical cyclones north and south of the equator that may play a role in ENSO are caused by the westerly flow between the areas of low pressure induced by a Madden-Julian oscillation.[4] [WHAT DOES THIS MEAN??]

Such wind may counteract the typical easterly flows across the Pacific and create a tendency toward continuing the eastward motion.[citation needed] [A COUNTERACTION OF EASTERLY FLOWS CREATES TENDENCY TOWARD EASTWARD MOTION??]

Eastward-propagating oceanic Kelvin waves can be produced by Madden-Julian activity, which may in turn be influenced by a developing El Niño, leading to a positive feedback.[5] [HOW IS THIS PRODUCED, HOW IS THIS INFLUENCED?}

9aed835e81b3a24c,"That's a difficult question.  I think a lot of it is a matter of just doing it on a day-to-day basis in every discussion we have on WP, whether on an article talk page, a deletion discussion, or at VP.  Maybe there could be a guideline (or even just an essay) urging people not to rely on rote policy citation regurgitation in lieu of substantive explanation (maybe there already is one somewhere?).  And reminding people that citing policy is at best only half the work: you may have settled on what you think governs the issue, but you still need to convince others of the best way to apply it in a particular circumstance.  To do it properly the focus should always be on what the best editorial decision is, not just the superficial level of what complies with codified policy or guidelines.  Yeah, all that should be written down somewhere if it isn't already.  In another guideline for people to cite.  ; )

I think also we could go policy by policy, guideline by guideline, and ask ourselves whether its purpose is clear.  What does it substantively accomplish.  That may not always be evident; it may reflect the way consensus tends to go without an articulate reason as to why.  A history of how the policy was written could be interesting, but maybe not that helpful, and it would be difficult to summarize.  Just looking at the edit history of a particular policy or guideline may omit a lot of developmental discussions that occurred on the talk pages of other policies, the Village pump, or even user talk pages.

Hi Btphelps - The most important thing in any article on a historical person, whether it is for Wikipedia or an old-fashioned encyclopedia, is accuracy. That accuracy goes beyond just the facts and dates that are presented, and goes on to include any photographic images that are purported to be the individual in question. Recently someone who signs off as OSMOND PHILLIPS has been adding a large group of what are clearly phony photos represented as Wild West historical figures to articles on Wyatt Earp, John Clum, Bat Masterson, Mysterious Dave Mather, Luke Short and Billy the Kid - among others. This OSMOND PHILLIPS cites Robert G. McCubbin, the noted Wild West photo authority and collector, as being someone similar to how this OSMOND PHILLIPS would like to be viewed. What makes this interesting is that my longtime friend Bob McCubbin would be the very first to tell you that the entire collection submitted by OSMOND PHILLIPS, to various Wikipedia articles, are NOT the people they are represented as - without exception. Bob McCubbin allowed me to use a photo of Ben Thompson for a book of mine that was published back in 1982. Bob McCubbin also provided additional photos for my 2015 biography (co-authored with Chuck Parsons) The Notorious Luke Short: Sporting Man of the Wild West.
OSMOND PHILIPS would like to portray me as someone who is not qualified to judge a phony photo alleged to be a figure from the Wild West. Well, those who are familiar with my non-fiction books and articles  know that I have had a 
concurrent career as an artist - a portrait artist. These portraits are noted for their photographic realism. Examples of my portraits were given in my series """"Gunfighters of the Real West,"""" a series of 50 articles that appeared in Real West between January 1978 and December 1985. Other examples of my portrait work of Wild West figures (always based upon authenticated photos of Wild West figures) can be found in each of my seven books. The fact is that you don't have to be an esteemed photo collected, like Bob McCubbin, or a portrait artist/Wild West historian, like myself to identify these photos from OSMOND PHILLIPS as fakes. Anyone off the street should be able to do it - it each and every case - by being shown an authenticated photo of the Wild West person in question when placed side-by-side with one of the OSMOND PHILLIPS photos. So why does OSMOND PHILLIPS do this? I think that individual has provided the answer by claiming that they have some kind of TV show coming up on """"National Geographic and Discovery."""" You want to talk about a """"conflict of interest."""" This person isn't interested in promoting a accurate information (or photos) for Wikipedia - but is very interested in promoting a TV show, and undoubtedly sales of these fake photos to gullible buyers.

I think time will show which one of us has the best interest of Wikipedia at heart. On one side you have an individual peppering Wikipedia articles on Wild West figures with photos that have no provenance - beyond their unsupported say so. Most photos from that era of the photos that have been submitted bear a photographers imprint, or logo, along with the place that  the photo was taken. The photos submitted by OSMOND PHILLIPS most likely have these logos with the photographers address - but don't expect to see them any time soon. On, my side you have a historian and artist who has authored books that have Forewords by noted Wild West historians such as Joseph G. Rosa, Leon Metz and Rick Miller. I have also co-authored a book with Robert K. DeArment (considered by many to be the greatest of all living Wild West historians) and, more recently, Chuck Parsons also a noted Wild West historian and author. I stand on my credentials. This happens to be my 40th year being involved in Wild West history. During that time my reputation for honest and accuracy has been a constant. On those occasions when I've found some errors in my earlier work, I have made every attempt to correct it. I stand on my record - and I use my real name ... which is probably something OSMOND PHILLIPS can't claim.

On a final note I am very disappointed it what just happened to my updates that were being written for the existing article on Billy the Kid. I spent a lot of time on this, trying to provide a lot of missing information that other historians and students of the subject would have benefited from. Well, someone decided to revert to a previous version which not only obliterated just about all of my work, but restored the phony photos by OSMOND PHILLIPS. I challenge anyone, particularly those with an interest in Billy the Kid, to take a look at my version (which was still a work in progress, that I was planning on getting to conform to the Wikipedia format and style) and compare it to what you have now. The person who reverted this claimed that my version was """"unreadable."""" I ask anyone, without an agenda,",0,0,0,0,0,0

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

One of the main complaints is that these methods are untested, so I would first and foremost like to test them against real accounts on RFCU—before the ip check results are posted.  If I can establish a good track record there, then it should engender some confidence that these methods are reliable.

One way to do this is by making a battery of tests. When most of the tests do or do not suggest socking, I would post predictions. Over time, it should be possible to determine which tests are most strongly correlated with sock puppets among different classes of socks—and there are at least two classes: regular and proxy socks.

The May 2012 timetable brought a reduction in the stopping service between Marylebone and High Wycombe/Princes Risborough, with the result that stations such as Denham currently only have one train per hour in each direction off-peak, where previously they had two. In the midst of the mid- and long-distance service improvements as are already mentioned in the article, I feel this ought to be commented upon. At the time I thought it was a temporary measure and that the ultimate aim was to improve the suburban service (longer platforms, higher frequency, stops at both South Ruislip and West Ruislip, trains with faster acceleration – in short, something approaching an Overground-style service), but, as of May 2014, that hasn't happened and despite all the excitement about the Mainline service to Birmingham, the service has worsened significantly for the short-distance user. 92.40.248.181",0,0,0,0,0,0

cbc571a4d480898d,"I am blocked for making personal attack, i wonder what are these  , , , , last one is an abuse. the statement in question was in response to a threat by the same user, Renee, , which was noted as something which could escalate into legal threat by another user here , my response that the concern person appears to be mentally unstable  or a paid member of the group, was based on my short discussion with her, about a topic, i noticed that she did not wanted any information to be presented on wikipedia, about that particular group, taking help from admins who have declared their WP:COI .

Other user's also noted that Renee's approach is threating . My stand is not restricted to any particular group or person, but my concern is more about the direction wikipedia is moving into, as noted before, the talk page of the concern topic is now deleted, my objection remains same, there was a link on that page, which pointed towards previously deleted article and i noticed comments from 4 member's only, one was user:Jossi who has admitted that he is on pay role of prem rawat second was from User:Bksimonb who works in PR team of brahma Kumari, both of these user's have admitted their direct involvement with the respective groups, third person was User:Reneeholle, fourth user was Don. Renee has not admitted her paid involvement with this particular group, but her edit behavior clearly showed the same, Moreover there is NOT A SINGLE NOTE FROM ME ON HER TALK PAGE as i simply ignored her threating messages, which were moving more towards legal threat, as noted by more then one wikipedia editor.

I suspect her paid involvement with the group, while we were working on a temp page, about the subject, (on advice of another admin User:Will_Beback), and there one statement was made that there is dispute between two groups, and reference given was court docket, (which was taken as it is, from wikipedia's french twin of the subject). She removed the dispute section from temp page and stated that judgment is in favor of one party, and reference given was some blog !! Giving reference  of a blog, after removing a court docket from a temp page, indicates some problem, or something fishy. This heavy biasing and attempt to reduce information from wikipedia is harmful for future prospectives of wikipedia project, As the talk page which i am referring to has already been deleted, so there is no trace of that particular discussion left, if this tendency of curbing information from paid member's of corresponding groups is not checked, it may lead wikipedia into a wrong direction, or may be in that direction which is not intended.

My direct involvement with article's is bare minimum, mostly i am on talk pages, discussing the matter and letting informed people make the edits once it is agreed. Regarding calling a group a cult, is something which is based in WP:RS if there is a reliable source which refers a group as cult, I write honestly that the group is cult, as per this particular WP:RS and hence respective member's are referred to as cult member's.

I did not filed any personal attack request at notice board, for all the abuses made against me, for the simple reason that i believe that editor's are free to make comments whatever they feel is appropriate, even for abuses that were placed at either my user page or talk page, i have never taken the matter beyond placing the link for the same. 

But I am surprise to see that a comment in response to statement made on my talk page, by another user, about first user, can tantamount to personal attack, given the fact, when it is made for a genuine concern that the said thread appears to be legal in nature.

 In Response to gren's Comments on Zeno's Edits of the POW Section 
 recently commented on my edits in another section . I will address them here.

 if you are going to make large changes on controversial articles it is, as you say, necessary to discuss them and come to a concensus.  No such thing happened with Zeno's edits and for lack of time I reverted to the less horrible version.""""  

, it's not true that I have not discussed my edits. Nor have I made a large change to the article - I have concentrating on one sub-section of the article, and I have concentrated on a small number of facts regarding the treatment of POWs: i.e. the facts that they may be executed, enslaved for labor or sex, ransomed, or freed. These four options in Islamic law concerning POWs are well-known amongst academics and scholars, as my sources have proven. So my edits have not been making any large structural changes to the article, I have concentrated on one sub-section and have elaborated on these four facts. And, as I said, I did discuss these edits, contrary to your allegation. I had been discussing the POW section for several days before I made my recent edit. On July 19, you made this allegation that I have not discussed my edits to the POW section. The truth is that I started discussing the POW section 10 days ago, on July 10, when I started the section Talk:Jihad#Heraclius.27_Mass_Reversion_War. The issue was subsequently discussed in three lengthy sections of this discussion page, before you made this allegation. I had been discussing the POW section here for 10 days, and yet you said that I did not discuss it at all. This is therefore a false allegation on your part. Please follow the discussion page more closely if you are going to talk about who has been discussing what and since when.

 Once you are at wikiepdia for long enough you tool will probably get sick of the same type of narrow-sighted edits that continually happen by new users.  

I'm not sure who or what you are talking about. If you believe that my edit on the POW section was narrow-sighted, then please explain why - enlighten us with your apparently wide-sighted perspective.
 
 """"Maybe this is just me but it seems that ahistorical apologetics are much less dangerous than wholescale demonization and editting articles to say """"Islam says X thing that modern western society doesn't accept. Clearly, neither are very good ways to write an article but the latter has more of an agenda and is usually from the type that end up calling Zora or dab or I Muslims.""""  

Again, I am not sure who or what you are talking about. I certainly have not denounced anyone's views just because they are Muslims. On the contrary, I have said before that I wish there were more Muslims editing this article so that a wider Muslim view could represented than the one that is currently represented by the """"ahistorical apologetics"""" as you call them. 

Having said that, I strongly disagree with your opinion that no one on Wikipedia should describe any Islamic practices or laws that modern society Western does not accept. We must inevitably discuss what """"Islam says"""" about various subjects. We must report the objective facts about traditional Islamic beliefs, in a neutral fashion. Neutrality does not mean that if some traditional belief disagrees with the values of modern Western society then it must be not be mentioned. You seem to be advocating ahistorical apologetics over neutral and objective facts. You have not disproven any of my claims about POWs and Islam, but you have insisted that these objective facts are somehow """"dangerous."""" As for your allegations of """"wholesale demonization,"""" they are unwarrented. The way that Islam treats prisoners of war is completely in line with the norms of the medieval era, during which these practicies were codified. It is a fact of life that Islamic beliefs are deeply rooted in the past, and as a result they are sometimes in disagreement with modern, secular humanist values. If you were truly neutral about this subject, then you would not object to the reporting of facts just because the demonstrate a disagreement between traditional Islam and modern, secular humanist values.  It would be the pinnacle of POV pushing if the article were nothing more than ahistorical appolgetics that ommit any and all facts which demonstrate that traditional Islam is at odds with modern secular humanism.

Reviewer: Hello, dear Derild! You might remember me from MOTD. This is a nice article, simply written, informative, and readable. ) I've done a quick see-through, though, and found a few okay, nitpicky, merciless person that I am, a bunch of concerns. Here they are!  talk 
 Seekers follows four young bear cubs: Kallik (a polar bear), Lusa (a black bear), Ujurak (a small grizzly bear who can change into any animal), and Toklo (a grizzly bear). I think """"...follows the adventures of..."""" might sound better.
 Dogs were considered but rejected because they were too close to cats in their hierarchal social organization, their pack and hunting lifestyles, and their territoriality. <""""their"""" is unnecessary in its second and third usage.
 The company wanted her to write another series on animals just not about cats. This sounds slightly awkward, maybe a comma or two will make it flow more smoothly.
 HarperCollins suggested dogs, but Holmes """"was reluctant...they guard their territories"""".. Direct quotes need direct references. The statement about HarperCollins suggesting dogs especially needs a reference because it's referred to in the introduction.
 """"the all-action excitement that the Erins love so much"""". Same here.
 the company then thought about horses knowing how Holmes also like them.. This sentence sounds a bit awkward, too (there's something grammatically incorrect in that sentence, methinks, but unfortunately, I'm too dumb to lay my finger on it myself).
 ...the main inspiration for the series is Inuit beliefs and the Native American languages The great grammar mystery..again.
 Lusa means black in Choctaw while Kallik means lightning or storm in Inuit.[2] Shouldn't Choctaw be linked to Choctaw language?
 However, even there, Ujurak, who leads the journey feels that they need to go further, into the Arctic. I think a comma after """"journey"""" might make the prose smoother.
 Seekers follows four young bear cubs: Kallik (a polar bear), Lusa (a black bear), Ujurak (a small grizzly bear who can change into any animal), and Toklo (a grizzly bear). Here, a serial comma is used, while in other examples such as Lusa, Kallik and Toklo and The Last Wilderness, Fire in the Sky and Spirits in the Stars. the extra comma is omitted. Either can be used, but it has to be consistent throughout the article.
 The """"First Series"""" section could be expanded quite a lot, I think (especially since the books don't get articles of their own yet).
 Children's Literature picked up the environmental theme, it also commented themes such as """"commented on"""" is probably better.
 approach - three bears mdash;, mdash;, otherwise you crash..
 """"She also cleverly deals with the theme of racism through a unique and honest approach - three bears of different color, different backgrounds and different beliefs turn to each other for survival and friendship""""
 Kirkus Review  thought """"Hunter creates a richly sensuous world filled with cruelty, beauty, tenderness, savagery and just enough underlying legendary background to add mystery""""; they also wrote that too much detail went into developing the characters and setting and there was very little plot.[7] At first they're complimenting the book, and then they're """"also"""" criticizing it.

22 March 2006

Dear Mr Freeman

I am writing to thank you for your letter of 21 March and hope to hear future feedback on our tumble dryers.

I wish to express my utter apology for the poor standard of our tumble dryers that you recently have received. I assure you that the fault was not of the manufacturers, but of the transport company that we hire to deliver our products. The tumble dryers left our company in perfect condition, and therefore were not properly packaged into the lorries and were damaged in the journey. As for the colour schemes, we are to believe that the tumble dryers were being delivered along side some cans of paint and must have got mixed up along the way.

We will have a word with the delivery company to sort out the problem and so future deliveries should arrive in the high standard expected of our company.

In the meantime might we interest you in some exclusive discount vouchers on future orders. Find enclosed our brochure.

Your Sincerely

N Thorpe

Joseph Stalin
My text wasn't edited, it was reversed.  I was trying to improve the article by removing POV and making neater summaries.  
Look further back at my edit history and you'll see my edits were heavy rewrites to flimsy sections, not reverts done to annoy people.  Also, nobody else has really done anything substantial for this article for quite some time.  In the months I've been working on it, other writers have only been adding snippets or links.  
So... if I added extensive justifications to my edits, they might pass?  People complain that this article is biased, and I'm trying to FIX that.  Also, I replaced the lead image of Stalin with a photograph, but Tocino thinks the previous painting is better.  A painting, especially a flattering one made for propaganda, is inferior to an actual photograph, especially on as sharp as the one I've put in (you can even see his pockmarks).  

Hello
I have made sure that I have not violated the 3RR rule because I have been suspended for this in the past. I have waited patiently for a day to pass before I could add the better, more famous image of Stalin (which was on the article before Kurzon came along). Unfortunately, Kurzon has taken a different tactic and in the past couple of hours he has reverted three times without an edit summary to two different editors.

 Query about an """"official page"""" 

Hi Mikaey, 
Yesterday I attempted to post a page on here on behalf of an organisation for which I am currently working as an intern (FDC). Only problem was that we have a specific and official way of saying things which happens to be that of the website and several primary, so I just referenced there. In your review you stated """"We cannot accept copyrighted content taken from web sites or printed sources."""" There are several similar non-profit organisations which have pages on Wikipedia with their official statements published too, I was just wondering if copyright still applies when you are the authorised party? Is there any way I can have this article published without changing the words away from our official statement? Also if I just change the words briefly so it is different from the website but still conveys the message of our organisational profile can it then be published? 
Any help would be much appreciated as I am pretty stuck with where to go on this.
Thank you so much in advance
  

The user here is talking about this page from the AfC queue.  I declined it because at least one section (About the FDC) seemed to be a word-for-word copy from their website.  Notwithstanding any other issues with this article, would someone like to weigh in on the issue of the text's copyright status?  If the organization agrees to let the text be published under the GFDL, would he be good?  Thanks,   
If the organization releases the text as GFDL through an OTRS email, there should be no problem with the """"copyrights""""; but the article as a whole has too much WP:COI and how they wrote their phone numbers and email addresses looks spamy. The article dosen't say anything about notability of the company either. Oh you were asking only about copyrights..sorry. An OTRS email would be sufficient.

Sad that some editors jumped to conclusions without reading or analyzing the article or using the proper AfD process, but I recognize that there is a lot of emotion these days. It took over an hour to build the article but seconds were spent to kill it.

First I carefully reviewed (again) the BLP policies so I could carefully follow them. Than I used the Article Creation Template (or whatever its called) with it's step by step questions. The result of those questions was to create the article. I also check that there are no conflicting articles.  The less than ideal article name is because there is a completely unrelated http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misha (an Russian Olympic mascot, not a person). When a last name is known, obviously the article would be renamed.

Next I did not just paste in some news report. I stitched together various reports in a logical topical arrangement using unique language plus direct quotes from involved people. 

I created it from a variety of sources (over 7 different ones anyway) and ref'd the heck out every statement per BPL which says """"We must get the article right. Be very firm about the use of high-quality sources. All quotations and any material challenged or likely to be challenged must be explicitly attributed to a reliable, published source, which is usually done with an inline citation. Contentious material about living persons (or in some cases, recently deceased) that is unsourced or poorly sourced – whether the material is negative, positive, neutral, or just questionable – should be removed immediately and without waiting for discussion."""". Before saying this is a BLP violation please show which statements were not reliably sourced to published sources with inline citations.

I did ref the Daily Mail (admit not the very best source at times) sometimes because they were pulling info from various places and some of it was a little different than other sources so I wanted to reflect both versions where info seemed to conflict. However, the most comprehensive source I've found so far is an AP article. http://bigstory.ap.org/article/bomb-suspect-influenced-mysterious-radical There are more than 1.1 million hits on Google for """"Boston Marathon Misha"""" as I write so an argument that this person is not WELLKNOWN is debatable. 

The article is not strictly negative. It states reported bio info (granted there is limited info to report). Mostly it summarizes a real debate through the media between various family members (mainly the Maryland uncle and a former husband of a sister) who cite Misha as the driving force behind Tam's radicalization and the mother who says he was just a nice guy. The various interviews are easy to find and widely quoted, though I believe the refs were mostly to the original media sources or multiple sources.  

There is some wild speculation about this guy by the media out there. I specifically excluded any of that from the article. My goal was to write an over referenced, comprehensive, neutral, informative article that accurately pulls together the various media reports so far.  Like many articles, there is room for improvement. The article was redirected (as a sub for a deletion nomination) before anyone even had a chance to properly review it and improve it. 

BLPCRIME may not apply as no one, and certianly not the article, is accusing Misha of a crime.

The absence of a known complete name does not disqualify a person from having a Wikipedia article. Consider DB Copper and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Placeholder_name 
Anyway, considering how many people are searching this guy I expect he will be found and a page will get created or restored.  Cheers,   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks.   Believe it or not in the real world I think that we think mostly alike on this.   I'm for the societal normalizaion of homosexuality.   I'm not for the nasty tactics used by some folks who feel that way, including branding anybody who feels otherwise as having a phobia.    And such work against themselves.     But in a Wikipedia sense, such opinions are not relevant.  Two definitions of the word exist, and one of them is sky-is-blue obviously controversial. The problem with the article is that, as a part of a POV quest, it pretends that the more controversial """"all opposition is phobia"""" definition is the ONLY definition. That would be just a difference of opinion but the more severe problem there is the nasty tactics used by a certain cadre there against people who do not agree with their quest.  I think that they have set the record for the amount of bogus tactics and bogus accusations used against a fellow editor.  And when I see people using such tactics against people in Wikipedia to further their purposes, I really see red.

The arbitration comity has absolutly nothing to do with the actual gangs war who is going on in wiki and I demand your immediat removal from the case as completely unable to distinguish on this basic fact.
You are of no good at all and I certainly do not wish for an arbitration comity to be formed of people who do not have any conscience nor ethic, nor sense of duty, and who don't even look at the case at hand nor read what the arbitration subject is about, before emitting their opinionated evaluations and sentences.

 BTW, XAL (or """"Sophie"""" or whomever you are), I usually don't read your rantings (I responded to your post above that ended with the sweet """"let's work together as a team"""" because it didn't sound like a rant), but this was pointed to me.

 In fact, I was blocked for 24 hours along with Igor by 315, for 3RR violation. but there is a difference:  I submitted to the block, I didn't go unregistered and find another IP to post anyway, but Igor did not submit to it.  he refused to abide by and posted to this talk page above """"Dear Marudubshinki...""""  This suggests that Igor believes he is above the rules.  the 3RR doesn't apply to him, does it?

 this reminds me of a time when i was a kid and we were saying """"table grace"""" before our meal.  my parents told us all that we had to be reverend, bow our heads, and close our eyes when we were praying our table prayer.  well, i left mine open and so did my much younger brother and when the prayer was over, he immediately tattled on me saying to our parents that """"Bob didn't close his eyes for the prayer.""""  geee, how did he know?

 well, it was Igor who made the complaint of the many reversions of mine and the admins decided (correctly) that he was reverting just as often as i was and the blocked us both.  but since the rules don't apply to Igor, he went and posted (using IP address for instead of logging in to his account) anyway.  it seems to me that the timing of this refusal to abide by his block was coincidental to when Snowspinner's tolerance for Igor's arrogance hit his/her limit and that's when the """"excrement"""" really hit the fan for Igor.   

?????rjb or whomever you are, I am the alone one ever in wiki on this case, both english and french who has posted with her full name and adress and telephon number and private emails, twice, and referes most of the time with both ip adress and real name, even before I had my own registration name on wiki, so suck your puppets! if cyber leaking make it possible you will soon get a 3D experience with Maharishi Maesh Yogi YBM dito Jean Perre Voyer dito leuven dito mister Rupley. {Replay!} supra transcendental levitations.....

 Point by point 

(1) The current text has:
Take, for example, the rainbow of colours reflected from a puddle of water when a thin film of oil rests on its surface. That phenomenon can be understood by thinking of light as waves, the length of which results in different colours.A very clear explanation of interference in thin films may be found in Sears, op. cit., p. 203ff. Other phenomena, like the working of light meters in cameras, can be explained by thinking in terms of particles of light (called photons) colliding with the detection screen inside the meter, the force of which is registered mechanically by a pointer or needle.

This is just plain wrong.  The length of waves does not """"result in different colours."""" The different wavelengths of light are perceived as different colors.  And the fact that the waves of light have different lengths does not explain the """"rainbow of colours"""" either. If the editor had bothered to read Sears he would have an understanding that would allow a correct explanation, not an exercise in the mystification of the novice reader.  

Second, the description of the light meter suggests a device like the carnival strength meter in which a contestant strikes a lever using a sledge hammer and the other end of the lever hits a ball that then moves vertically alongside a measuring stick of some kind. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Even if the crude analogy of an electron as a bullet that strikes electrons and knocks them out of their original planetary orbits be accepted, the electrons do not then physically strike the end of a needle that then moves along a dial face. T

If this article is to be radically rewritten, it should be done so with both a clear understanding of what the true facts are and also with an eye to presenting those facts in a way that will not cause very damaging preconceptions to form in the mind of the novice reader.

It is the differences in phases between the light waves reflected by the air/oil surface vs. the phases in the light waves reflected by the oil/water interface that effectively """"cancels"""" light of some wavelengths and permits light of some wavelengths to reach the eye of the observer from each different region of thickness of the oil film.  You criticized the original diagram that clearly shows how interference occurs as """"off-putting."""" But what have you put in its place?

It is the (mechanical analogy) pressure of the dislodged electrons that moves them off of the surface of the metal plate and through a wire to an electromagnet that attracts the spring-balanced needle which then moves in a way proportional to the induced amperage. Then they go through another wire back to the """"low pressure"""" region of the metal plate. Even in modern light meters, it is all a matter of electrons moving in electrical circuits, not electrons pushing on lever arms.

Please be careful to give the most useful citations. I have discovered one citation that is a circular reference to a Wikipedia article by way of an external """"encyclopedia."""" Also, the expression """"Trojan wave packet"""" will not mean anything to the average well informed reader, hence serving only to create an air of mystery and incomprehensibility.

It is a baseless insult with no constructive intention.  """"Rubbish"""" is an ad hominem attack.  There is nothing constructive other than an insult of another contributors work.  Telling fiddle they he or she has an """"arrogant obtuse attitude"""" was constructive with the intention of advice on how to better deal with new posters.  """"Instead of posting rubbish"""" is both an arrogant and insulting statement.  It did nothing to help me create a better article, OR give reasons why the SKK article was being deleted.  """"Rubbish"""" is not an objective criteria.  """"This article has already been posted & debated"""" is.  Of course this fact never was brought up until after the discussion was well out of hand.

Second, you cannot with any intellectual honesty characterize what I posted as """"vandalism.""""  My repeated intention was to make a sincere contribution of a topic that I felt is important.  I was more than happy to discuss the merits of the article as evidenced by my fruitless attempt to use the """"hangon"""" tag.

 Reply to your question 

I'm curious as to why you (Mister Hospodar) conclude that everyone who disagrees with you (that is, everyone you've encountered on Wikipedia thus far) must be part of a nefarious conspiracy, and why they must be """"paid"""" by their """"bosses"""" to """"police"""" these articles. Leaving aside the various behavioral policies violated by such repetitive accusations, do you think alternate explanations are possible, if not likely? For example, is it possible that people edit these articles out of a desire to create a serious, respectable reference work - one that treats discredited claims honestly as discredited claims, rather creating a false impression of ongoing scientific debate? Could these nefarious editors possibly be motivated to contribute their free time to ensure that potentially important medical information here accurately reflects the knowledge of scholars and experts in the field? MastCell Talk 

In reply to the above question, I will state that NO, there is no other possible explanation for editors who take down within 30 minutes any edits that disagree with their agenda without considering the logic or validity of these edits, many of which edits greatly improve the articles in question; whose arguments funnel always into the same tired arguments and bullying, all of which adhere to a fixed political agenda and specific types of censorship; who are on call seemingly 24 hours a day for years to revert any edit which they think is damning to their agenda; who spend countless hours creating specious, illogical arguments and trying the time-worn tactic of  invalidating their """"opponents"""" with name-calling and fringe accusations; who ridicule and demean everyone, including established scientists, who disagree with their agenda; who are clearly not clever or informed enough to be operating on their own, say, as AIDS scientists or researchers who merely want to help the world with their knowledge; and who police a number of pages all related to the concerns of pharmaceutical companies, slamming alternative therapies and spreading disinformation about diseases.

I put this on Shabby's talk page and I thought you should check it out as well:

Hi, I noticed you were taking part in the discussion on the Talk:Hwang Seong-gyeong page. I think Bethereds behaviour is ridiculous and something needs to be done to stop his ownership of these pages. He said that he would """"change the pages back until the end of time"""" as he thinks he is right in removing any Japanese reference from """"his"""" Korean pages. There are many reasons why Japanese katakana should be included in these pages (the obvious being that the characters are created by a Japanese company and that every other article includes it bar the few Korean characters). Is there any way to call a moderator or administrator to this debate to stop Bethereds reverts? He seems to have no proper reason as to why he is omitting the information other than he believes Korea is better than Japan (I've read his user page and looked at his previous edits and he seems to be doing anything he can to promote Korea over Japan). Does he not realise that in these games, even Chang and Kim (from KOF) speak in the Japanese language and have never even uttered a Korean word? We need a vote or something to put him right. Thanks.

The ad hominem attacks were removed, and then accusations by  were manufactured of having an """"edit war"""", when he was the one to start trashing the page after it was approved.  was also the one to start a destruction campaign against the separate page that the critical links and books were on before. He appears to be very fundamentalist and not too concerned about using propaganda and slander to dissuade people from seeing any critical information. His accusations (beside being ad hominem) were also completely incorrect. Duffer appears not to give a damn about accuracy, or relevance, or the fact that ad hominem and propaganda are not acceptable on Wikepedia. JWs usually refer to this trashing and slander as """"theocratic war strategy"""", basically meaning anything goes (including lies and slander) if the end result is to promote the religion. I have removed the ad hominem and I hope it will not return.  is also problematic in the same regard, as he appears to not realise when he is using propaganda, (or insults above) but is clear to see it when someone else may use it against him or JWs, demonstrating his interesting double standards (a sad, but typical Watch Tower Society characteristic).

if that's the case, he'd better get busy deleting """"his"""" article! ROFL

please
i haven't the heart to participate in this article anymore, but would somebody please revert the POV at least oldwindybear inserted? i put in my time. surely there's a knowledgeable B&C; freak out there who can at least stand guard for a while, if not improve the article from even its pre-vandalism state.  

note to oldwindybear
before you insert your allegations once again (hopefully somewhere that doesn't break up my signed comment), you may want to consider some immutable truths which i hoped you would have noticed before launching the terribly wrong rant i just removed from within my signed comments. (unlike you, i do not want somebody else's words attributed to me):

the version i quoted above as """"wikipedia"""" in the comparison is entirely from 12:03, 20 June 2005 UTC.
you claim to have contributed to the article as  and .
the first edit by  in the article was 20:21, 5 September 2005 UTC.
the first edit by  in the article was 20:06, 4 September 2005 UTC.
therefore, you did not write a single word of the article version in the comparison above.

please take a moment to let that sink in: you did not write a single word of the article version in the comparison above.

you also misapprehend the definition of plagiarism. it has nothing to do with copyright. you used entire blocks of words of other authors (primarily me), and credited yourself as the author. that is plagiarism.

though my initial contributions to the article are readily viewable in the history (and later as another user and several IPs), i want to steer away from the """"i wrote x amount"""" aspect, because the article was and is a collaborative effort. the troubling part, not only for me, but also for the owner of the site to which you submitted """"your"""" article, is that you used whole blocks from a wikipedia article to which you contributed not a single word, and not only put your name to it, but did not even cite wikipedia as a source.

contrary to the fraudulent hiding of your sources while merely peppering whole blocks of material you stole, i did write the actual unquoted prose in my contributions myself, while citing clearly all of my sources. despite your assertion, the version you stole from stated explicitly, """"Known primarily for robbing banks, he preferred smaller jobs, robbing grocery stores and filling stations at a rate far outpacing the ten to fifteen bank robberies attributed to him and the Barrow gang."""" as with everything else in the wikipedia side of the comparison, none of that is your writing. neither, as has been raised and explained several times already, were you the first in this article to raise the issue of legality with regard to the killing of bonnie parker. this has all been explained. please do not bully other users into holding your hand. take a moment. review the article history. review the discussion. slow down and pay attention.

in short, there isn't a leg to stand on if attempting to rebut my charge of plagiarism. you did not arrive on the scene until over 2 months had passed from when the version in the comparison was written. i'll say again: you did not contribute a single syllable to it. yet you lifted whole sections from it, changing very little — in some cases none — and put your name to it. that, sir, is the very definition of plagiarism, and it doesn't matter whether i or any other editor wrote the source material you took; you wrote none of it. the partial copying at the beginning (which you picked out to rebut) was what i already labeled as only """"minor lifting"""". be honest. it gets far worse. it gets embarrassingly worse. please don't try to fabricate stories which anybody poring through the history can instantly recognize as vapor. the sad part is that the entire facade of """"your article"""" was as an excuse for you to insert even more POV into articles. if you don't understand WP:NPOV, WP:NOR, WP:V, etc. after so many people have tried explaining them to you, perhaps wikipedia isn't the plac",0,0,0,0,0,0

Brion, please be informed, as I will also inform our Filipino editors in Tambayan, that the entire judiciary will be at half mast to mourn Judge Edon Brion's demise amid necrological services, being the main feature and the November 22, 2008, burial near your barrio, in San Pablo City. As you had known, I sat beside Arturo D. Brion's wife, my seat and classmate Antonietta from 1978-1982, Ateneo Law School. And I accepted God's will for me as closed Catholic amid my strong faith when I predicted the Supreme Court appointment of Brion as the Benjamin of the Court, way back on 2003 when I can't forget the pansit canton the spouses served me in Pandacan, Manila, so memorable. And Arturo D. Brion, signed the final Court resolution which put the final nail to my judicial career's coffin on June 3, 2008, exactly 25 years from June 3, 1983, when LUIS, Armand and Angel, holy angels of God first faced destiny and me-my brother Robert. Judge and Justice Brion are our icon. I had continuously prayed Psalm 109 as you noted in your email to me. Peace of Christ!

A poor start, sorry. The author seems to be totally mislead about both real history and the opinions on the table. First of all, no common two-nations table is possible (patent nonsense). Second, I object the following:
the passage from the Russian table speaking of the Kievan Rus. As someone suggested earlier, that table should by any mean include a disclaimer explaining very loose ancestry between Kievan Rus and modern Russia. This is the main disputed claim (commented enough in other articles), unacceptable for me and several other Ukrainian and Belarusian users
Regardless of any """"Ukrainian military"""" table, none of them may include the Red Army. This army was not only irrelevant to any of Ukrainian states (with very formal post-WWII exception), but also significantly anti-Ukrainian. For instance, Red Army units widely participated in war crimes against Ukrainian population and anti-Soviet guerillas. Creation of the """"Ukrainian"""" table here has been a mere discussion trick not supported by all Ukrainian users. For instance, see earlier AlexPU's passage on """"trading the truth""""

 Narciso Yepes 

Please refrain from making edits to subjects you clearly know very little about. Yepes collaborated with Ramirez, not Bernabe, to invent his guitar. Bernabe (an apprentice of Ramirez) later formed his own shop and Yepes subsequently played a Bernabe 10-string. As for your comment about Yepes's hands, this is simply ignorant as to the true reasons why Yepes invented his guitar as well as the technique of playing it (which was NOT to use open basses to simplify technique as some nitwits think - including 10-string guitarists and clueless former students of Yepes). I have the autograph manuscripts to prove that more often than not he used fretted basses rather than open ones even when the open ones were available, depending on what best served the music. Do you have these proofs??? NO. So please stick to what you actually know. (FYI Yepes had extended techniques that enabled him to fret the first string's D together with the low G on the 6th string by using the left hand thumb. Again, we have the proof of this. It was even published in one of his old Scarlatti editions.)  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 129.94.133.166   

 Your discussion at Narciso Yepes 

First, you added information that was NOT CORRECT, except for the reason you gave for Yepes's death. And it is not constructive to to add biased, unneutral opinions like Yepes was the most """"notorious""""...

Second, it is a well-established fact that RAMIREZ and Yepes invented his ten-string guitar. As I said, Bernabe was an apprentice at the Ramirez shop then, but the first Yepes-type ten-string guitar was a RAMIREZ guitar. Moreover, Ramirez had the idea to construct a guitarra d'amor with multiple string resonators INSIDE the body of the guitar. This was rejected by both Segovia and Yepes as impractical. It was Yepes who solved the theoretical and technical problems by adding only 4 strings tuned a very specific way (C, A#, G#, F#) alongside the normal 6 strings. You want a verifiable source? Here: Ramirez III, Jose. 1994. """"The Ten-String Guitar"""" in Things About the Guitar. Bold Strummer. pp. 137-141. [ISBN-10: 8487969402]

Third, I clearly said Yepes fretted bass notes even when the same bass notes were available as open strings! F# or G# are very often played fretted rather than open! I have this in his own handwriting and own fingering yet you will presume to know better and call this fact """"worthless"""" because it disproves your ignorant (unconstructive) remark about Yepes' """"short hands"""" being a reason for playing a 10-string guitar. Furthermore, Yepes frequently uses the 7th fretted (because it is the lowest string), but not """"frequently"""" the 8th (as you mistakenly claim), which is a minor 7th higher than the 7th string. Moreover, these strings can be used to voice chords as originally written in the urtexts by non-guitarist composers like Ponce or Rodrigo that are impossible on the 6-string (except in the edited versions). Being able to use open strings as """"crutches"""" for a lack of technique was certainly NOT part of Yepes's entirely musical reasons for inventing his guitar - though (I will add) many ten-string guitarists today (who are second-rate guitariats in general) have adopted the instrument to make up for weak techniques. This has NOTHING to do with Yepes's own performance practice on his instrument. As someone who has studied for over a decade with one of Yepes's leading (long-term) students, as someone who has thoroughly researched all aspects of the 10-string guitar, as someone who has access to many many unpublished manuscripts and annotations, I can safely say that I know what I am talking about. Yepes even frets A2 and G2# on the 10th string rather than play them on the open A2 and G2# strings (5 and 9) in an example I have in his own handwriting, and the reasons for doing so are in the context entirely MUSICAL and not about any technical limitations, which exist only in your imagination!

Melanin Factors

Karanja Keita Carroll

One of the most controversial areas of Afrikan/Black psychology is the role of melanin within certain areas of theory and research. While this topic is controversial and actually causes some to disregard this research, we must continually critically investigate the theories and research that is produced around this biological chemical of life. Azibo (2002) actually argues, â€œ[t]his area of study is deserving of our best scholarship, not our ignorant, out of hand, and deferential to white sensibilities derisionâ€ (p. 429). In accord with Aziboâ€™s statement, this essay will attempt to systematically engage the role of melanin within humans, and Afrikans in particular. The information presented here will also show the connections Afrikan/Black psychologists are able to make between melanin and Afrikan behavioral functioning. 

Melanin can be defined as a class of pigments found in the cosmos. Etymologically the term comes from the Greek melanos, meaning black (Barnes, 1988). There are four major types of melanin: eumelanin, phaeomelanin, allomelanin and neuromelanin. Each type of melanin represents a different composition and location within the body. While the first three types of melanin can be found throughout areas of the body, neuromelanin is the only type of melanin found in the brain (Owens Moore, 1995; King, 1991a, 1991b). The most important feature of melanin is its ability to absorb, retain, store and regenerate energy.

To understand the importance of melanin to optimal human functioning we must look at the foundation of creation in human beings. This process is known as embryogenesis. According to Bynum (1999),

During embryogenesis or the development of the embryo in the uterus, there is an interesting unfoldment. After conception the female egg begins to divide into a cluster of fetal cells called a blastula. The initial blastula unfolds three distinct layers of cells, the outermost level or ectoderm, the inner layer or endoderm, and the mesoderm...The ectoderm layer contains melanin in high concentrations throughout its region (Pearse, 1969; Pearse & Takor, 1976). Only 28 hours after conception, the ecotoderm has moved into the interior of the blastula and begun to form a neural tube. During embroygenesis0 this neural tube develops into the precursor of the brain and spinal line. The neural tube unfolds into the spinal cord, the end of the tube or the neural crest mid-point develops into the brain, and very importantly, the cells along the tube evolve into light sensitive melanocyctes, which eventually develop into all of the endocrine glands, e.g., pineal, pituitary, adrenal, mast cells, hypothalamus, thyroid, parathyroid, pancreas and others that will develop in the gastrointestinal tract, lungs, and heart (King, 1990; Welbourn, 1977). (p. 148-159)

While this extensive quotation by Bynum clearly shows the role of melanin in the embroygenesis process, what must be understood is that without melanin in this process, life does not begin.

Also, from this extensive quotation, we are able to see the many areas melanin affects the human system. The most important layer of the blastula is the ectoderm which creates the neural tube, neural crest, and the epidermal layer. The neural tube and neural crest will transform into the brain and spinal cord (Central Nervous System/CNS) and the external sense organs (ears, eyes). The epidermal layer will transform into the epidermis and epidermal tissues. The CNS controls the sensory, neuromuscular, hormonal organs of the body. Impairment of the CNS affects human sensitivity, movement and consciousness (Owens Moore, 1995). Ultimately with this discussion of the ectoderm, we see that as the Afrikan worldview states, everything is interrelated and connected. This will have a profound effect upon the impact of melanin on behavioral functioning.

From this very general overview, we come to recognize the role of melanin throughout the human organism. Areas of importance that have high levels of melanin include the epidermis, hair, eyes, ears and brain. Within the brain, specifically the brainstem, locus coloreous, substantia nigra, pituitary gland and pineal gland (Barnes, 1988; King, 2001a, 2001b). 

The role of melanin within embryogenesis lays the foundation of melanin throughout the human organism. What must be stressed is the fact that all organisms have melanin, but the level and proportion of melanin distribution strictly reflects oneâ€™s historical relation to their environment (Lasker, 1969)",0,0,0,0,0,0

Since we're NOT SUPPOSED TO SPECULATE on Wikipedia, calling it a hack is against the rules you so properly city.

Until such time, Occam's Razor leans towards it being either the act of a whistle-blower, or (since there is significant evidence in both the computer code itself, and in previous errant leaks of accidentally putting files on a web server that they did not intend to release) that this is typical data mismanagement because Jones and CRU apparently wouldn't hire anybody with any IT professionals (for fear that anyone outside the cabal would have blown the whistle a decade ago?)

Receiving money from KGB (edit request)
Rajiv Gandhi and his family including Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi received money from KGB. The payments were authorised by a resolution and endorsed by the USSR Council of Ministers, and had been coming since 1971. In December 2001, Subramanian Swamy filed a writ petition in the Delhi High Court, acting on which the court ordered CBI to ascertain the truth of the allegations in May 2002. After two years, the CBI told the Court that Russia would not entertain such queries without a registered FIR.

Since the Rajiv Gandhi (former PM of India) page mentions the above, this should be mentioned on Rahul's page too. This guy is being projected as the next Prime Minister of India.

Romanization for words of English origin
On the MOS:JP talk page, a discussion has been started about including or not including romanizations for words of English origin, such as Fainaru Fantajī in  (for the sake of simplicity, I called this case """"words of English origin"""", more information on semantics here).

Over the course of a month, it has become apparent that both the parties proposing to include or not include those romanizations cannot be convinced by the arguments or guidelines brought up by the other side. Therefore, a compromise is trying to be found that will satisfy both parties. One suggestion on a compromise has been given already, but it has not found unanimous agreement, so additional compromises are encouraged to be suggested.

At the top of this section Funkynusayri said """"this article should rather be called Nordic race with Nordic supremacy theory as a sub-section of it"""". That's not an objection to merging, it's an argument in favour of merging, with one aspect contained within another in the same article. We all know that there was historical concept of a 'Nordic race'. No-one disputes that. The question is whether there is any point having a separate article about it, distinct from the cultural and ideological uses to which it has been put. If both can managably be contained in the same article, then they should be. The Mediterranean race article contains both aspects, and so should this one. The title is rather a separate question. Nordic theory is a name that was created by user:fastfission to merge the term Nordic race with the idea that the concept became historically significant because there were specific theories about it. After all, that's what makes this page different from the others. This topic has a long, sometimes acrimonious, Talk page. If you look up Mediterranean race there is far less discussion, and there is almost none on Alpine race or Dinaric race.

A merger is probably a good idea.  First, the prehistoric man article is terrible.  In fact it shouldn't exist as anything other than a stub.  The term """"Prehistoric man"""" is no longer used by scholars and hasn't been since the 1970's becuase it is androcentric and because there really is no such thing as a group or type of people who are characteristically """"prehistoric"""".  In other words, people in prehistoric societies have no particualar commonalities except a lack of writing.  Prehistory is a rubric used by scholars to differentiate the methods used to study the past, not a type of people.  There is no such thing as a stage of personhood or social development in which a person is a prehistoric man or woman.  For example, the Inca remained a prehistoric people until the Spanish conquest and yet they ruled one of the most impressive empires on earth and still had no writen records (quipa were memory aids, not writing).  In Central America, the prehistoric period starts more than a thousand years earlier.  Further, the term is Eurocentric and based on the notion of progressive stages of """"mankind"""" like the """"stone age"""".  There are people who still use stone tools.  The """"ages as stages"""" concepts have long since been abandoned in the social sciences since they do not apply universally and can not be tied directly to other political and social developments around the world.

This section is basically the longest in the article, and it thus gives undue weight to stuff that is not really core. I propose to thin this section down to focus on the controverial issue around slavery. Any objections?   
Herodotus is in the Classical section and is quoted from Du Bois. Regarding the length of that 19th section, I have no comments for the moment. Actually, I see other sections with the same length.

The following refers to 3.5.2 - Ukrainian Oppression.

I was looking through the Ukrainian Oppression section and I noticed that in the second line down, about half way through it says 'where' rather than were. It also says 'where' rather than were near the end of the first line in this section. This might confuse people so I was just asking whoever can do something about this, please do. Thanks.

Hello I would like to raise a concern that there are two vandals User:Noclador & User:MrMacMan they have been editing all articles that have to do with the Albanian military non are correct I have been blocked in two occasions for no reason, I have tried talking with them and reasoning with them but they are not listening they even changed the my words that I put in their discussion are to seem like I was attacking them so I would get banned, I would really appreciate if you take some action against these users, they have only provided one source for their edit that is 3 years old and even that does not match with he figures and information they have given, in their source it states that Albania operates 375 tanks and User:Noclador wrote that the tank inventory is only 79 which does not match at all with his source, every time I fix the information so it matches with his source he reverts it, I also have added the PVO banner because me and some other people do not agree with their sources and they keep removing it.

I have cities all of my edits but for some reason they keep changing them with older information and as it ways in the wikipedia dispute article you should give let them have their wary and I am letting them use their source for now but they can at least quote their source correctly and not make number from the top of their heads.",0,0,0,0,0,0

7fa8155b9f441d5c,"Nephilim deleted edit 

You state reliable sources. The first part of my edit is that which is taught in college (you would know if you ever attended). It is taught in literature class. It is: When studying this passage, or any passage of the Bible, it is best to use the Exegetical method, which is tearing it down to the bottom and rebuilding it using 6 contexts. First, one must use the Bible to interpret the Bible. Second, using the 6 contexts, which are: 1. What is the context (main idea, or thought) of the Bible?, 2. What is the context of the book you are reading (Genesis, Exodus, etc.)?, 3. What is the context of the chapter you are reading?, 4. What is the context of the verse you are reading? 5. What is the context of the key words?, and 6. What is the historical context? How did the people of that time think, act, etc. An example, to name something is to place one's authority on it. A king of a city state that has conquered another city state gives it a new name, because he is place his authority on it. Two things to keep in mind for a sound, correct interpretation of this passage are: 1. Where is the beginning of the narrative; the pivotal spot? It is Genesis 3:15, which is a prophecy of Christ and the beginning of the battle between evil and good. It is followed by the first example the story of Cain and Abel., 2. In the original Bible there were no chapter or verses, these were added later to make it easier to find passages. The story of the Flood begins at Genesis 4:17 and goes to Genesis 9:7 (this story should have been 1 chapter).
This aids the scholar attempting to understand and interpret a difficult passage. 
The next part: Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-27-5, New Wilson's Old Testament Word Studies, William Wilson; Kregel Publications 1987, ISBN 0-8254-4030-0/ both page 185)renders the word nephilim meaning as to fall upon other in rapine violence and apostates fallen from true religion. Strong's Exhaustive Concordance Of The Bible Hebrew and Chaldee Dictionary, James Strong (MacDonald Publishing Co. ISBN 0-917006-01-1) cites the word as a bully,tyrant, or dictator. 
Here is given references to where the data is gotten (even page numbers), but by what you say this is reliable or acceptable. Just what would be.
The next part: One can get copies of the First and Second Book of Enoch, which one can read. Two such books are The Old Testament Pseudepigrapha, Vol 1(Doubleday & Co. Inc., 1983 ISBN 0-385-09630-5)and The Other Bible(Harper & Row, Publishers ISBN 0-06-250031-7)and there others. A WARNING. When reading these books keep in mind that they are non-canonical and are considered fictional; not God inspired and truthful. When one reads the Book of Enoch one sees a measurement for the offspring as 300 cubits. A cubit is 18 inches (check any Bible dictionary), or 1 1/2 feet. As such the offspring is 450 feet tall.
This again shows where one can find the data. All these references are from PUBLISHED and ESTABLISHED books, that is accepted by college professors, but not by you. How did the article get on Wikipedia? Did the author bribe someone, or is it that they are a dear buddy?
You may think this harsh, and it may be, but it is deserved. The reason why the information has been verified with published authentic sources that you refuse to accept. Then what needs to take place is that the articles references must be rejected as well for they are based on the same method and material. Why accept one person's references and not an others when both are from published established sources available to the public.
Once before I attempted this folly on an other article and again nothing, not even a police report, was accepted. The only thing I can think for this is that Wikipedia employees are not getting their palm greased, or that I am not a dear buddy with an in.
The reliable verified referenced attainable data is beneficial and helpful to the reader and scholar, but you and Wikipedia don't care, and spit on me, my effort to help, and the ones who would have benefited from it.

The truth is that the English language really has no equivalent to Freiherr (the title of the ruler) or Freiherrschaft (the title of the political entity), because neither or them existed in the English-speaking world.  The loose translations sometimes given (baron, barony) are inaccurate, in that they do not convey the concept of independent jurisdiction.  Medieval English barons were juridically much more subject to the kings than these (except for the few exceptions such as the liberty of the bishops of Durham and a few other historical exotica).
The concept wasn't limited to Silesia.  It existed throughout the Holy Roman Empire and within the hereditary domains of the Habsburgs, such as Bohemia after 1621.

Hi David, great explanation and thank you.
I acknowledge and accept your main points above.  My only argument is that the term """"British Isles"""" is being used as a substitute for a more accurate term.  If we substituted the word """"Europe"""", we would lose the point that this was the first anglican bishop to not swear allegiance to the British monarch on behalf of a """"province"""" outside the kindoms controlled by the British monarch (in enemy territory).  The scottish anglicans were still within the area (Kingdom of Great Britain).  As a note, the relevance is those two points taken together - not swearing allegiance *and* not being in an area controlled by the monarch.
BTW, what is the connection between the consecration of Samuel Seabury and the founding of the new province?  Is it assumed that the new province was recognized immediately?  If so, what is the relevance of representative clergy from nine dioceses meeting in Philadelphia to ratify the church's initial constitution in 1789?  Is this the actual official founding of the province?
If you are happy to substitute the term with kingdoms of Great Britain and Ireland as a compromise, I am fine with that.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Clarification on Wikipedia naming standards 

Hi Kohikoi,

You just left a message on my talkpage where you immediately threatened to block me out of the blue instead of a friendly suggestion or attempt to discuss/investigate. I would like to remind you that Wikipedia:Administrator_Code_of_Conduct | Wikipedia admin code of conduct}} guidelines specifically state...

threatening a user with an inappropriate block is just as bad behavior as actually making that block
admins should never use their admin abilities to intimidate others

To deal with your concerns though. From my tandpoint I just corrected a breach of Wikipedia naming standards that appear politically motivated. However,you just suggested the current version of these pages are the result of a long-standing consensus between several users. Do you have evidence of this consensus? (i.e Where exactly is it reported on Wikipedia?) As far as I can tell the page for  naming conventions of Greek and Turkish named places specifically states... 

""""This Wikipedia page is currently inactive and is retained as a historical archive. Either the page is no longer relevant or consensus has become unclear. If you want to revive discussion regarding the subject, you should seek broader input via a forum such as the proposals page of the village pump.""""

Furthermore, I have to ask why is there suddenly a special page only for Greek/Turkish naming conventions in the first place? The standards proposed on that page appear to directly contridict broader Wikipedia naming standards which state...

Use modern English names for titles and in articles. Historical names or names in other languages can be used in the lead if they are frequently used and important enough to be valuable to readers, and should be used in articles with caution.

Hi, Rick Norwood. Funny but I find just the opposite to be true. Badly written edits, i.e. blatant attempts at removing meaning from articles, are mostly done by left-leaning (socialist, modern liberal, etc.) editors. Also, the large majority of editors, and not suprisingly, admins here at the wiki, are socialist and in general left-leaning and are dominating many of the political articles. The meaning of words, the correct charictarization of ideologies, and history itself, is being altered. This article is a prime example of this aricle take-over and the propaganda that is being strongly pushed here. I predict it will be the downfall of Wikipedia. This is sad to me because, what could have been a free and inclusive collaberation of knowledge, has been turned into a giant machine that spits out non-fact, censorship, and well, just plain propagandistic cow flop.

I have created an adoption program to help teach my adoptees. I give out tests that are graded and looked over twice and a classroom so my teachers can help teach students. I would like many peoples opinions on this. talk 
You've only been on Wiki for a month and you have an adoption program? Am I missing something?   
Well, I do have 3300+ edits, and I'm trying to edit more on the mainspace more. Any comments? talk 
I think that this is ridiculous. You are not at all an experienced user, you have only 312 edits in mainspace, only one page move. Do you know the fair use policy, the naming conventions, the banning policy ? etc. I see that you want to become an admin when you'll have over 5000 edits, well, you should look closer at recent RFAs. By the way, some people are offended nowadays because some users think that Wikipedia is just another (curious) facebook, myspace, or RPG ... You should take this into account too. I don't mean to be offending either, I see that you encourage people to give their opinion (the review etc), I just give mine. Something is wrong too, why have you chosen this page to post your adoption program ? It's meant to be a user talk page (cf the corresponding policies/guidelines), it's not the community bulletin board. Back to the adoption program, I think that you should wait several months before working on this. If you wish, we can continue this discussion, somewhere else.  Talk 
 raises very valid points above. What is it you (RyRy5) are hoping to achieve here? And what do pages such as  and  have to do with improving the encyclopedia?  Most importantly, the following sort of edits appear to have more to do with inflating edit count than anything else: , , , , .

Who said the nerd cabal has nothing to do? O -  
While I don't care about some pleasant humor (the BRC is quite acceptable), the sudden recent influx of cabals, most of them created by what I suspect are teenage editors, is completely unnecessary. The adoption is also premature. I don't care about the so-called """"edit-count pumping"""" edits, though; minor edits are plenty useful.

I have seen in this article there is an issue of consensus regarding the name. Let me shed some light on the same:

1) Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin was the religious leader of Dawoodi Bohra sect, just like Pope is to Christanity. Since calling the Pope, Pope John Paul is allowed in Wikipedia, the name Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin should also be allowed. Here Syedna is the word used instead of Pope. Furthermore just like the Pope, Syedna is also placed before only one person in the world in Dawoodi Bohra community. Just like Pope it indicates leadership. So by not allowing to use it would amount to discrimination on the part of Wikipedia and its editors and administrators and other authorities towards a minority sect. 

2) All the verifications in Wikipedia is done on the basis of media references and in the entire media Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin is refered to as Syedna Mohammed Burhanuddin.

I would like to request the editors to please do not confuse yourselves by the issues raised by people with less knowledge regarding this article and resolving the issue of name move ahead and concentrate on improving the content of the article.

 Adding alternative POV to the article 
This article's neutrality is questionable.  How should we add alternative articles into the text?  I propose that we add """"alleged"""" to the opening paragraph and include references that show that the facts and details are in dispute.

The Chameleon (Dmitri Smerdyakov) is a Marvel Comics supervillain, an enemy of Spider-Man. The Chameleon is a spy and master of disguise. Throughout his history, he has used a variety of traditional, high-tech and biologically enhanced ways to change his appearance, believably imitating almost anyone. He was also the ally, servant, and half-brother of fellow Spider-Man adversary Kraven the Hunter. His name is derived from the characters Dmitri and Smerdyakov from The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoevsky.

Publication history Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Steve Ditko, he initially appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #1 (March 1963), and was the first member of Spider-Man's vast rogues' gallery, based on issue publication date, excluding the burglar who murdered Ben Parker. (Supercharger was the first Spider-Man supervillain chronologically.[1])

Novels The Chameleon had a vital role in the Sinister Six novel series by Adam-Troy Castro, in which the Gentleman, a long-lived supervillain and member of the Machiavelli Club (a gathering of some of the world's most sinister minds, including several non-Marvel characters) uses the new Sinister Six, of which the Chameleon is a member, as pawns in his schemes. Oddly enough, in this series he is referred to as Anatoly Smerdyakov. In the final novel in the series, Secret of the Sinister Six, the Gentleman betrays the villains and tries to escape; it is the Chameleon, to everybody's surprise, who kills the Gentleman, shooting the old man while disguised as a limousine driver and assuming his identity, only to be attacked by Dr. Octopus, thinking him to be the real Gentleman. Marvel has officially stated that the Sinister Six novels lay outside of normal continuity; however, these events have more recently been referenced in the Marvel handbooks. The Chameleon also plays the role of villain in the novel Goblin's Revenge. In this story, the Chameleon not only teams up with the murderous Carnage, but also attempts to drive Spider-Man insane by impersonating Norman Osborn (then thought to be dead and buried), and later trying to expose the web-slinger to a toxic chemical meant to destroy his mind.

Fictional character biography The Chameleon was born a Russian citizen named Dmitri Smerdyakov. In his youth, he was a servant and half-brother to Kraven the Hunter, Sergei Kravinoff, and eventually became a minor associate to one Gustav Fiers. Although Dmitri and Sergei were friends, Sergei was often abusive to him, leading to a combination of admiration and resentment towards Kravinoff from Smerdyakov. Eventually, Smerdyakov emigrated to the United States of America. As he had made a talent for himself during his youth, impressing his brother by impersonating friends and neighbors, he assumed an even more impressive disguise: the identity of the Chameleon. During his first known criminal outing, he impersonated Spider-Man, though he was exposed and arrested. Shortly afterward, Kravinoff, now Kraven the Hunter, himself came to America, and the Chameleon set his old associate's sights on Spider-Man.[2] Both men became long-time enemies of Spider-Man, part of his primary rogues' gallery. The Chameleon inspired Kraven the Hunter to begin hunting Spider-Man, inviting Kraven to dispose of the hero.[3] With Kraven, the Chameleon then battled Iron Man.[4] Chameleon then confronted the Hulk.[5] The Chameleon stole some paintings from an art exhibit, but was thwarted by Spider-Man.[6] The Chameleon disguised himself as Henry Pym, and robbed Pym's laboratory for documents to combat Virus Nine. He delivered the documents and a shrunken Hulk to HYDRA, but was defeated by the real Pym as Ant-Man.[7] The Chameleon disguised himself as the Torpedo and battled Daredevil.[8] The Chameleon later first used his hologram belt to disguise himself to unsuccessfully take revenge on Spider-Man.[9] When Kraven the Hunter committed suicide,[10] the Chameleon became obsessed with making Spider-Man suffer for his failure to prevent Kraven from killing himself. He ingested a serum which made his face permanently featureless and malleable. He attempted to kidnap America's leading expert on supe",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Dispute on your reply on Case Closed naming 

After your closing of WP:RM discussion on Case Closed, saying, inter alia,  seemed to be disputing invalid argements that you mentioned in the closing arguments. Please answer him/her there.  TALK·CONTRIBS 

Just a little misunderstanding, I think. I've addressed the issue there. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.  

 List of mycologists 
Thanks for creating the list of mycologists.  The only thing that might be missing is the author abbreviation.  I have been linking a lot of those lately in the mushroom articles.  

I noticed that the botanists have everything set up pretty well - They have a list of botanists with abbreviations and also a template to make it easy to put a box in an article that gives the abbreviation info.

I copied it and changed a couple words - Now we have:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Mycologist

I tried it out on Gaston Guzman.  

There are still some red links, I haven't decided if I should reword the template or add the articles that are in red.

What do you think?

 

I can see the advantage of having author abbreviations included on the list of mycologists, and I can't see the harm of a separate  to parallel , although since mycology falls under the ICBN, all mycologists are, in some sense, botanists (and many were both, particularly in the early days), so the links in the template should lead to author citation (botany) and botanical name. We should not expect a separate article on """"author citation (mycology)"""" to be created, since mycological naming is botanical naming, even if the organisms aren't plants.  

 Melolonthinae 

Thanks for fixing the errors I made in creating Melolonthinae. I took a leap creating it since I have zero practical knowledge of the subject. Hey this is totally random, but I figure you might know a thing or two about biology as a whole. Why does Canis lupus familiaris cover everything from a chihuahua to a great dane yet other animals with very minor variations (ex. Oncorhynchus mykiss gairdnerii, Oncorhynchus mykiss newberrii) are distinct subspecies?   C T 

The species is normally defined as a group of """"actually or potentially interbreeding populations"""" (the biological species concept), which means that if two animals can interbreed to produce fertile offspring, they are considered conspecific. Subspecies are defined more vaguely, as divisions of a species which are not different enough to prevent interbreeding, but which have fairly constant differences. I don't know what the morphological difference between O. m. newberrii and O. m. gairdnerii is, but I am sure there is one. The unusual situation is Canis lupus familiaris, which has been subject to artificial selection, and so exhibits much more physical variation than is normal for taxa of such limited genetic isolation. I am not sure whether it is really valid to apply scientific names to domestic dogs and the like in the first place, although it is widely done; perhaps it represents the scientific name of the wild taxon from which the domesticated breeds are derived. By contrast, cultivated plants have their own system of nomenclature, separate from the ICBN.

I believe that more offence is taken in the USA, as in the example of their changing 'titbit' to 'tidbit'. The word 'titbit' carries no offence whatesoever in the UK and 'Titbits' was the name of a general interest UK magazine for many years.

'Tits' is only a very mild and slightly comical expletive in UK use. The word 'piss' is more vulgar but can be found in the Bible. It might be heard in the matey environment of a pub, such as """"Joe has gone for a piss"""". It has more vehemence in """"piss off"""" but with less weight than the good old Anglo-Saxon """"fuck off"""".

As regards what the public take as swear words, even 'get stuffed' might be classed as such, yet there is 'stuff' in everything.

As with the Gordon Lightfoot explanation below, this is considered replacable in the article on Jacob.
Stills from movies are generally OK for use in articles about the movie or the character, but not in an article about the living actor. For example, note the truly horrible pic we are using for Kristin Scott Thomas and the complete lack of a pic for Naveen Andrews. Andrews' character in Lost, though, has a decent pic.

No problem, and I think many people appreciate a user saying """"job well done.""""  The commenting feature of HTML (the bracket exclamation point business) makes text invisible.  For instance, if you were to look at """"edit this page"""" you could see a sentence here: .   This is occasionally done in articles for a variety of reasons:
Put in a notice about vandalism (such as is done on Chuck Norris, which is also, at present, semi-protected), or when the same mistake is made by many users,
Automated bots sometimes also """"remove"""" an image by enclosing it in comments, when the image may be added incorrectly.
In rare cases, text additions are put in comments so that other editors can see them, before the material is added to the article properly.  This is usually a bad use of the comments, since it makes things confusing to edit.
They often appear at the end of semi-automated template messages, to indicate which message was used (that is where the """"Template:Unsigned"""").  So, for instance, I wrote {{subst:unsigned|00 tux}}, and the unsigned template was added.

Political question?
I not sure if this is """"political;"""" and in fact, I'm hoping it is not ....  

At WP:AN/I, you suggested a """"fresh start"""" in the context of a discussion I have not followed.  My interest is only in that term  where did it come from?  This term does not appear to be associated with any Wikipedia conventions.  Fresh start (an anti-Maastricht Treaty group within the British Conservative Party opposed to the Maastricht Treaty) and Fresh Start (detergent) (a  Colgate-Palmolive laundry product) are unrelated.  If it's just a term you've introduced in this unique setting and nowhere else, fine.  I just wondered.

I attempted to use a similar concept in a military-related setting  at Talk:Hyūga helicopter destroyer#RESET, but it fell on deaf ears.  In retrospect, it seems likely that it would have made no difference if there had been a pre-existing link to Reset (military term); but perhaps it may make a difference in future.  

The political question has to do with this military term.  How do """"depoliticize"""" the article I'm about to create.  It seems likely that there may be numbers of editors and users for whom American military terminology becomes a priori political before it's even possible to reach the content threshold which implies something like your """"fresh start?""""  

As a general rule, most of the new Wikipedia articles I've created have to do with pre-Meiji Japan, and this odd, overly-sensitive hesitation simply doesn't arise.  However, I'm not unaware of those critical voices on the francophone internet decrying the American bias in the World Wide Web; and I've noticed similar comments across a range of English-language Wikipedia articles.  Other than searching for British and Commonwealth military specialists in an effort to discover a congruent British and commonwealth term, can you think of something off-hand which might be relevant in creating an article which would have broader usefulness in Wikipedia contexts like you yourself created?

A further point: I really like the term """"fresh start""""  not as much as """"reset"""".  Can you foresee any reason why I shouldn't re-name the article about the British activists in the 80's as Fresh Start (British politics).  This would leave something like """"your"""" fresh start in the primary position.  

Final question: When I noticed your sub-heading, my first-blush plan was to create """"Fresh start"""" as a re-direct page; but now that I think about it, maybe the perceived """"political"""" problems with an article about an American military term would be diminished if the article itself were entitled """"Fresh start""""  with """"Reset"""" as a re-direct page?

You would also have utmost contempt for someone who makes up lies, false accusations, and slander about JWs and their books, especially if they had never even read a single JW publication and yet they posted masses of negative claims about them, just like you have about Raymond Franz. YOU Danny Muse, are in NO position to speak, as you have not even read a single book by Raymond Franz, and so have completely and permanently revoked your right to speak, edit, or comment on the matter, of which you have admitted ZERO knowledge about him, his motives, his life or about his books and their Wikepedia entries, which you have the audacity to claim are """"inaccurate"""", and yet you have zero basis for this false claim, but you still cling to it like a rabid Pit bull.

9dbd8d8a25e1fba8,"""== Article flagged - could use a photo of a pit bull in attack mode ==

Before we get into discussing this article there is some background information that everyone needs to understand. First,statistically, pit bulls are less agressive (naturally) than, beagles, german shepards and other breeds. Secondly, the dogs only want to please their owners, that is why if you watch the [disgusting] videos of dog fighting you will see 90% of the dogs are wagging their tails because they hear their owner(s) encouraging them to fight. A perfect example is the Michael Vick case, his dogs were taken and put into kennels, as per a federal jury they were not killed because of the [high] profile of the case. Out of the 66 dogs there were taken 8 were put down; which means that is only 12%. Out of the other 58 dogs they have all been adopted to families along with being trained for hospice and hospitals to help raise self esteems on patients. The best saying to sum up the Pit Bull breed is too """"Blame the Deed NOT the Breed"""" which means dont classify ALL pitbulls as fighting agressvie dogs, just the one's that are beaten and treated like crap by the owners and bred for fighting. Pit bulls are NOT agressive by nature. If you look at american history we used to LOVE Pit Bulls, I mean there was Petey (little rascals) and betty boop had a pitbull. Plus many other famous actors/actresses.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

The article discusses at length the dangerous nature of pit bulls, but lacks a picture of a pit bull attacking or behaving aggressively. The photo of a muzzled pit bull is a start, but is insufficient. I realize it may not be easy to obtain a such a photo in the public domain or by permission, but I'm adding a request in any case.   

 Why does the article need that? Any dog breed can attack.  There's nothing special about the way that a bully breed attacks. The muzzle image is fine; it illustrates that fact that some bully breed individuals do have aggression tendencies which need to be addressed if the dog is in public.  Talk 

 A photo of an agressive dog would be better suited for a dog fighting article.  To place a photo of an aggressive dog in an article describing a breed would be similar to using a photo of a soldier shooting an enemy during war on the Human article...  Or a Jew in a concentration camp, or I suppose a photo of a mugging would compare to animal aggression, but those wouldn't be true to Human character would they?   

Isn't a photo of a muzzled dog more relevant to a discussion of dog muzzling laws? Some places, such as some public parks, require all dogs to be muzzled while attending, regardless of breed, so a photo of a muzzled dog can have different interpretations. As I wrote in my first post, for an article that discusses pit bull attacks, an illustration of such would not be improper to accompany the text. Wikipedia:Images: """"Images must be relevant to the article they appear in and be significantly relative to the article's topic."""" Here are a couple of news media stories that felt it appropriate to use such images: http://www.ktul.com/news/stories/0108/485244.html and http://dallasmorningviewsblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2008/02/mandatory-confi.html. Perhaps a pit bull owner out there would be proud to have such an image of their guard dog in attack mode displayed in the article or perhaps a kennel owner or victim of an attack was able to snap a photo that they would donate and upload to Wikipedia Commons. I remember there used to be a photo of a """"smiling pit bull"""" in the article (see archive Nov 1, 2007). We could return that in the positive press section at the same time to maintain balance.   

A single screenshot image could also be obtained from a television news report about pit bulls and included under fair use. Research: Wikipedia:Image_copyright_tags/Non-free_content and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template:Non-free_television_screenshot Template:Non-free_tele",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi, as it stands, the first paragraph begins with

  """"The history of Japan probably started around 100,000 BCE""""

I'd like to point out that perhaps it's not useful or accurate to start a history article with a date 100000 BCE like this...  The reason why, in general, is that the study of history is typically restricted to the era of 'written records', as the Wikipedia article on """"History"""" will even state.  There can be probably some fudging, because written records can date slightly earlier events or have relation to slightly earlier events.  In short, history and pre-history will be divided by written records.

Please take a look at the wikipedia article on History of England, in that, the upper-right table indicates prehistory is before 43 BC, and history in the years after.  This date of 43 BC is generally due to Roman era records.  And again, (somewhere geographicaly closer to Japan) in the article History of China, the article begins by saying that """"The history of China is detailed by historical records dating back to 1500 BC"""". 

I think it's a bit problematic and misleading to state that history began 100,000 years ago, because if by history you mean purely archaeological evidence, then why stop there?  History will blend right into pre-history, and then into archaeology, without any meaningful demarcation.  

There is the more casual usage of the word 'history', of course.  That is, history is just the sequence of all events from beginning to end.  In which case, the history of Japan goes back to the Big Bang and all time afterward.  But as an informative and scholarly Wikipedia entry, I think this article should be amended with something more accurate, more specific, referring to what is canonically defined as """"history"""".

I propose something like 

""""The earliest records of Japan date back to 600 B.C.E., according to the Chinese source commonly known as the  Gishiwajinden, or the Chronicles of the Three Kingdoms.  In the text, the country of Yamataikoku is mentioned, which was said to be ruled by the Queen Himiko.""""

I think this adds to the quality of the article in its specificity, and in exposing the reader to the Himiko story.  Even here, there is lots of controversy as to whether Yamataikoku even existed because of lack of archaeological evidence.  The idea that we have any idea of the specific events of 100,000 BCE, as the word 'history' demands, is somewhat unreasonable.  Any comments?

As I've already said, there was a similar drop in Putin's popularity before the 2004 elections, so that's not a new story. Reflecting in the lead every up and down in Putin's ratings is a heavy WP:RECENTISM and WP:Undue weight. Also, as was already said in the discussions above, there are different explanations to the booing story - reflecting them all means putting too much weight to this trivial event, while not reflecting them means non-neutral coverage. At the same event Putin was applauded, and it is not clear who was the person the booing was directed at. It's a sign of bias and yellow press style, and it's quite a pity that BBC and likes put so much attention to this episode. Note that Putin's popularity started decline before that event, and while I don't know the latest opinion polls, it is clear that if the popularity goes up that would be against the theory that that episode was somehow significant, while if the popularity goes down, that would be likely connected to the elections story rather than to some trivial episodes.

Appreciate the question, however I am not qualified to answer it. I live in Michigan, but do spend the winters in the Myrtle Beach area. I have been doing this (off and on ) for over 20 years. I often go to Atalaya Castle and Brookgreen Gardens - but basically for the enjoyment and taking pictures. I know little of the history of these places, other than what is in the brochures given out by the state. All the pictures at Brookgreen Gardens is mine - including at the bottom a slide show presentation of additional pictures. All the pictures at Commons are also mine. All the pictures at Atalaya Castle are also mine, except for the B & W one. Also recently I added a slide show presentation at the bottom of the group of pictures of additional pictures I took in 2006. Do these slide show presentations work for you? I have checked them on various computers at various locations and they appear to work properly (especially of the high speed connections). Sorry I couldn't help more. I think probably your best bet is others that edit these articles, especially the ones that started them (if they are still around). There is an article on Huntington Beach State Park which I have edited, however basically from a formating """"clean up"""" standpoint (removing peacock terms). Notice they are requesting additional photos of HBSP, so will have to go take some and enter into the article. Maybe even make a slide show. What do you think of this idea of a """"slide show"""" of pictures? Should they be narrated or is classical music alright? How about amateur home movies of places like this? BTY, Atalya Castle is directly across Highway 17 from Brookgreen Gardens. Brookgreen Gardens is about a mile directly inland. In the slide show of Atalaya the first slide shows the original road going directly from the residence of Atalaya Castle to Brookgreen Gardens as the Huntingtons would have used it in the 1930's to move the large sculptures. Since, Highway 17 was built and has cut it in half. All this property was then owned by the Huntingtons.  talk """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park) 

Hi there, in regards to Soviet War Memorial (Treptower Park), please do not re-insert that information into the article, as it fails verification. The source which was used states:

The rape of Germany left a bitter legacy. It contributed to the unpopularity of the East German communist regime and its consequent reliance on the Stasi secret police. The victims themselves were permanently traumatised: women of the wartime generation still refer to the Red Army war memorial in Berlin as """"the Tomb of the Unknown Rapist"""".

It does not state WHICH memorial, and the inclusion in this article represents original research. As a Berliner, you know there are 3 Soviet war memorials, and throwing random epitaphs into articles based upon ones guess is not encyclopaedic. There is also evidence that people have not cited the other sources, and if they keep pushing the line that they have cited the material, and reinsert it into the article, I will present evidence which proves that 1) they have not read the material at all or 2) have blatantly falsified the references for inclusion into the article, and I will be asking for sanctions against anyone who reinserts it. This has been raised on the talk page, and editors have refused to provide cites from those sources. As there is also evidence of some of these editors also engaging in original research by placing into articles things which are not mentioned in those sources, this is egregious original research, and given the nature of the information inserted, it can be seen as a blatant breach of WP:DIGWUREN.

Infoboxes have their limitations.  This is one of them.  Have another look at my post to the talk page; your input appears to be sincere yet also has missed nearly all of the referenced points I was making:
In the post-Reconstruction, pre-WWI United States, the """"N-word"""" was far less transgressive than it is today.
That particular word has undergone such a dramatic reduction in social acceptability that it must be presented within context, if at all.
This isn't because of the word's offensiveness to modern sensibilities per se; it's because twenty-first century readers would not understand its use as a nickname for a white man and would have no point of reference for how it would become a badge of honor to him.  Context must be provided or else it is shocking and misleading rather than informative.
It may not be possible or necessary to contextualize that moniker adequately within the bounds of WP:NPOV, specifically WP:UNDUE.  The nickname is a minor part of Pershing's life and career.  A similar nickname in Irving Berlin's biographical background has more than twice the returns on Google Books, yet is not mentioned in his Wikipedia biography.

There isn't really an easy way to do this. I generally use a combination of Illustrator CS and a text editor, and any knowledge on basic SVG specifications for basic types (such as default parameter values, so that certain data can be excluded). I used to use Inkscape, but it felt too clunky and produces really bloated SVG code—it is sad to say (since I support free software) that I really appreciate Illustrator, since it is slick and produces very clean SVG code. Certainly, Adobe authored the SVG specifications, so it is not surprising that Illustrator writes the best output (in my opinion). However, when opening SVG files in Illustrator that were originally saved in the Inscape SVG format, Illustrator will usually retain the """"sodipodi"""" metadata, which is specific only to that application (and Inkscape). I try to remove the sodipodi data using a text editor to keep the code to the standard SVG coding, then reopen/save in Illustrator. Another method is to save the figure as an Illustrator AI or PDF file, then reopen/save in Illustrator again to shed the sodipodi metadata. If this fails, and it is a simple circle, I redraw the object. Often I'll name objects, but remove """"Layer 1"""", since multiple layers are not needed for logos. If you can, find original artwork in PDF format, and simply open it up in Illustrator, and edit then save in SVG.

In real life, people like Bill Gunston would always check and recheck their information prior to the publication of his article and/or book, he has help from other editor giving peer review. So why can't you accept this logically like a man instead of trying to bulldoze your way through the plain view of so many of us here? FWIW, I think I speak for everyone here when I say that we don't need your input if you carry on with your pointy behaviour. One, you are not Bill Gunston; two, your level of proficiency in English language leaves a lot to be desired; three, your reference source is very questionable (per WP:Verifiability#Self-published sources); four, you dislike getting help from other editors when they are obviously trying to help, preferring to bulldoze instead; and lastly, MB1 made it very clear that you have trouble understanding Wikipedia's editing guidelines and policies even though you meant well, you have somehow managed to offend everyone here for god-knows-what reason. Try to see things first from our point of view when you want others to understand yours. Capisce?  ♠♣♥♦™№1185©♪♫® """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Regarding the writer at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Hitler_salute
    Mr Barlow is a nutter with an obsession. The history of the salute is now improved in the Roman salute article (which had many previous visits from Dr. Curry in the past - see its talk page). The pact between the National Socialist German Workers' Party and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is not well known, and is also not covered widely on Wikipedia, so it is """"covered up"""" by people and also people often refer to it as the """"Nazi-Soviet"""" pact (as the writer above does) which avoids ever using the actual name of the horrid Party (the National Socialist German Workers' Party) and reinforces the hackneyed use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" and the myth that members of the National Socialist German Workers' Party referred to themselves as """"Nazis"""" (they did not refer to themselves as """"Nazis"""").  Some people (note the writer above) try to evade the point with odd comments such as """"It wasn't invented by Wikipedia editors to conceal the word 'socialism'!""""  That comment does not dispute the fact that there are people who use the word """"Nazi"""" to avoid ever stating the actual name of the party: The National Socialist German Workers' Party. Not only is that done in the title of the page cited (the Nazi-Soviet pact page) it is done on that entire article where the actual name of the Party never appears nor even the phrase """"National Socialist."""" The writer above also makes constant use of the shorthand """"Nazi"""" even when discussing the very topic at hand.  The Bellamy salute was not originally the same as the salute of the National Socialist German Workers' Party, as noted by Professor Curry. However, as anyone who looks at Dr. Curry's historic photographs of the salute can see, it developed into the same salute as that of the National Socialist German Workers' Party. Even the writer above concedes Dr. Curry's point that the flag was saluted with a normal military-style salute and then the arm was straightened out toward the flag during the oath. The writer above tellingly evades the point that the use of the military salute led to the change in the salute to the U.S. flag.  It is as if the writer above is conceding the point made. Indeed, the writer seems to concede it with the comment """"Anyway, even if the gesture had been the same, so what? It's just a gesture. The Soviets used conventional salutes, does that mean that the US military are Communists because they use the same gesture as the Soviet military!""""   It is fascinating how the writer again avoids the actual name """"Union of Soviet Socialist Republics"""" and also used the term """"Communist"""" instead of using the term """"Socialist.""""  The writer then attempts to avoid the issue, which is the origin of the straight-arm salute, and tries to turn the issue into an odd argument about whether the salutes dictated particular dogmas.  Nevertheless, the writer evades the topic that Professor Curry has raised, which is that Francis Bellamy and Edward Bellamy were  self-proclaimed National Socialists in the USA three decades before the National Socialist German Workers' Party, and Edward's book was an international bestseller, translated into every major language (including German, which Edward spoke and wrote, and where Edward had studied as a young man) and that Edward's dogma inspired """"Nationalism"""" clubs worldwide including in Germany. 

    Yes, the """"Roman salute"""" page did once contain innaccuracies, and the writer above is to be thanked for conceding that point. But that is no reason for the writer to start going on with his use of the term """"conspiracy."""" It's just what you get when you have an open encyclopedia! The point is to correct error when you see it, and to not delete those corrections when they are made by people like Dr. Curry.  

    The writer above also concedes that he is the Wikipedia editor who """"became wiser"""", by incorporating Professor Curry's discoveries.  The writer is to be thanked for crediting Dr. Curry with making it more widely available. It should be noted that the valuable information that Professor Curry provides is his own discovery.  Dr. Curry has also mentioned that the material about the use of the Roman salute in films derives from an academic article by Martin Winkler. Professor Curry pointed out that Martin Winkler did not realize at the time of Winkler's article that the films were all pre-dated by the use of the salute in the U.S. Pledge of Allegiance.  Dr. Curry has also publicly challenged Martin Winkler to debate these issues.  Professor Curry's discovery that the swastika/hakenkreuz, although an ancient symbol, was sometimes used by the National Socialist German Workers' Party as """"S"""" shapes standing for its """"Socialism"""" is also his own original work. And he is right that other writers have deliberately covered up the discovery (as the writer above admits) and have excluded it from the Swa",0,0,0,0,0,0

 The Indigenous Peoples of North America PortalThe Indigenous Peoples of North America Portal has been established, as a starting point for those wishing to learn more about the subject, with information and links on a wide variety of issues. It also contains news regarding the continent's various tribes and nations. It's a graphically pleasing site, and everyone is encouraged to check it out. Home Page Reorganization The project's home page has a new design, featuring tabbed subpages on participants, templates, articles, categories, and the to do list. Article Classification MoveThe Article Classification lists have been moved to their own subpage due to size. This is a sign of progress in the ongoing work of this project. New Talk Page Template The project's talk page template has been updated, along with the classification system, to include the assessment on the talk pages of the articles that have been classified and assessed.

As the Project reaches its first six months of activity, the great effort all of you have invested in it has turned the vast information available on Indigenous North American topics from a deorganized cumulous into an excellent and easy to consult database. Although much work is still in order, few WikiProjects are able to obtain the amazing results we are proud to show today. To all of you, thank you and congratulations!

The grammar has been updated

I took the time to update the grammar and rearrange some of the sentence structure. One person took the time to point out a """"General Discussion"""" web forum that is definitely not official, but I did not delete that information, like I probably should have. Instead, I simply pointed out that Midway's highest ranking authoritytheir CEOhas officially confirmed that Midway will Publish Unreal Tournament 2007 for the Xbox 360. Although Epic currently does not acknowledge that they are developing an Xbox 360 version of Unreal Tournament 2007, that definitely does not prevent Midway from Publishing the game for the Xbox 360. 

Midway could easily develop the game for the Xbox 360 on their own, or they could outsource the development to another developer. Let's not forget that the PC is the primary development platform for Unreal Tournament 2007. Midway or an outsourced developer could easily port the game to the Xbox 360 because the Xbox 360 is so easy to program games for, since it is so similar to the PC. However, the Playstation 3 is very difficult to develop games for, and it likely requires skilled developers such as Epic to work on both the PC and PS3 versions at the same time. Nevertheless, the bottom line is that Midway CEO David Zucker has made it 100% clear that Midway will Publish Unreal Tournament 2007 for the Xbox 360, regardless of who the Developer of the game is.

 Speedy Deletion of """"Girl Power (Video)""""  

Hello, 

I recently established a page for Sadie Benning's video """"Girl Power"""". I've been notified that the page was challenged for its presumed insignificance (not enough """"notability""""). Considering the fact that feminist artists have been excluded from the mainstream art establishment and essentially omitted from history, I understand why one might thing a page dedicated to one of Sadie Benning's video MIGHT NOT have """"enough notability"""". However, I would easily respond by mentioning that ALL of Sadie Benning's video, ESPECIALLY her video """"Girl Power"""", played a pivotal role in the formation of Girl Power as a concept, radical feminist politics, and the Riot grrrl's commitment to the child icon. This video has been discussed amongst scholars and academics who focus on everything from art history to gender studies and from new media studies to sociology. If Wikipedia is supposed to be an encyclopedic database that indexes """"notable"""" historical and current events, then it would only make sense to include a page on this highly influential work that has greatly contributed to the emergence of feminist 90s politics and art. Any attempts to delete this page will be excluding important information about a widely-acclaimed video that has ONLY been excluded from historical documentation databases because of the artist's sex.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Contested deletion 

This page is not unambiguously promotional, because... (your reason here)   

FWIW I haven't worked at the company for over 8 years, I originally created the page to contribute to Wikipedia on a subject which, at the time, I knew about.  I don't know how accurate what is written is at the moment as I haven't followed it, but I know the company does still exist as I have a friend who still works there.  While I agree the wording of the opening 2 sentences at the moment do now come across a bit 'marketing-ey' (I'm guessing someone has edited since it was created), as a Wikipedia user I'd find it stranger a big company wouldn't have a page on Wikipedia than that the page had some marketing speak.

180d069a8d003ccc,"Comment - 'Station' as a word essentially means 'a fixed point'.  I'm not sure of the exact definition in the past, but it pre-dates railways by several centuries.  'Battle stations' as a term dates back some considerable way, and naval vessels in their correct patrol areas were said to be 'on station' in Nelson's time.  I believe it is derived from a Latin word meaning 'still' (i.e. 'stationary').  'Railway station' as a term goes back at least as far as 1825, while 'train station' was not recorded for over a century after that, nor were 'petrol station', 'power station' or 'bus station'.  One important consideration is how widespread a term is.  Is it a 'railway station' in Australia, India, South Africa or any other country where the British built the railways?  Finally, the term 'train' may be incorrect when referring to modern passenger railway vehicles.  Under some definitions, trains are exclusively loco-hauled or push-pull.  Most modern passenger vehicles are multiple units, and thus not 'trains' under these definitions, because there is no locomotive.128.240.229.3",0,0,0,0,0,0

speaking of bad faith...
Reverting edits made in good faith immediately after they are made is irritating and hostile to collaboration. Especially when you obviously don't take the time to consider their reasons. Please explain to me why this quote:
""""The Executive Branch shall construe [the torture ban] in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary Executive Branch and as Commander in Chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power.""""
Needs to be included in addition to (and immediately following) this quote:
 The executive branch shall construe Title X in Division A of the Act, relating to detainees, in a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the President to supervise the unitary executive branch and as Commander in Chief and consistent with the constitutional limitations on the judicial power, which will assist in achieving the shared objective of the Congress and the President, evidenced in Title X, of protecting the American people from further terrorist attacks. Further, in light of the principles enunciated by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2001 in Alexander v. Sandoval, and noting that the text and structure of Title X do not create a private right of action to enforce Title X, the executive branch shall construe Title X not to create a private right of action. Finally, given the decision of the Congress reflected in subsections 1005(e) and 1005(h) that the amendments made to section 2241 of title 28, United States Code, shall apply to past, present, and future actions, including applications for writs of habeas corpus, described in that section, and noting that section 1005 does not confer any constitutional right upon an alien detained abroad as an enemy combatant, the executive branch shall construe section 1005 to preclude the Federal courts from exercising subject matter jurisdiction over any existing or future action, including applications for writs of habeas corpus, described in section 1005.

I'm not talking about belief of majority. In fact I would presume a billion Muslims specifically state he did not claim to be God and many of other faiths would agree. I'm saying I don't think we have any facts to solidly state, by encyclopedia standards, whether Jesus claimed to be a god or not. You can object because it's unclear, but your statement """"he did not claim he was god"""" is merely your opinion. You really can't prove it. Considering the historical effect in least the concept he claimed to be god I think may make it relevant here, but I could see taking it off as disputed. Although if you want to get into it in many books I've read indicate Hong Xiuquan did not claim to be God either. He believed that Jesus was the Son of God, but not God. He had an Arian view of Jesus and of his own role as """"Son of God."""" Although I added her it sounds possible that this MITA woman only believed she contained the Holy Spirit rather then """"was the Holy Spirit."""" Yet you don't object on those or ones that may even be more debatable. In least in the case of Jesus the idea he claimed to be God is the mainstream belief of his followers and the existent writing on him. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Not everyone believes this crap, copied from AN/I
I do not know either John254 or Kristin Erikson and recently stumbled across this. But, I have to say this looks like a witch hunt with evidence that wouldn't even hold up as circumstantial. They can't prove they're not socks, so they must be. And any evidence to the contrary is more proof because it must have been deliberately planted. If we ban then and they drown, then they must have been innocent after all. Personally, I've been editing Wikipedia since the beginning (late 2001), both as an IP user and with an account that I have abandoned, so I fully understand KE appearing on Wikipedia knowing more than you think a new user """"""""should"""". I would bet that the vast majority (like 99%) of users spend some time editing as an IP user before they create an account  the only question is how long they spend that way. It looks like KE didn't bother creating an account until she found a need to do so. That not only is not wrong, it should be encouraged.
Like KE, I have also edited extensively as an IP. For the most part, I found no reason to create an account, but I created a new account recently with my real name and, of course, my new account appeared to be an expert about Wikipedia immediately. Like KE, I also dive deeply into things. Were you to accuse me of being John254's sock puppet, I would do the same that she did  dig into his edit history and compare it to mine to look for evidence to prove my innocence. Most of the contributors here have dug into KE's edit history and now may well know more about it than she does  are you therefore sock puppets too?
Suggesting that defending herself with evidence, against people who are accusing her with flimsy evidence, is ridiculous. And, to argue that she would have deliberately created arguments with herself and other contrary evidence, over a long period of time, just in case anybody ever complained is hard to believe.
At best, the evidence here looks like collusion, not sock puppetry, and I don't even see that. But, even so, there is no rule against collusion on Wikipedia. And we see it all the time, with people cooperating on edits. I personally have emailed people I know to suggest that they edit pages in which I had an interest. Doing so does not make them my sock puppet or vice versa, whether they agree with me or disagree with me. 
To me, this flimsy house of cards rush to judgment and assumption of guilt represents the very worst of Wikipedia, and I think that even if it turns out that they are witches (uh, sock puppets). And I, personally, do not believe it to be true after reading this and the information on KE's page.

The term """"emo"""" is thrown around so loosly and it's become a label that bands and other people see to be offended by, I don't think that it's necessary to state that in the article, especially since """"emo"""" has no real definition in the first place.

Do any of you think that someone should add a section specifically for """"Former Members"""" and then talk about the controversy involving whether the bass lines in the album were actually his or not? I don't like the fact that it's just bunched in with the current members with no explaination on the dismissal. 

 Wikiproject proposal 

I've proposed a Panic! at the Disco Wikiproject here, to see how many people would be interested before starting one. The project would be an effort by a group of Wikipedians to build and improve all Panic! at the Disco pages (including members of the band, songs and albums). If you think that you'd be reguarly editing these pages, please put your name down at this page so we can see who would be interested in the project. Thanks in advance- '  talk |  

many people believe that the band members may be homosexuals but as they said in one of there interviews on absoluterock they said they confirmed """"none of the band members are gay not that theres anything wrong with it""""-ryan ross

""""emo""""

Wouldn't things just be alot easier if people could all just agree on Panic! being emo? """"Emo"""" is basically this generation's """"grunge"""". Sure, the bands may not sound very similar to each other at all, but did Nirvana sound similar to Pearl Jam? No, not really. So just because Panic! and say, My Chemical Romance might not sound exactly similar that doesn't mean they can't be the same genre. And guess what- just because """"emo"""" bands hate being called that doesn't mean anything. """"Grunge"""" bands hated being called grunge too. 

And there definetly IS an emo sound. There's definetly a particular vocal style, lyrical style, and attitude that emo bands have.

Agreed, Panic! is an emo band, but many fans here seem to have a problem with that. 

A lot of people get really sensitive about things they like being labelled emo, I think it's just because the stereotypical emo isn't really something that a lot of people want to be associated with. I agree that the vocal style especially is emo, and the way they look is also associated with emo- not all songs, but some songs of theirs have 'emo-ish' lyrics, too. I'm fine with the genre being changed, it's just a matter of fans researching them here and becoming offended- instead of discussing it here, it's going to be changed back a lot. However, on the page it's set as emo and alternative rock, which is perfect. '  talk |

       I've been liking Fall Out Boy and Panic since last June. I heard that Pete(Wentz) and Brendon Eurie are switching roles( if you know what I mean). If the rumor is true, it would be very nice to hear Pete sing for P!ATD and Brendon play bass for FOB.

Notability of MR.King Of Fighters
A tag has been placed on MR.King Of Fighters, requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion. To do this, add  on the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag) and leave a note on the article's talk page explaining your position.

 Copyvios 

Hi Ram.  I patrol new pages and often run into new articles that contain copyright violations.  Recently, I've found 4 or 5 of them that were created by students in your program.  Obviously WP will react according to policy regarding copyvios but I was wondering if you would like me to notify you or anyone else when I find that an article created for your course contains a copyright violation.  If you or your program as a whole care to be informed, I was thinking I could either leave a message on your talk page or on the talk page of the course.  I think the ambassador project and these courses are really neat and the best way I can think to help is to lend my most used WP skills to assist.  If there's any way reviewing new pages can help you, the ambassador program, or any of your courses, please let me know. ''''''Talktome """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Just for reference, there's nothing wrong with citing non-English sources as long as they satisfy WP:RS, but if you do then it's sometimes helpful to provide a brief translation of the relevant section per WP:RSUE. This can be added to the citation template using the  parameter (See Template:Cite web#Quote). Translations do not have to be professional quality; They just have to be sufficient enough for the reader to understand how the cited source supports what is written in the article. 
Regarding COI, you are considered to have a conflict of interest because you have stated you are an employee of the museum at User talk:Materialscientist#Ottoneum. That doesn't mean you can never edit the article, but it does mean there are certain limitations placed the type of edits which are considered OK for you to make. COI editing is not expressly prohibited, but it can be a bit tricky to do so it is something which is highly discouraged. It might be a good idea for you to take a look at WP:PSCOI to see what these kinds of edits are. Of course, what you know about the museum is true, but what can be verified through independent reliable sources matters more to Wikipedia than what we may personally know about a particular subject. The information on the museum's official website is considered to be a primary source, so it's usage is rather limited. Wikipedia articles are not really supposed to reflect what a source says about itself or what those connected to the source say about it; Rather, articles are supposed to reflect what independent reliable sources say about something. So, any sources you can find which discuss the museum and are independent of it would be helpful.",0,0,0,0,0,0

dfbe0e7ea4a8a51b,"Tom, supply and demand are not the same.  They intersect to create price.  If demand is high and supply is low, price is high... etc.  Petroleum can be stored in many places, such as in the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (727 million barrels).  Global strategic petroleum reserves hold over 4 billion barrels.  Supply, which is the refined petroleum (and other liquids) available in the open market, is affected by releases of strategic reserves (note that production is not the same as supply).  Depending on the source you read demand and usage might not even be the same thing, as demand might include buyers for strategic reserves.  

Most of the big issues with Peak oil begin with the fact that until recently demand has grown very steadily for a long time, catching up with production.  When production can not go up anymore (and begins to decline), the strategic reserves will slowly be used up until supply also begins to decline.  Then usage will be forced to decline, but demand could theoretically keep going up (imagine a room with one cupcake, full of people yelling for more).  I hope this helps... let me know if part of this is confusing.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Criticisms of an Innately Modular Mind 

Many of the criticisms of EP have to do with their belief that nature selected a mind characterized by innately pre-specified domain-specific information-processing modules that were adapted to solve specific problems within our Pleistocene past. This section was intended to include criticisms of their 'massively' or even 'mostly-massively' assumptions with regard to modularity. However, the 'rebuttals' seem aimed, not toward defending their position, but toward attacking an entirely domain-general version of the mind. Firstly, this kind of structure does not address the criticisms pertaining to the EP position, and are thus not 'true' rebuttals to these criticisms. Secondly, it creates a false-dichotomy and strawman presentation of the critics, suggesting that the only other 'alternative' to the EP definition of the mind is an entirely domain-general one. 

My suggestion, is to either cut these kinds of rebuttals, or to add a separate section beneath it titled: """"Criticisms of the Domain-General Model of Mind."""" Let us describe EPers fighting their strawmen in a separate section.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Fixing Assange and resistance: I have preferences set to show cache pages, but """"Assange"""" also took """"18.002 secs"""" (not 0.250) for me to access, obviously bypassing cache but not edited in 3 hours, while other articles showed cache-page copies. That's another performance shock for me: one article bypasses cache. I cleared my entire browser cache, and then Assange showed the cache-page copy. As for broad resistance, the Continuous Improvement movement (Kaizen, etc.) has warned, """"People dislike change"""". Most act like the """"boiling frog"""" and sit while the temperature rises, never moving until too late and """"Beyonce"""" runs 26 seconds (or Assange 18). I advised Jimbo, to add """"More pillars"""" where Performance becomes a major priority, like Civility or NPOV, rather than """"personal preference to see results"""" in the same hour, while they demand the cite-tools still work. You might know I've had severe rejections trying to defuse essay wp:PERF, and explain how the Titanic sank because """"Don't worry"""" thwarted other people from acting or improving (the ship design included ample lifeboats rejected by others). This year, with the Costa Concordia in Italy, passengers worried enough about the tilting ship to call land-based police to complain the ship seemed damaged while crew pretended """"Don't worry"""". Enough. I think we are reaching """"critical mass"""" to move forward here. The next compromise consensus supports all parameters (as demanded pronto), and auto-runs the quick citations, with later promises to """"fix"""" {Citation/core} where possible, and still support those cite-tools which generate {cite_web} calls and such. It is a hideously complex upgrade, with over 23 forks as {cite_book}, {cite_video}, {cite_document}, {cite_press_release}, {cite_encyclopedia}, even """"{citeweb}"""" or """"{cite web}"""" but fixing the most-used will cure the speed problems. Plus, the talk-page already warns to deprecate """"surname1"""" for """"last1"""" where 3 fewer alias parameters could mean 2x faster for that parameter, perhaps next year. Beyond the complex fast {Fcite} templates, the rapid {cite_quick} runs 10x-12x faster, so """"Assange"""" can drop from 18 to 5-second edit-preview. I already saved some temporary revisions to """"prove"""" Assange can reformat in 5 seconds:

And at least one animal on the table you keep removing is, in my opinion, pretty clearly a domesticated animal (considering how many morphs of leopard geckos have been bred).  Some of the animals on that table may not belong there, I kind of did a copypaste of a bunch that had been deleted from the first table, but at least some of them are possibly to probably domesticated, depending on what definition you use.  And if you leave them on the page, in the """"status unclear"""" table, then people will presumably stop adding them to the main table, which gets rid of the truly frustrating """"Hey, why isn't (foo) on this table?""""

 Use as a mascot/nickname? 

The use of the binturong as a mascot and/or nickname for schools and sports teams is relatively dubious.

SchroCat is applying the general rule in British English, that is when """"out"""" is prefixed to a noun or verb it is usually hyphenated, and is correct in the case of """"pre-arrange"""", which is hyphenated in the OED.

My Reverting of The Edit In The History Section
I didn't revert the edit because the material you removed isn't redundant in some ways, which is fairly obvious if you read the  section as a whole. The entire history section of this article is still in very bad shape in my opinion, I'd suggest that its got non NPOV issues in several spots, the tone it's written in and choice of words seem somewhat """"chatty"""" and unencyclopedic to me and worst of all it continues to contain, what I'd argue, are historical inaccuracies in some places. Instead of editing out the paragraph that was removed today, which contained a link to a map, as well as an internal link to the ongoing Caledonia land dispute, a subject quite relevant in the Grand Valley these days, I'd like to see the entire history section itself brought up to a higher standard. In my opinion, from a historical perspective, the article itself would benefit more if some of the earlier comments in it regarding the acquisition of the land by the Six Nations were edited out and replaced by the material that was removed today. As I said back in August, I'm willing to work on this article myself as time allows, but in my opinion it doesn't make sense removing content that's not only relevant and contains references, it's actually of a higher quality than what remains.

The People on Rathlin were not Irish- they were the families of Sorley Boy McDonnell's followers. The Scottish clanchiefs had sent their families to Rathlin in the belief that they would be safe there. Drake had been hired to supervise the transport of John Norri's Troops to Rathlin, and then patrol the waters between Rathlin and the Mull of Kintyre to prevent the scots from sending reinforcements.

THE BEST THINGS HAVE BEEN CULMINATED 
Zeal to promote the common good, whether it be by devising anything ourselves, or revising that which hath been laboured 
by others, deserveth certainly much respect and esteem, but yet findeth but cold entertainment in the world.  It is welcomed 
with suspicion instead of love, and with emulation instead of thanks: and if there be any hole left for cavil to enter, (and 
cavil, if it do not find a hole, will make one) it is sure to be misconstrued, and in danger to be condemned.  This will easily 
be granted by as many as know story, or have any experience.  For, was there ever any-projected, that savoured any way of 
newness or renewing, but the same endured many a storm of gainsaying, or opposition?  A man would think that Civility, 
wholesome Laws, learning and eloquence, Synods, and Church-maintenance, (that we speak of no more things of this kind) 
should be as safe as a Sanctuary, and out of shot, as they say, that no man would lift up the heel, no, nor dog move his 
tongue against the motioners of them. For by the first, we are distinguished from brute beasts lead with sensuality; By the 
second, we are bridled and restrained from outrageous behaviour, and from doing of injuries, whether by fraud or by 
violence; By the third, we are enabled to inform and reform others, by the light and feeling that we have attained unto 
ourselves; Briefly, by the fourth being brought together to a parley face to face, we sooner compose our differences than by 
writings which are endless; And lastly, that the Church be sufficiently provided for, is so agreeable to good reason and 
conscience, that those mothers are holden to be less cruel, that kill their children as soon as they are born, than those nursing 
fathers and mothers (wheresoever they be) that withdraw from them who hang upon their breasts (and upon whose breasts 
again themselves do hang to receive the Spiritual and sincere milk of the word) livelihood and support fit for their estates. 
Thus it is apparent, that these things which we speak of, are of most necessary use, and therefore, that none, either without 
absurdity can speak against them, or without note of wickedness can spurn against them. 
Yet for all that, the learned know that certain worthy men [Anacharsis with others] have been brought to untimely death for 
none other fault, but for seeking to reduce their Countrymen to god order and discipline; and that in some Commonwealths 
[e.g. Locri] it was made a capital crime, once to motion the making of a new Law for the abrogating of an old, though the 
same were most pernicious; And that certain [Cato the elder], which would be counted pillars of the State, and patterns of 
Virtue and Prudence, could not be brought for a long time to give way to good Letters and refined speech, but bare 
themselves as averse from them, as from rocks or boxes of poison; And fourthly, that he was no babe, but a great clerk 
[Gregory the Divine], that gave forth (and in writing to remain to posterity) in passion peradventure, but yet he gave forth, 
that he had not seen any profit to come by any Synod, or meeting of the Clergy, but rather the contrary; And lastly, against 
Church-maintenance and allowance, in such sort, as the Ambassadors and messengers of the great King of Kings should be 
furnished, it is not unknown what a fiction or fable (so it is esteemed, and for no better by the reporter himself [Nauclerus], 
though superstitious) was devised; Namely, that at such a time as the professors and teachers of Christianity in the Church of 
Rome, then a true Church, were liberally endowed, a voice forsooth was heard from heaven, saying:  Now is poison poured 
down into the Church, etc.  Thus not only as oft as we speak, as one saith, but also as oft as we do anything of note or 
consequence, we subject ourselves to everyone’s censure, and happy is he that is least tossed upon tongues; for utterly to 
escape the snatch of them it is impossible.  If any man conceit, that this is the lot and portion of the meaner sort only, and 
that Princes are privileged by their high estate, he is deceived.  """"As the sword devoureth as well one as the other,"""" as it is in

Thank you for advising me of this. Appreciated. I really do love Wikipedia but I must insist that I'm allowed to love it on my own terms because I can do no other (or go without, which I candidly admit is the fate of most of my love affairs oh dear ...).

As I think I must surely have made clear I really do have nothing further to add to the comments about 'Buddhist sex abuse cases' I have already made. I do hope the page is restored.

Currently I'm fleshing out the biographies of  Leveller women. I've already supplied a stub for Katherine Chidley and I'm presently working on one for User:Rinpoche/Mary Overton wife of Richard Overton. It will take a few days before it's ready yet.

Mary Overton was subjected to appalling abuse at one point in her life. She was nursing her new born baby when baillifs came to escort her to Millwall prison in London,an absolutely dreadful place. She refused so the bailiffs then called for some carters to take her away. They too refused out of common humanity. The bailffs then physically dragged her clutching her baby through the mire and dirt of the London streets while people spat abuse. 

Well I don't know but I think it quite possible that some of them went as far as telling her to 'go fuck yourself' which is absolutely frightful of course. 

The baby died some six months later.

Regarding the BSAC debacle what I've done with my Katherine Chidley stub is that on the talk page I've added at the top a section for contributors in which I myself, as a contributing editor, expressly ask people to contact me on my talk page if they have any issues with it; the lack of a definition for the term 'controversialist' for example which I can see might be a real no brainer for users of a certain disposition. I'll be doing the same in all future new pages I contribute in the hope of avoiding the same difficulties I had with BSAC (assuming of course that's okay with the wiki community).

Can you please explain your edits to Biff Rose? They appear to express a negative POV towards the person. - 06:55, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

 For willmcw 

I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!

Why do you delete the number of """"Carson"""" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. - 20:21, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

I've copied this discussion to the talk:Biff Rose page. - 23:29, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

 Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time  magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officially appeared on the show, and how many times he taped performances. He alleges, himself, that he appeared on the show 12 times. Producerss from the Tonight show remember him being on with much less regularity. Therefore, a distinction, to leave out embrassment, would be something like, """"Rose appeared with some level of regularity on the tonight show in the end of the decade."""" Of note> Rose was banned from any more performances on the Tonight Show because he refused to cut to a commercial break during his last performance, reciting a poem he often claimed as his own, which in fact was a poem by Paul Newman's uncle, Joseph Newman. This was chalked up to Rose's irrascible nature. I think it is important to notice to, the anger that first rears its head here, and then seems to pop up, on the record he did in 73, and beyond, to his later self released recordings where Rose is heard calling african americans niggers, and making fun of the jewish religion, citing Hit5ler as a genius, who clearly  had a vision. Willmcw is trying to keep the previous words someone else wrote about Rose being a child molester, which were clearly vandalism. I did not write that, and the anti semitic sentiments attributed to Rose are very easily found in his records and his websites. Willmcw is a vandal and works against my own edits in a nasty and un wiki fashion.

Your claim to an Oxford degree, no I'm sorry, two Oxford degrees - one in Political Science and the other in International Relations is contradicted first by your exchange with the original poster that corrected you on your calling the EU an NGO:
the EU is not a single nation, nor is the UN or UAE. They are actually something called NGO's, or non-governmental organizations. ... we do not link flags to NGO's. - 
 The EU is nothing BUT a governmental organization. Its purpose is to politically unite the countries within the European Community. it does not 'act on behalf' of any single state; it is a united entity. Ditto the UAE.. Kapowow 
Are you seriously trying to suggest that the EU is not an NGO? ... If you consider me throwing my political science and international relations degrees at you to be derogatory, then I have to say that I am sorry you feel that way. I am not a potted plant; I know the policies of which I speak, ... - 
''
It lacks all credence after this """"original"""" claim that somehow the word """"Penultimate's"""" meaning had """"evolved"""":
Regarding the 'penultimate' stuff - not worries - as I said, it's just a word. I always thought is was used as next to the end, as in right before the ending. A slightly different meaning has become popular, like how the original phrase """"buck naked"""" (meaning, naked as a male deer) becoming mispronounced so often that now people say """"butt-naked"""". It would render me a crabby old man to decry the loss of the word meanings. It was also make me something of a jerk. Words evolve. - Arcayne (cast a spell) 
 It has not. Your claim could be fully exposed for the fraud it is just by the lack of Oxford degrees in """"Poli Sci"""" or """"Int'l Relations"""". I personally am not fully conversant in Oxbridge minutia, but I do not believe Poli Sci exists as such there.75.57.205.135  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

  A 20 year monopoly on the American comic book industry is nothing to sneeze at.—yes, it is.  The focus of the article is on the comics medium, not on one tiny timespan of one tiny corner of the comics world.  The American comic book industry in the last twenty years is a tiny speck—in American comic books there's a whole long history that predates that, much of which is far more significant; the American comic strip industry has always been economically and historically larger; graphic novels have been taking over, and they've been growing outside the direct market and Diamond; and the American comics industry as a whole is dwarfed by those of Europe and Japan.  The Diamond monopoly is significant only to the American comic book industry of the last twenty years, and therefore merits mention in American comic book.  Outside of that article, it is unbalanced and irrelevant fluff.  It astounds me how you can't understand how ridiculously out of scope this is.  🍁 ¡gobble! """,0,0,0,0,0,0

This is very simplified but, generally speaking, the auditor examines the taxpayer's records (or other records) to determine the correct amounts of income, deductions, tax, etc. The auditor generally is not involved in trying to obtain the actual tax payment. At the IRS, the top people who work as auditors (or examiners) are called Revenue Agents.

The tax collector comes into the picture much later  after the amount of the tax has been determined. The collector isn't trying to determine the correct amount of tax; the collector is trying to obtain payment of the tax, or to seize assets to sell to satisfy the tax that the IRS claims is owed. At the IRS, the top people who work as tax collectors are called Revenue Officers.

If you compare Revenue Agents and Revenue Officers, a Revenue Agent (auditor) is likely to know more than a Revenue Officer (collector) knows about substantive federal tax law: what items are income, what items are not income, what expenses or other items are deductible, what items are not deductible, what credits are allowed, how the tax is properly computed, etc.

The Revenue Officer is likely to know more than a Revenue Agent knows about procedural federal tax law: how a federal tax lien arises; what things the IRS has to do to perfect the tax lien as against the taxpayer's other creditors, what rights the taxpayer to a hearing prior to seizure of assets, how to legally seize assets, what kinds of assets may be legally seized without a court order, what kinds of seizures require a court order, and so on.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks for your enlightenment. Unfortunately someone already taught me this fact a long time ago when I first ventured into this wikipedia ) Thanks anyway.

Simply reverting edits is counter-productive and against the etiquette of the Wikipedia.
I think this is your POV! There is a 'revert to previous page' button. May be your highness should dismantle it.

Commonly, we iterate until we can find language and fact statements that are acceptable to everyone. Notice that this iteration isn't a """"reversion war"""" - people discuss and change and adapt the article until consensus is reached.
Another POV again ) By the way - could you please enlighten me about who your 'we' refers to in all the above sentences?

Please explain why you are insisting on """"now called"""" in the Sikdar article, or, for that matter, why you are insisting on the mention of the name """"Sagarmatha"""". There may be a legitimate NPOV reason for the inclusion of both - without explanation, I am assuming that it is motivated by Hindu nationalism.

I must appreciate your exceptional ability to assume things. Fortunately, I am not a religious fanatic. But, I do know that provocative sentences like this fuel hatred and anger in the hearts of those groups you mentioned. Again I may be wrong. You know all ) But, I do feel that there is no 'present day sun' or 'present day moon'. That was the only impetus behind my editing it. Besides I also thought that there is nothing wrong in representing a fact (name 'sagarmatha'). Again you know all. 

My assumption very well may be incorrect, but no explanation of your reversion has been given. Convince me.
I confirm that your assumption is not only untrue but is provocative and preposterous. Sometimes even highly intelligent people like you do mistakes )

Note that the original name of Presidency College (in Calcutta, founded in 1817) was """"Hindoo College"""". Not """"Hindu"""" (as in the religion). Please stop reverting. It seems to me that if you insist on using one of the original names of Mount Everest, for consistency you must also use the original name of the college. Convince me otherwise.
As far as I could remember, I have been taught that the right spelling is Hindu, in India. Could you please let me know the difference between Hindoo and Hindu? By the way, could your highness ) please let me know how you assumed that I am an Hindu? I again appreciate your astrological prowess! Astrology is many a times fake - just fyi your highness )

I do not know why messages like this from people who know everything, makes me a little sad sometimes. I am envious of the brilliant people like you who can assume a boat load of stuff with just a two-line edit! 

We can continue this discussion at Talk:Radhanath Sikdar: that way, many people can participate.

Thanks for your attention. - hike395 03:35, 6 Jul 2004 (UTC)""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Sorry to take so long in replying, I've only had a small amount of WP time the last few days.  I see the point you are making, on the other hand it seems useful to say something about General Haftar's character given such a reputable source says something about it after consulting 20-odd people - which given FT's reputation you would think is a balanced representation of his contacts, but they do not say who they were. I agree the FT quote """"wasn’t well informed in politics"""" is very surprising given his position. I'm happy with you removing this, and will ponder if there is a better way to give the info.  FT registration is no-cost for a few articles a month, but here is a wider quote of what they said:

Even supporters acknowledge his political ambitions, suspecting he plans to anoint himself leader of the country’s liberals. The armed forces he now purports to lead are successors to the Gaddafi-era military he repeatedly turned against; the Islamist militias he is fighting are the ones with which he fought in the 2011 uprising. Many wonder whether he is a committed democrat, as he claims, or just another Arab military officer with dictatorial ambitions, in the mould of Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser, Syria’s Hafez Assad and Gaddafi.You need someone tough like Haftar to step up to the outlaws,” says the commentator Abdel Hamid el-Jadi. “He has experience in the Libyan military and he knows the tribes. If he has political ambitions we’ll deal with that in the second stage.”

But others worry about what they describe as a brittle personality and myopic worldview. Of nearly two- dozen people who have had dealings with him and spoke to the Financial Times, none could identify any of his interests outside war. In meetings with exiled opposition groups in the US and Africa, before he returned to serve as the rebel army’s chief of staff in the 2011 uprising, he spoke only of his military expertise. “He wasn’t well informed in politics, relationships between countries or cultures,” said one Gaddafi-era opposition activist.Many Libyans and international experts fear the offensive that Mr Haftar is co-ordinating could further destabilise the country. In televised appearances, he has a habit of conflating the Islamist militias with members of parliament and the government who belong to the Libyan Muslim Brotherhood, and with al-Qaeda.''

Hi Leszek Jańczuk.  After reviewing your request for rollback, I have enabled rollback on your account.  Keep in mind these things when going to use rollback:
Getting rollback is no more momentous than installing Twinkle.
Rollback should be used to revert clear cases of vandalism only, and not good faith edits.
Rollback should never be used to edit war.
If abused, rollback rights can be revoked.
Use common sense.
If you no longer want rollback, contact me and I'll remove it.  Also, for some more information on how to use rollback, see Wikipedia:New admin school/Rollback (even though you're not an admin).

Speedy deletion of Beverly Vergel

In any case Depardieu has not renounced French citizenship   
This article/reference disagrees with that: http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2251340/Adieu-France-Gerard-Depardieu-lands-Rome-renouncing-French-citizenship.html -  
 You shouldn't trust rags like The Daily Mail… (212.7.192.145  )
Seriously, i don't know why i even try. Next you know, all newspapers are """"rags"""" and diplomatic sources such as the Kremlin website are not reliable... Oh wait... We already went to that stage. -  
 As I explained above, the Daily Mail  - a notoriously unreliable English newspaper - 's article is from 20 December and is talking about the earlier controversy about Depardieu saying he was going to renounce French nationality.  It was impossible for this to be true since he did not have any other nationality to fall back on.    

Alledgely claims by Depardieu's Agent

Will the honourable gentleman behind IP 87.67.143.211 post ANY KIND OF SOURCE to back his claim, or will you just continue vandalizing the article and removing content and references? -  

Depardieu is a French actor having his legal residence in Belgium. That's all for the moment

1. France did not remove Depardieu's citizenship yet (otherwise, where is the source?).

2. Depardieu never applied for Russian citizenship.

3. Ask your Prof. of International Law (I did).

4. See here: http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/gesellschaft/filmstar-gerard-depardieu-von-putin-zum-russen-ernannt-a-875537.html): “Die Formulierung des Kreml, wonach Depardieu einen Antrag auf Einbürgerung gestellt hatte, wurde von einem Assistenten des Schauspielers dementiert.“

In English: The formulation of the Kremlin, that Depardieu had filed an application for naturalization, was denied by an assistant of the actor.

So yes: the Kremlin lied.

5. Lock this article once and for all for the rest of the month.

6. Ask yourself: If tomorrow, every country of the world offer Depardieu a passport, what do you do? Will you consider he's a Afghanisto-Albanio-Algerio-Andorro-Angolo-Antiguo-Barbudo-Argentino-Armenio-Australio-Austrio-Azerbaijo-Bahamo-Bahro-Banglado-Barbado-Belaro-Belgo-Belizo-Benino-Bhutano-Bolivio-………-Zambio-Zimbabwean actor?
This is nonsense. Putin thinking he's God doesn't rule out international law.

 Hello Alun, thank you for your contribution. Can I put two points to you, firstly in relation to editing against consensus, to answer """"yes"""" - it is possible to edit against consensus. People like me stand on my own two feet, stand up to scrutiny, stand up to debate and discussion, stand up to a weight of opinion against me and stand behind my name and only my name each time I weigh in with my opinion.

This is the reason why you can edit against consensus, because if there was a stipulation against it, the victim of the stipulation would employ the use of sockpuppets.

Dear Yiyu,

Don't work too much on the Mao article here  whatever you agree on will have no real strength behind it because you are not working with other editors, and when you polish something together, it will ultimately be destroyed by those that had no part in it.

You also need to watch out for what wikipedia calls """"weasel terms"""" that are used in the draft above.   """"weasel terms"""" are ways of saying thing that really avoid the issue.  If an editor says """"some analysts believe"""", it really means """"I don't know who believes it, but I want it in this article"""".

Unfortunately, the current wiki has no way to decide """"truth"""" and """"lies"""".   The best you can do is present all sides (not just one, or two) and cite evidence.     For everything that is a lie, you can add sentences describing why it is untrue.  There have been some movements to give weight to editors that are educated in one area more than those that are just shooting their mouths off, but they have failed.  As we all know, many times history has been distorted and many people have been fooled, so don't be too sure that you know what really happened, when all most of us really have are hand-me-down stories.

Lastly, be sure not to get too wrapped up in articles.  Find other articles to edit and your experience will be much more fulfilling.   Come to visit Mao often, and put it on your watchlist, but don't let it consume you or sour you on wikipedia.   I can guarantee you that 10 years from now, there will STILL be edit wars on the Mao page.  Working through the night to make a perfect article won't stop someone from getting up in the morning and ruining your delicate balancing act.  You probably have great insight into many things that are completely uncovered in Wiki  give those a try sometime.

Hope this helps,

 As for your substantive proposal, I agree that significant coverage in multiple sources is the GNG standard, but the sources don't have to be presented before an article can be created.  For example, I created 1892 Harvard Crimson football team knowing that significant coverage exists in multiple sources, but for starting purposes I considered it sufficient to have citations to reliable sources such as the Harvard site and CFDW.  Hopefully, another editor will pick up the baton and expand further, but I don't see how or why an article such as 1892 Harvard should be a candidate for deletion when a search of The New York Times archives of newspapers.com turns up a plethora of coverage for the topic. Stubs are not where we end up, but sometimes they serve a useful purpose in getting things started.

I believe that if there are serious questions regarding this matter, the better place for such discussion would probably be at the WP:RSN or WP:NPOVN, and also perhaps contact editors at WP:LAW or any editors with legal expertise to see if the possible flaw in the above logic is a real flaw.

You're right Milo.  A consensus of scientists in the scientific field of parapsychology.  Only that. Wikipedia follows the scientific consensus in the field. We don't ask psychologists what the conditions are inside a neutron star.  We really don't care what they have to say.  And of course, we would present the viewpoints of the critics of parapsychology, and more so than with other articles on science.  I have absolutely no desire not to accurately present what the critics have to say.

Even if I were pushing parapsychology, I still would not try to censor the critics, because that would only detract from my case- the reader would be able to tell it was a whitewash.

I wrote everything I wrote from the perspective I would think the article would eventually have anyway.  So you know exactly how I would think it should be presented.

i would suggest to remove the passage about the mode of action of deet.this is speculaton and not proven. based on the NOR guidelines i cant say its wrong, but my data suggest that it might be not correct (blood substitute with ATP as sole attractant is also 'protected' by DEET (while there is no lactic acid...).   

Removed the """"natural alternatives"""" or actually added a question mark. Added refs to show that these """"alternatives"""" do not work. Also removed various distinctions between """"natural"""" and """"synthetic"""". There is no difference between a molecule synthesised chemically and naturally. Last: DEET is a repellant, NOT an insecticide.  

Made new page on DEET, using material gleaned largely from the CDC and EPA pages, and a couple of studies on health effects and insect-repellant effectiveness (from Google).  Although a bunch of the pages say one should be careful only to wear DEET when necessary, not under clothing, etc., they don't spell out why they're concerned.  I'm guessing DEET is chemically nasty (is it an organo-phosphate?), and so may have carcinogenic or other unfortunate properties.  If someone knows (and ideally can show) what these suspected effects might be, I think a short (hopefully rational) addition to the DEET page is called for.   15:03, 20 Oct 2003 (UTC)

What was Charlie Coll's contribution? Some Canadians think he invented the stuff.  22:13, 18 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Is it a poison? If so, what is the LD_50? Is it liquid or a gas or solid (at room temp and standard conditions)? Thanks.  

As mentioned in the article, its effect on the human body is not yet fully understood; it's ?gay? (eh? - Ed) and not an organophosphate (as seen from the chemical formula image) but the effect seen with leeches provides a clue as to what might happen if enough of it entered the body. The effect on leeches is added from my own experience, using a concentrated DEET stick (like a deodorant applicator) and only needing to touch the leech for it to convulse off. It's a liquid at rtp, as far as I can tell.  10:10, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
Be careful adding from your own experience. That basically violates the Wikipedia:No original research policy. But that's simple to avoid, since if you've seen the effect, most likely someone else has. Wikipedia needs to be a secondary source, citing other published sources. So find a published source that finds the same thing, and the addition would be much better. Also it is liquid, as long as the repellant product bottles that say they are 100% deet really are. Also, just eyeballing from it's structure, liquid looks about right. I read a bunch of studies on DEET, and they all basically say it is safe as far as they can tell, but avoid overexposure as much as possible. A very small percentage of the time, some people (12 if I recall the study correctly, out of a large population) have a reaction to DEET. Basically the 60 years it has been used and the large amount of usage is strong evidence that at least the stuff is not really really nasty. So the article looks pretty accurate in that respect. -  Talk 12:00, Jun 13, 2005 (UTC)
Whoops, didn't know about that. Thanks. I'll leave it in for the moment and will try to remember to do backup research when I get home; if anyone believes that the information is unreliable enough please feel free to mark it out, and I'll just have to find a better source than word of mouth from my parents at the time ;)
Later: Researched. Found a fair bit of anecdotal evidence but not enough hard evidence to keep my previous addition in. Also a 1998 study shows DEET may actually accelerate absorption through the skin, so going to revert the edit. Putting in a link with lots of detail I found to make myself feel better ;)  16:38, 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)
No worries. Now you know and can make great contributions. There are plenty of things to help out with, so do some research and add what you can. If you don't feel like doing that, just fix formatting errors and help link all the related concepts, etc. -  Talk 17:37, Jun 13, 2005 (UTC)

I would change a couple of the wordings from """"pesticide"""" to """"repellent"""" or """"chemical"""" so it does not imply that DEET functions as a pesticide. There seems to be a lot of confusion about that on various sites so perhaps it would be",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Military history WikiProject Newsletter, Issue I 

 The Military history WikiProject Newsletter Issue I - March 2006  Project news
 An independent military history peer review has been created for the benefit of the project.  A number of articles have already been reviewed, receiving significantly more feedback within the project than they did on the generic peer review page.
 The project's Collaboration of the Fortnight got off to a great start with Ferdinand Foch and is now focusing on the military history of Spain.
 Two new task forces—dealing with warfare during classical antiquity and the Middle Ages—have been created.
 An effort to build a catalogue of high-quality maps for use in military history articles is now underway.
 The newly-formed translation department is looking for volunteers to help with translating featured articles from other-language Wikipedias. From the Coordinators
Welcome to the inaugural issue of the Military history WikiProject's newsletter!  We hope that this new format will help members—especially those who may be unable to keep up with some of the rapid developments that tend to occur—find new groups and programs within the project that they may wish to participate in.  

Please consider this inital issue to be a prototype; as always, any comments and suggestions are quite welcome, and will help us improve the newsletter in the coming months.

, Lead Coordinator Current proposals
 Proposed guidelines for categories of military people are currently being discussed.  A number of issues have already been resolved, but the proposed scheme is still in draft form and further input would be very welcome.

I understand what the confusion is about. But for clarity, let's clear this out: These are the contentious edits and their summaries:

 """"That feels like WP:WEASEL""""

 """"Inferred by TBA status""""

 """"To me, this says """"they're on the entry list, but we don't really believe it will happen""""

 """"Same as before""""

Crucially you only went to the talk page after making these edits. These edits were then followed 4 hours and 24 minutes later by three edits to correctly format the footnotes after you were again reverted by User:Twirlypen 2 hours 28 minutes later

 """"If this is going to be done, it should be done like this (need to make two more edits before changes are fully visible""""

Now I have two questions:

1) Can you understand why contributors could consider those first four edits as edit-warring, especially considering those summaries.

2) Why did you not indicate in your edit summary for the last two edits of that contentious set of four that you were reformatting them and thus making consistent with community opinion if that was your goal and why did you remove the content entirely in the first place if you only wanted to reformat?

I still don't think you actually broke WP:3RR because the policy clearly states a series of continuous, uninterrupted edits can be considered to be one revert. I can understand though that this is deemed to be a minor edit war.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Just as a point of clarification, I think we all have to keep in mind the difference between a reliable result and a valid claim.  I don't think it would be possible to claim that g is not a reliable result - as Bpesta said, it's been replicated far too many times to say it's just an artifact.  The debate is over what this reliable result means (e.g. which theoretical claim about the underlying cause of the effect is valid), and that is a complex, multi-sided, yet-to-be-resolved-if-ever question.  Frankly, I doubt science will have a decent answer to that question until it has a more analytic definition of what intelligence is (and being a bit of a developmentalist myself, I suspect that that definition will be much more subtle than can be captured by a simple measure like IQ), but as it stands, the best we are going to be able to do with this section is discuss g in its basics,and then lay out various interpretations with proper attributions, so that it doesn't look like the section is advocating any one amongst the several competing ideas.

They intervene in any Balkan history and politics related  article, pushing Greek POV, launch edit wars,  and repeated reverts of  vandalized by them versions, permanent deletions, block users, merges and redirects to deletetion of undesired new articles. Their main target is to distort all articles lelated to  ISLAM, TURKEY, REBUBLIC OF MACEDONIA, BULGARIA, ALBANIA (CHAMERIA), THEIR MINORITIES IN GREECE AND THEIR HISTORY. They attack  every article criticizing Greece transforming it  to Greekish propaganda POV. They became maniacs in optimizing dark side of Greek history.They communicate each other by secret e-mails avoiding messages through their talk pages to avoid publicity. This group acting in a systematic way to revert articles, when one of member makes the limit of 3 reverts, one another continues with 4th revert to avoid punishment for violating 3rv rule.

Today I find recipes and their variations by query - not by my query of the computer but by the computer's query of me.

What makes this possible is the computers ability to minimize the number of questions it must ask.

bebbab8cb1701ff8,"""To my memory the 'NO' refers to the negative as per linguistic negatives.  It doesnt mean the word """"No"""".  I dont do linguistics (the science of linguistics i.e. which is where that 'No' comes from)but know the wiradjui lannguage and culture pretty well.  A lot copy that 'Wiradjui = No' material not realisng it is not about word definition but linguistic structure.  I just do wiradjuri word definition tied to where the word refers to.  Linguistics/archaeology claims there is just one true 'word' a ssuch which is 'sign'.  There are multiple words if Australia's Indigneous language is considered.  because this language has been mostly separated from what it refers to (cultere) the archs/linguists then think they can take possession.  Its like the rock art battles where some archs claim they must be preserved because current day Indigneosu people are painting over them, (a cultural practice as part of ongoing culture).  So linguistics may tell us that wiradjuri = No.  It doesnt.  The word means what it does similar to 'sign's' referent = sign.

Do forgive me, I thought I had posted a response (!). Evidently not!... 

Fire is fought with (very well organised, well read and very polite) fire on Wikipedia I'm afraid; unless we challenge this, and outline why the use of English nationality over British nationality is just not encyclopedic, providing some authoritative citations and examples of other encyclopedias, then the mess we're in will remain.

I certainly have no intentions of """"Britishing"""" everything on Wikipedia - indeed I've voted for the descriptions of places in the UK to use the constituent country, and to use the constituent country flagicon when a settlement is twinned (as settlements can be twinned within the UK). However, there just is no such thing as a Welsh passport or Scottish nationality law - we should be using the UK as a frame of reference where it is wholly verifiable and applicable (London, England isn't hosting the Olympics, but London, United Kingdom - a balance of context is needed).

A compromise may well be all that is needed here - [[British nationality law|Northern Irish]] might be a thought, or some kind of duality of UK and C.C. - but I believe it should be codified and consistent throughout Wikipedia.

My suggestion that I thought I had posted, was that I think we should search for some contributors who share our concerns and understanding.

 Referencing 

Referencing on Wikipedia, thanks to its primitive interface, is a pain. There are a couple of ways to do it: one widely-used method is to simply copy and edit references from another article. The Meridian Hill Park article has a start on references: it's got a heading and a {{reflist}} template, so you're partways there already. There are some extant citations in the text, like{{citation |title=Roads to Diversity: Adams Morgan Heritage Trail |url=http://www.culturaltourismdc.org/sites/default/files/pdf/AMHT_English.pdf |author=Cultural Tourism DC |date=2005}} and {{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?node=cityguide/profile&id;=799601 |title=Meridian Hill Park: Sports and Recreation Locations in Washington, DC on washingtonpost.com's City Guide |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-16}}. You can see that the references are framed by  (or ) and  in HTML-like markup. You use named references if you are going to use a particular reference more than once. When embedded in the text they'll cause notes to appear in the References section at the bottom of the page.

In the top left of the edit window you should see a toolbar that has, at the left, a button that says """"Cite."""" Clicking it will show a drop-down menu of citation references for web, news, book and journal references, which then leads to a form that you can fill out (not all forms need to be used), and will insert a formatted reference wherever your cursor happens to be in the text. Often, for book references, you can dispense with extensive context after the first reference, and just say Smith, p. 15 and go on.

My main concern on the tone of the article is the use of intensifiers and adjectives in general, which is frowned upon in encyclopedic style. A certain dryness is called for, but there's an art to keeping just this side of plodding declarative prose. It's an interesting exercise. Perhaps not Joe Friday, more like Bill Gannon. 

Have a look at the citations policy for more: also verifiability and reliable sourcing are important. The policies on no original research is important, since Wikipedia is a tertiary source that relies on secondary published sources.

Reply Remove Incorrect Libelous Comment By Media Lawyer 

I have the information now to refute what has been commented by that commenter.

a)Incorrect. Richie Ramone did not say such he would sue them for 20 years. That did not happen Source please?

b)Incorrect. Richie Ramone did not say he would """"sue and reap millions"""" There are no interviews with Richie Ramone about his lawsuit. Only statements from his lawyers.Sources please?

c)Incorrect. Most do not say Richie Ramone sued because he was """"embittered"""" that he left. No one has alleged that. Tommy left, CJ left, Dee Dee left. End Of The Century actually advances the case that it was an impossible situation to be in the Ramones. That is public record. They were, in the main, miserable to be in the Ramones. Public record. So, Source please?

d) The band did not continue to be successful. Source please? The band was NEVER financially successful in Joey Ramone's lifetime, as far as album sales, and it got worse after Richie left. Richie Ramone left because he was tired of the grind, playing only the 4-4, their lack of mainstream success, and that was reported in Rolling Stone in August 2007. They were dropped by Sire Records that year. The band deteriorated, due to Dee Dee Ramone's quitting in 1989. Most sourced information is that they were on a downhill slide from then. According to USA today, they sold most of their albums after Joey's death in 2001. To date, Ramones CDs with Somebody Put Something In My Drink have sold more than 1.3 million copies. Smash You was released as the title track to Loud Fast Ramones. It was called """"Loud Fast Ramones Smash You"""" and has sold more than 350,000 units, according to Soundscan. 

e)Richie Ramone did not sue his """"dead band mates"""". He sued the Estate of Johnny Ramone as well as Ramones Productions. He did not sue the Estate of Joey Ramone, nor the Estate of Dee Dee Ramone, nor has he sued the wives and relatives of Joey Ramone and Dee Dee Ramone. Source is the lawsuit. He did not sue Joey's brother Mickey Leigh, Dee Dee's wife Barbara, nor Joey's truly exceptional and lovely mother Charlotte Lesher, who passed away a year ago. 

First Media Lawyer says the band continued to be successful, and then it's that they have no money. Fact is, Ramones productions is a very lucrative business. Again, USA Today reported in 2002 that the band sold millions of units since Joey Ramone's death. That is according to Soundscan. Paper Magazine and others have reported on the big business of marketing Ramones since the sad passing of Joey Ramone. Media Lawyer's statement that the Ramones are in """"hardship"""" is not sourced. 

Request: Please remove what we believe is libelous incorrect TALK comment by Media Lawyer, unless Media Lawyer can produce reliable sources. At the very least, none of it is sourced.

 Favor. I believe the section is neutral enough to remove the neutral dispute tag. In order of Jefferson to get to GA status the article needs to not have any neutrality disputes. There is criticism of Jefferson for not speaking out on emanicipation during his Presidency, his reluctance to free his slaves, his reliance on slavery to support his aristocratice lifestyle, his rhetoric contradicting his slave ownership, and the Louisiana Purchase treaty increased slavery in the West. Positive statements on Jefferson was that he was a humane slaveowner, mentioning his proposal to stop slavery in the West after 1800, and he banned the United States slave trade. Editors can address any other issues without the neutrality dispute tag. The article does state he manummitted only a few slaves. As far as """"humane"""" that is a matter of subjection. A reference that did state """"humane"""" would be helpful for the section.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

1914ed0ac191da51,"REPLY: Many distributors say not to use chlorine bleach nor cationic sufactants (fabric relaxers, fabric conditioners).  

AIUI too high a concentration of bleach may distort the fibers [please confirm].  The cationic surfactant will fill the holes in the microfiber and reduce its efficiency.

Similarly microfiber should not be washed at too high temperatures (eg 80 celsius).  However it is hard to get microfiber to release the dirt it holds and so the method of washing needs to be a bit of a compromise.

Do not wash with other garments especially those which shed small particles of fiber as these will be taken in and held by the microfiber cloth.

There does not seem to be a case for using special detergents.

Again, some will advocate using a drier but the temperature must not be so high as to distort the micro fibers.  I would not want to iron or press washed microfiber because of the possible loss of the dirt traps.

Some distributors will suggest the use of bleach (eg 3M and its Scotch-Brite microfiber kitchen cloths) and others will specify rather high temperatures.  Perhaps their microfibers have been treated or manufactured to withstand such washing but I am not sure how it could have been achieved.

 Don - This is classic - You wrote 10 pounds of stuff, took off in a tangent, and didn't even answer my question under discussion requiring no more than a simple yes/no objective response. Then you went ahead and reversed my deletion in the article without discussing it here. Please get consensus before making any article changes.
 I took a closer look at your source for the """"under 18"""" thing and found a few issues:
 1. It is a paid report costing $30 to access. How can any editor verify that you aren't making bogus claims? 
 2. This article seems to be referring to meditation in general and not Sahaj Marg, so it's not relevant to this discussion - You may want to place it in the meditation article.
 3. It is speaking of the inappropriateness of meditation from a pediatric standpoint (supposedly - I haven't read it). The wiki article on pediatrics says that this science is relevant to children up to 14 to 21 of age. So how is this specifically relevant to the """"18 years of age"""" point under discussion here? If you want to put in a criticism of Sahaj Marg making younger children meditate, don't hide it in an irrelevant footnote. 
 4. Finally, the sentence """"Sahaj Marg guru recommends a minimum age of 18 before beginning the practice of meditation, implying this technique is not suitable for younger people."""" is your extrapolation of the motivations for the SRCM rules, i.e. original research.

The unverifiable claims were the ones that I set out to remove from Wikipedia - the claims that a heretofore unheard-of Sonja de Lennart, who was completely unknown on Google until December 2007, created Capri pants.

Originally there was one site given as a source for the Sonja de Lennart claims - www.sonjadelennart.com, a site owned by Eleonora de Lennart and created in February 2008.  A simple glance at this website will show that it is not a reputable source.  Instead, it was fabricated for the sole purpose of fooling Wikipedia.
Unfortunately, the Wikipedia hoax was not detected before answers.com and other websites picked up the false claim of authorship and it was included in an Associated Press article that was widely syndicated.  The success of the hoax in tricking a reporter is now being used to give the hoax legitimacy.

Users Pchip and Delennart have had no other purpose on Wikipedia than to spread the false stories about Capri pants.  Your actions in supporting their claims and in blocking the attempt to undo their persistent vandalism are damaging Wikipedia.",0,0,0,0,0,0

If I really had my way, I would reorganize this page (and every other Survivor page) to be more like other reality TV series in that you have your summary tables, and then a block with each episode detail: in the case of Survivor, you'd have your episode summary, exile reasoning, and voted out reasoning all in the same block.  The title quote would lead up that block.  Now, to do that with the existing S pages would take a loooot of work, so the easy way is to either do trivia (adding length to page), add to the episode summary (eg 'Episode 1 """"Wow, this is Survivor"""" (John)"""": blah blah blah'), or add to where they already are (in the episode summary table).

Whilst the article does mention these things in one form or another, it really does need to be succinctly in this location as well. Many readers will come to this page, read the headings and skip straight to the contraversy section. Without differentiating in a small way my two points, we risk the reader coming away with a very biased view of stem cell research as a whole.  
It is a defect of this article that it talks too much about “cures” which indeed gives a biased view. The controversy section is best kept short, as there is a main article. 
I agree, the Controversy section is best kept short, not incorrectly biased and lacking information, as it currently stands.  
The controversy is that some people think that it is immoral to use cells from embryos that will be put in the trashcan otherwise. That is all there is to it. 
Your anaolgy is about as crass as saying """"oh look, theres a dead body there, lets use it for fertilizer, after all, its dead"""". Whilst you might not agree with that analogy, it is roughly how many people would view your point. Your opinion whilst well informed isn't any more right then someone else who adheres to a different belief system. And thank you for clarrifying that it is indeed a contraversial issue. As a side note """"some people"""" covers a large portion of the people on this planet.  
No, because those embryos really do end in trash cans, whatever the whish of the family be. This is the general rule, whereas found bodies end up in the morgue, then are incinerated if not claimed. And the ashes are indeed used as fertiliser in this case. It might seem crass to say so, but it is still the truth. 

Stem cell research should be legalized everywhere. What would happen to people if they had any of their body part burned or worse? Stem cell research could help grow a new one based on the persons DNA et all and reattach back to the body. The wouldn’t reject it because it wont be foreign to it  

 Replace the whole page.

 Key stem cell research events

January 2008 - Publication of the Neural Colony-Forming Cell (NCFC) Assay as a simple assay to enumerate neural stem cells. Importantly, the assay allows discrimination between neural stem cells and neural progenitor cells.

I dont consider the March 2008 key event to be so notable given that it was only shown in one individual and has not been replicated since.

Page Rebuild

For quite some time, the Alcoholism entry has provided out of date or incorrect information. I'm in the process of rewriting it to meet contemporary scientific standards for the disease. I welcome external review and discussion. 
 Stuart Gitlow MD (Chief, Annenberg Physician Training Program in Addictive Disease, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NYC)

Thanks for your contributions so far.  You may be interested in creating a user account.  Some of the benefits are discussed at this page: Wikipedia:Why_create_an_account%3F  

It greatly reduces the chances people will revert your changes, for one thing. -)  

Good points, and I've created an account as you suggest. See my notes below as well. sg

In response to the commentary at the very, very bottom of this page (dupe social impacts), I've rearranged the content of the page a bit.  I believe that it now better reflects the chronology of how people are impacted by alcoholism, and therefore reflects the order in which this information becomes important to people: definition, effects, diagnoses, treatment, broader issues.

FYI, I renamed the first instance of Social Issues to read """"Societal Issues"""" and moved it into the broader issues area.  I moved the latter one up to become a subheading of the """"Effects"""" category.  After this edit I'm going to go remove the original note of this (because it's no longer germain), so you'll have to look at the next edit in order to read it.  

In looking over the article and the discussion of Stanton Peele's perspective et al, I'm wondering whether some of the ongoing discussion held on this page is about a misconception that alcoholism is equal to """"excessive drinking,"""" whatever that is. Alcoholism doesn't refer to someone who drinks a lot. Many people drink a great deal but aren't alcoholic. Conversely, many alcoholics don't drink very much at all compared against the general population's intake.  

The section on """"terminology"""" that you removed was intended to address exactly this misunderstanding.  Since you seem to think it's important, I'm putting it back in.  

righto 

Despite the difficulties that we've had of late, the entry is coming together nicely. I'm looking over the EFFECTS section, which has a good deal of information on alcohol itself, and the impact of alcohol USE. It is difficult to tease out the effects of alcoholism versus the effects of alcohol. The effects of alcoholism when an alcoholic is in recovery, for example, would be different from the effects of alcoholism while an individual is drinking on a daily basis. (This is similar, of course, to the situation with other diseases - the effects of diabetes when an individual has well-controlled blood glucoses are different from the effects of untreated diabetes). Nevertheless, I wonder whether the entire section would be more appropriately found in the alcohol article rather than here in the alcoholism article. Can we build a consensus regarding this area?  

 Alcoholism vs. Alcohol abuse 

The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism make a difference between one and the other. What I found more confusing is that from """"alcohol abuse"""" you're redirected to """"alcoholism"""".

""""Alcoholism, also known as 'alcohol dependence,' is a disease that includes four symptoms: craving, loss of control, physical dependence, and tolerance"""". 

Moreover, """"Alcohol abuse differs from alcoholism in that it does not include an extremely strong craving for alcohol, loss of control over drinking, or physical dependence"""", etc etc.

>> Getting the facts @ NIAAA

 

Response:  Good point.  From one interested perspective, AA literature itself discusses this issue and draws a clear distinction between alcohol abuse and alcoholism. 

I can't make the correction. I'm not that good informed and my english is quite lousy. Could you..?  

How about mentioning something about alcoholism as a form of drug addiction? Correct me if I'm wrong, but alcohol is certainly a hard drug, characterized by intense (and possibly fatal) withdrawals... isn't that addiction?

f2d71c0f82efe479,"""Hip-Hop Is NOT Dead But Ready To """"Get It""""!!! (Calif) Hip-hop producer and west coast native E. Re-ill debuts his album “Get It”. “Get It” is the representation of E. Re-ill's mindset, """"I'm in a place in my life where I need to become who I am... I got to “Get It”!!! says E. Re-ill. “Get It” is an album that when focused on can bring out the drive in you to make your dreams real. Why you may ask? You need three things to achieve your goals Hope (expectations), Hustle (drive) and Hunger (appetite for success). These three mindsets are displayed in this album which accompanied by your dreams this will enable your inner being to ““Get It”!” E. Re-ill has been producing beats since the late 80's, influenced by Dr. Dre (and who isn't), Rick Rubin, performed with many stars, and has participated in great projects. A prior and classic venture was with the street-ball company Y.P.A. and the DVD titled """"The War"""". E. Re-ills’ most rememberable time in making music is when N.W.A. was filming the classic controversial video """"Straight Outta Compton"""" E. Re-ill's older brother caught the attention of Ice Cube and filmed Ice Cube telling E. Re-ill to keep up and he'll see him on top!!! That statement would drive E.Re-ill for many years. Hip-Hop has always been the “in touch with your inner voice” music and then we have always informed our community of how we see the actions displayed in front of us. Hip-Hop can be fun, dark, and everything in between. However, usually no matter the topic a hip-hop song it should captivate you!!! “Get It” is no exception to this, “Get It” displays emotional drive, creative sound packages, consistent vibe and sounds, and arguably some of the best lyrics delivered on hip-hop tracks in a long while. Songs like """"Dark People"""" a description of pushing your self to great heights even when life shorts you of opportunities. """"I'm So Gangsta"""" is a nice surprise!!! It is Fresh Caesar's look at the world biggest gangsta George Bush, and his fumbles with war and Katrina!!! Don't cheat yourself I'm so Gangsta is a necessary download!!! Oakland native and a brilliant lyricist Fresh Caesar (a.k.a. Omega) is currently working on his own album titled """"Jack London’s Square"""". Fresh Caesar displays lyrical strengths of Nas and Jay-Z with a west coast flavor delivery. Fresh Caesar displays great lyrical ability and is definitely not your average rapper on the mic. Down South/Oakland rapper, Tom-E-Gunn has the sounds of Snoop Dogg's early gangsta swag with grit of the south. These songs are actually lost demos recently found. E. Re-ill felt compelled to use the demos for the world to hear due to their strong delivery of life experiences. E. Re-ill's “Get It” album is about all the aspirations that we desire in life money, success, respect, reflections of life, and excess of women and parties.

Let's put it this way Flo, everyone has talked past me here for months. It is absolutely frustrating to have everything I contribute get labeled as """"disruptive."""" Disruptive, how? Tedentious, how? I sure as heck don't feel that I have done so because as far as I'm concerned I've acted in good faith trying to make Wikipedia the best it can be.

If you want to explain the rules to me and how I can be who I am on Wikipedia and stay within the rules, I'm all ears. I just want FM to leave me alone. How would you feel if you were new on a site and everything you did was declared illegal by people who disagree with you when there is a pretence to neutrality without any explanation?

If you have done such a good job explaining everything to me, then why do I feel that I've been ganged up on without just cause? I know a lot of people who feel that Wikipedia has a definite bias when it comes to politics and religion that's not very positive.

Why not listen to me? What do you all have to lose? My faith is the core of my being, and it's who I am. Do you expect me to junk my worldview to contribute to Wikipedia? Have any of you stopped to consider how your own worldviews contributes to how you interpret the rules?

Do you care how ordinary readers view Wikipedia? You probably do, or else you wouldn't be here. The fact is traditionally minded Christians number over 1 billion people on this planet, and close to 100 million in the United States alone. That's not some tiny crackpot minority out there. If I feel attacked by Wikipedia, or feel that my POV is misrepresented, how do you think they feel reading Wikipedia?

Let's face it here, factually, the perspective represented in the articles in the Dominionism series, from my perspective, seem to overemphasize the views of a small minority in the United States regarding the Christian Right. 

Why should my work be reversed when I elaborate on the Dominionist's POV, which BTW, I don't agree with, for the sake of ensuring fairness. Or when FM, removes something I wrote from a reputable Evangelical ministry critical of Christian Reconstructionist theology? He tells me it's false or that I'm POV pushing. HOW? I cited the sources, which are widely respected in Evangelical circles.

What am I supposed to think when 2/3s of the article is devoted to the opponents of the Christian Right, who by the way are a minority of the total American population. Bush won twice because of their support and elected the GOP to Congress and a majority of the statehouses. 

Katherine Yurica's and TheocracyWatch's POV represents a MINORITY of the population. I have no idea where you live. Perhaps their perspectives are popular among your friends, but they don't represent the larger picture. How is writing from the majority perspective POV pushing or giving undue weight to my perspective, considering it's the perspective of just a little over 50 percent of the American population.

I suggested banning partisanship as part of the NPOV rule and Consensus rule, but FeloniousMonk reverted my changes that had been made by a previous editor. When he does that, what am I supposed to think about his motives? I don't know him, and he hasn't exactly been the most friendly person to me since day one. 

Have you ever stopped to think, it's not what you say, but how you say it? The tone from yourself and the other admins has kept me on the defensive, and what am I supposed to think, other than what I've said ad nauseam? I feel attacked, not consulted with.

So far, I feel that no one has explained anything about their perspectives to me except for what comes across on my screen in my mind as person attack. Things like WP:POV, WP:POINT etc., that get put up when I feel that I have done nothing wrong comes across as a personal attack instead of.

Could you consider rephrasing it this way, or this is how you should be doing this. That's constructive in my view. 

Instead of hurling rules at me, the interpretations of which I disagree with, tell me why you think I stepped over the line and your rationale. I react positively to reasoned explanations, not summary reversals of my work, accusations of POV pushing, etc., without explanation.

Maybe you've been at this for awhile, so you take things for granted. I simply go to the rulebook and fail to see where all of you are getting your opinions from. Interpretation my friend. I want to understand your interpretation, and why you interpret the rules the way you do.

 David Archuleta won 

In the recently concluded Myx Music Awards 2009 in the Philippines, David Archuleta's song, Crush, won as the Favorite International Music video beating Britney Spears' Womanizer, Jonas Brothers' When You Look Me in the Eyes, Paramore's Decode and Miley Cyrus' 7 Things.

The person on the page you are citing is giving a fictional review of an album.  Jeff is still David's manager.

 revision to chart 

I know it can be written that he was safe every week but go around to all the AI contenstant charts and you see the result of every week in the chart.   
Yea and they all should be changed. Just as we don't beat the obvious into people we don't need to state ___ has again gone another week. The info of what order they sang is also unhelpful. The lede clearly states he finished as the runner-up and we can give credit to our readers that they will realize that he didn't just sing those songs as a special guest. I'm not going to delete on all those other AI articles but I believe that should happen.   Banjeboi 
 So you think if someone wants to know if a contestant was safe they can go the American Idol season page?   
The chart is a supplement to the text which should be clear. The lede should state as of April 2009 ____ is a contestant. And when eliminated it states that info. Likewise with bottom three info, if it's relevant it will be in a reliable source - and OMG every bit of this stuff is covered - so we then cover it. _____ has never been in the bottom three or ____ has been in the bootom three twice before elimiation, etc. The order they sang? That seems likes it's original research or, sorry to say, fancruft, but not helpful on the biography articles. We have no reliable sourcing that the order impacts anything although it might. It ends up being as trivial as what they wore, their hair, who the friends were in the audience etc. If any of it is covered in reliable sources then maybe. Meanwhile the season article does a fairly good job of organizing the rest. Last year i took this article on and I guarantee it's been a non-stop effort to keep it cleaned up. Most people do have good intentions but there are a lot of fans who insert unhelpful bits. Sorry for not responding sooner but I do watch this",0,0,0,0,0,0

Or does he have a problem with allowing newcomers to work on wikipedia as well and merely try to land them in trouble instead? I am not really sure why he is determined to complain about me no matter what edit I make, but his aggressive stance is clear, and if everyone were to behave this way towards newbies, I am sure wikipedia would become a very isolated place, which it is indeed not.

 Reason? 

Was there any reason that you removed several links to album reviews?

I thoroughly read your """"ON EXTERNAL LINK REMOVAL"""" and what I don't get is why then have you not removed every link to every review on all of Wikipedia? They are all external links. They all """"tunnel people away from the wikipedia."""" So why then are you singling out a single website and removing all of the links to their reviews?  If you would have actually bothered to visit all the links (which I somehow doubt, as all your reverts were popups-assisted.. whatever that means) you would find actual album reviews that IMO are much better than some of the crap that Pitchfork spits out. 

I'd also like to add that it is people like you who make me not want to contribute to Wikipedia, and the reason I've never joined. Instead of editing pages for the sake of contributing, you've designated yourself as the be-all end-all """"link remover""""  where """"link remover"""" means """"person who removes others' valid contributions to bolster his own self-importance.""""

And if you even bother using """"promotion"""" as a reason that VacantLips' contributions to the reviews lists were """"spam,"""" then I'll have to ask you to remove all of the external links from the """"Reviews"""" sections on all album pages...

 Idea for Talmud articles 

Hi Eliyak: I am reposting the following request from User  on my user talk page for wider notification:

I was thinking of trying to stimulate development of a series of articles on Gemara concepts and doctrines, maybe to help children or newcomers to Gemara with explanations of some fundamental concepts that recur throughout the Gemara. Some examples might be articles on Yiush, Chazakah, Ta'aninun (as in """"Ta'aninun L'Yoresh""""), Eidim Zomemin (forgive my awful transliterations), Migu, etc., etc. Maybe we could even create a category or subcategory for it. I created Breira in this vein. As I don't have the experience or expertise in Wikipedia to know what to do to best develop this idea, I figured I'd come to you for your opinions on: (1) whether it's a good idea; and (2) How to best go about implementing it.

 Just a cc regarding the Blagojevich ITN 

Copied from my talk page, no response required

Hey folks, since there's two users in this talk I'll just thread this here.  I promoted it to ITN on the reasoning that the removal of a state executive is, IMO, notable whether the subject himself is or not (though I'd figure it is inherent).  Seemed obvious to me that this was more than Wikinews, which is why I skipped the discussion phase.

As to the portal, thanks for letting me know, I was not aware of the duplication being needed in the editing, I thought it was transcluded.  Learn something new every day ;)

And lastly, I still think that it should be on the main page.  While I can understand Spencer's logic in that it needs more information to make it encyclopedic and not just news, I personally don't think that anymore should or could be added to the article on the Blagojevich scandal at the time and it is a pretty descriptive article.

 Tags 

Back on February 23, you made some hefty edits to the Santa Claus in Northern American culture article.  In captioning some images, you used a few pairs of  tags (which in itself didn't affect the size of the text within the captions), but you didn't properly close the tags, so all the text afterwards was made to be really tiny.  When you use a tag, you have to close it by typing a slash into the tag, like this:   I don't know why nobody noticed that the article was messed up until at least three months later, but I've taken care of it.

Also, while I'm at it, when I saw who had made the edit, I was slightly concerned to see the """"bot"""" part of your username—it made me worry that someone had programmed a bot to make edits, but that the person hadn't programmed the bot to correctly close tags.  I see now that this isn't the case, but have you considered getting your username changed so that you don't cause people to think you're a bot?   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

User:Lord Loxley's reply, with my own comments 

""""The recidivism rate of TharkunColl is sad, for he has vowed to disrupt the Wikipedia to make a point. Here he attempts yet again, to blow smoke all our arses.""""

You are the one who is disrupting Wikipedia. I am upholding the consensus.

""""TharkunColl believes that the English and Welsh are not ethnic twins of Southern Britain (in the present day and age), perhaps unaware that they are indistinguishable to the world at large. The Principality of Wales has not been its own country since before Edward I of England, while the Principality of Liechtenstein is an independent country that has no real ethnic status different from its neighbours. His argument is to play up national-separatist sentiments that serve nobody in the present day, about a Principality vis a vis Kingdomwhich form bestows actual ethnic statuses to peoples. Wales has never been featured on the arms of state and seals of office that denote independence, the chief marker of separate identity among the nations in Europe. That the Welsh people page exists, doesn't qualify its existence. This guy believes that there is a sort of """"Anglo-Celtic subrace"""" of Europeans, that is defined only by the British Isles (an idea only popular among xenophobic yobbos proud of the British Empire's world domination, in an era circa the Great War). He believes that Brittany is part of the British Isles, rather than a former duchy in the Kingdom of Franceby choice over allegiance to England in the Breton War of Succession. He believes that mass settlement, colonisation and the transcendence of national cultures is arguable in favour of the people under Canute the Great's dominion as governed by Winchester, but denies any significance in relations from 1066 (until the present) as determined by London and what the Normans did which transformed the populace in all waysespecially ancestry and tongue, to form actual and extant connections with the French, Scots and Irishthe countries England has dealt with for the past millenium. He uses racial definitions in respect to the """"Celtic fringe"""" and their English relationship, for we all know how the English never held special favour to them until the Hanoverians changed the political climate and drew sympathy from the English for the harsh oppressions of that regime which never bred into the population of the British Isles and was """"naturally nativised"""". The user believes the Norman Conquest was as removed from the people as the Constitutional Hanoverian rule, but more bloody and causing a Marxist class struggle between monarch and subject for centuries as opposed to a few decades in which it was possible to secure their integration as part of the English people themselves. My other opponent User:Enzedbrit believes that the Norman Channel Islanders are no different from the English, but TharkunColl thinks they are foreigners (since 1066) compared to the Celtic fringe (whom only assimilated to the English way of life because of aftereffects created by the Norman Conquest of England). This person has attacked my nationality as Canadian and put my knowledge into question, simply because I'm not jingoistic to punish the French in any and every discussion of themwe in Canada have learnt to get along, because English and French are more alike than differentdespite intense rivalry. He tries to speak with authority and down to me, while it is obvious that he is a crank out of the mainstream of academic institutions but well within the realm of football hooliganism.""""

Read what I wrote. I believe that the Welsh and English are indeed very close, but quite obviously still retain separate ethnic identities. You are trying to say that they are English. For your own sake, please don't say that if you ever go to Wales. I have never made any claims about an """"Anglo-Celtic subrace"""" and nor do I believe Britanny is part of the British Isles. Why do you ascribe false beliefs to me? As for you being a Canadian, all it means is that you may have a completely false view of what the English are like, based on your misperception of history. As I said, just because Canada is an Anglo-French society, it doesn't mean that England is. And the only crank here is you I'm afraid.

""""I made a reference to the Tudors being England's chief representative of the Romano-British in England's culture and identity, which you think is ludicrous or have problems interpreting what was written. It was the Tudors who brought a revival of King Arthur, which made it an official mythology of England.""""

The Tudors lived about a thousand years after the Romano-British period, so to call them a representation of it sounds a tad unreasonable. And their revival of the Arthurian myths was purely political.

The states where fighting more each other than the foreign states, and so every invasion made by foreign nations was made with the help of some German states against some others.

 Content Dispute 

I'm going to try and mediate the Iranian peoples dispute here could you please post your arguments there and we'll try and come to an reasonable comprimise   

1)Hi, History section needs clarification, while linguistically all of those people are related but it does not mean that ethnically they are all related to eachother, I am pointing to the last paragraph of the history section. It should be clarified. Thanks. Talk + 
 Modern Persians themselves are a diverse group of peoples descended from various Iranian and indigenous peoples of the Iranian plateau including the Elamites. Although all Persians are linguistically connected to each other ethnic backgrounds are diverse with many different cultural traits. 
Would something like that be preferable to you  

Yes, but the word Iranians instead of Persians. Persians are by themselves a member of that linguistic group. Talk + 
 Ok, I stand corrected (I'm not familiar with the topic matter at hand here, I'm googling trying to find information) - if nobody objects I propse changing the paragraph to the above, it seems clearer to me   

No sorry this paragraph: Thus, not unlike the previous example of Germanic peoples involving the English, who are of mixed Germanic and Celtic origin, Iranian is an ethno-linguistic group and the Iranian peoples display varying degrees of common ancestry and/or cultural traits that denote their respective identities.  Talk + 

Here I meant Iranian peoples linguistically are related but it does not mean that ethnically they are all related to eachother. so the claim refering to common ethnicity in the articler is not correct.
 Talk + 
 Ok, is Germanic peoples involving the English, who are of mixed Germanic and Celtic origin also an ethno-linguistic group? If so, should we add """"only"""" to Iranian is an ethno-linguistic group and the Iranian peoples display varying degrees of common ancestry and/or cultural traits that denote their respective identities
  

The Iranian people Unlike gernmanic people are from quite different etnicities like Turkic, Persian and others uncertain. The whole sentence is wrong and POV. we should drop the word common ethnicity and clarify that it is only a linguistic term'''. Talk + 

2)The info box does not belong here. Iranian peoples are not an ethnic group. They are several different ethnicities speaking different languages. It should be removed as in any other linguistic group. Talk + 
 I think you have a valid point there, I would like to see the argument to the contrary before making a recomendation though.

Let me refresh your memory.

pjacobi: Delete - one person's theory, not in any way in contact with academic reserach. Pjacobi  

My response: Who cares how many people wrote it, or whether it is """"in contact with academic reserach""""? If you want to read about things that are """"in contact with academic reserach"""", you should subscribe to academic journals. Wikipedia is not an appendage of academia, and the CTMU nowhere relies on """"contact with academic reserach"""" to make its points. Please, let's keep our eyes on the ball here. Asmodeus  

Now please read carefully.

1. Most theories are written by one person; others are free to utilize them (or not) in their own work later on down the line, as they choose. That others have not yet chosen to do so need not reflect on the theory or its applicability to important issues, particularly given the polarization associated with the central focus of the scholastic journal in which the CTMU was published. This is not necessarily a reflection on the theory; it is more likely pertinent to the philosophical assumptions under which others are working, which - inasmuch as we are, after all, talking about philosophy - may ultimately lead nowhere. Indeed, it may merely mean that other scholars are unfamiliar with the theory because they only pay attention to a narrow or professionally closed set of sources. You have improperly recommended this article for deletion on those grounds, and that was wrong of you as a Wikipedia editor.

This leads us to

2. It makes no difference whether a theory is """"notable to academic researchers"""" (whether or not this is the case). It has been patiently explained to you that academics are not the ones who make this particular theory notable; it is notable because it was covered by highly reputable sources in the popular media, and because it has a remarkable structure that no other theory possesses. Again, citing the superficially apparent inattention of academia as grounds for deletion was irresponsible of you as a Wikipedia editor.

You have voted to delete an informative, well-verified article about a notable topic on irrelevant or nebulous grounds for which you have no verification.

 This needs fixing and I mean NOW 

This article is very poorly done for one reason: there is no such thing as the Seven Laws of Noah. If anyone would care to read any version of the Book of Genesis (Bereishit), starting at chapter 9, the laws which Noah was given and the laws he already lived are clearly indicated. They are not seven mitzvot- I counted nine myself, and only one matches the alleged Seven Laws (not to eat bloody flesh or vivsect an animal).

For example, the first I counted was """"...be fruitful and multiply..."""". Does anyone see that as a Sheva Motzvot? I don't! Now, I can see this entry wishes to concentrate on Noahides and Noahidism; it's very fair and noble. But PLEASE consult the rabbis who clearly state as does the Bible that no such laws exist! No such laws are expounded upon, or even mentioned, in Genesis.

It is most especially important that this article try to move away with impartiality from the Jewish viewpoint. Gentiles do not have to obey rabbis or follow Jewish beliefs or extrapolations of Jewish halachah. Since the Laws of Noah were concocted, claiming Biblical authority by the Hasidim, this is a violation on their part. According to Jewish teaching, a Jew must not and cannot force a Gentile to do or accept anything!

Please clean this thing up- I'll help here and there, but I'm not going against these rabid Wikipedia Editor Chiefs or the Golden Calf Administrators!""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I urge you to read the long history records on the Ronald Ryan article and discussion pages. There have been defamatory and false edits against Ryan and his living family menbers. We know meatpuppets are using various fake IPs to add false material and to removal of factual material. In one of many recent disgusting edits by meatpuppet/s, Ryan was accused of having sexual relations with his own daughter. In another disgusting edit Ryan was accused of being born a homosexual. Ryan is dead but his family members are alive to take legal action against these meatpuppets. 

Ryan’s surviving members of his family will continue to correct the distorted, manipulated opinions and views of one book author Mike Richards, whilst all other referenced material is ignored, vandalized and removed. The scapegoat/excuse being used by these meatpuppets is wrong as it is outrageous. Members of the Ryan family are alive and well. 

Supporters of Ronald Ryan will forever unite on the facts of his case and execution. We will continue to contribute the facts, based on the hundreds of references that diagree with Richards personal views. Facts like: There is no scientific evidence whatsoever to prove Ryan fired a shot. 

To put it bluntly, the meatpuppets refuse to allow any contributions on the facts of the Ryan case. Their hatred for Ryan is rather sick and disturbing to say the least.

Having already read through all those reliable sources and many many many more...here's my take.  This paper...The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure...by Paul Samuelson has been cited over 5,000 times.  It provides the definitive theoretical justification for our tax system.  Samuelson's argument was that the benefit principle had a very limited scope because of the preference revelation problem...a problem which tax choice effectively solves.

I know Derex very well. He has been stalking me ever since I wrote the campaign finance article 6 months ago. I tell him if he finds anything incorrect in what I write to help himself and fix it, but he then ignores me and I find comments of his later on talk pages with vailed insults about spamming pages and calling me a zealot. He is clearly a stealth idealogue who has no intention of making constructive edits. His only goal appears to be stalking other constructive editors.

As for your statement that I am placing a """"relatively long 1996 fundraising scandal section"""" into this article: Hogwash. A short two sentence paragraph with a link to the main article is not a long section. Wikipedia rules clearly state we are to link relevant articles to eachother. As the DNC was fined for illegal fundraising and many of its fundraiser were convicted of crimes, this page is the most relevant page to link my article to. An article, by the way, that has FEATURED STATUS and has been showcased on Wikipedia's main page. I am putting the info back into the article where it belongs.

I have listed this article at WP:DRV for possible undeletion based on information I have received regarding a book that has been written by Trehin about his fictional city, Urville.  Interested parties should contribute to the discussion.  

Is this still deserving of featured article status?

I'm beginning to think that this article should be removed from the list of featured articles.  It seems to me that political ideas and attempts to be politically correct have compromised the factual veracity of this article.  This should be a pretty straightforward article about a neurological disorder like epilepsy or aphasia.  Instead, it reads as if Asperger syndrome is either some kind of blessing or lifestyle choice and that there are negligible drawbacks to having it.  The very fact that many of the participants on the talk page take issue or offense at even calling AS a disorder or disease when it is viewed as such by the medical community is rather telling.  I really think the mainstream medical and scientific view should be emphasized, as medicine and science strive to have the neutral point of view that this article lacks.  I'm not looking for an argument.  I'm simply warning those interested that if this article stays as it is I will probably lobby to have it removed as a featured article.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 You should wait for others to write an article about subjects in which you are personally involved. This applies to articles about you, your achievements, your business, your publications, your website, your relatives, and any other possible conflict of interest. 

Creating an article about yourself is strongly discouraged. If you create such an article, it might be listed on articles for deletion. Deletion is not certain, but many feel strongly that you should not start articles about yourself. This is because independent creation encourages independent validation of both significance and verifiability. All edits to articles must conform to Wikipedia:No original research, Wikipedia:Neutral point of view, and Wikipedia:Verifiability. 

If you are not """"notable"""" under Wikipedia guidelines, creating an article about yourself may violate the policy that Wikipedia is not a personal webspace provider and would thus qualify for speedy deletion.  If your achievements, etc., are verifiable and genuinely notable, and thus suitable for inclusion in Wikipedia, someone else will probably create an article about you sooner or later.

In light of your failure to think about the issue in advance, your actions were shameful.

 Justanother 
Hey! I'm glad you wrote me. This guy is exactly the kind of person I do not like. I don't know where to begin describing everything that is wrong with him. I can see it in the replies to you as well. L.Ron's military career, if it is fabricated, is obviously worth discussing. I don't know why it would be fabricated, it wouldn't change my opinion of him or anythiing, so many times things aren't what they seem, but it's still worth looking into. It isn't 'he said, she said', it can be figured out what the truth is. And he says anything else is PR. This is what bugs me about justanother, he says things like they are fact. NO, it isn't just PR. It could be that he lied, it could be that there was a mistake, etc. That isn't PR.

Ok, now I'm reading the posts on yourpage. This is so hard to understand. You're not supposed to talk about Scientology with him, he says? """"Is that clear""""? See,he speaks to people with an air of superiority, like he is the voice of reason, of authority.""""And I have no doubt that you consider yourself the soul of equanimity and justice."""" COMPLETE PROJECTION. 

Whoa, I'm on the Barbara Schwarz page, he did this with me to. I don't understand those people who feel the need to inform you of obvious thigns you would never do like you need them to inform you otherwise you would do it. He did that to me at first when we were friendly regarding editing Scientology pages (telling me not to do this or that, which I would never have done). 

I think the good thing is that this is just the internet. If it were real life, we would be able to tell in a second what was up with this guy and we wouldn't apply him the same weight that we apply other people. I sometimes forget that when I use the net because you're not getting the feel of the person saying the weird thing. It used to bug me some of the things that critics of Scientology used to say, and then I saw photos and video of them, and it made sense. You could tell they weren't really there, so I wasn't upset anymore. I'd love to see what this guy looks like. I'd probably end up feeling sorry for him and have compassion and overlook all the incredibly rude traits he has. 

I don't know how to explain how things got bad between us. It's just his personality, who he is, and I disagree iwth it, find it incredibly rude and invalidating to other people, and just let him know. 

 You're on the Scientology's 'enemies' list? What happened? You defintely didn't imply anythiing negative about Scientology, it's all good. People I know make jokes about Scientology and it's totally fine. I know what I don't like and don't agree it and I'm not sensing any of that from you. Another thing about Anynobdoy, is he DOES seem like everything is pro-Scientology, no matter what, and I've noticed that with some Scientologists, but that's not me, and that's wrong. I dislike a lot of Scientologists I've met because I can tell the kind of people they are and the kinds of things that they would do or think, and I'm just not okay with that. Scientology isn't some group that you join and become this ideal Scientologist and just turn into that. It's like when I go to the gym. I don't adapt the feeling and personality of the gym and the people in the gym. I go there to work my body, to use it as a tool. I do the same thing with Scientology. I really hate when people do that because what starts happening is they start feeling like they're better than others because they """"act"""" more like an ideal Scientologist than people who aren't doing that, and all sorts of other things, which I think our friend here might've done.  )

Hi. It's from the same user who was changing the images before on similar articles. Not to mention that, both images are good resolutions, contrary to what the user says, which is why I don't see the need to change images, delete galleries and remove content. It's unnecessary.   
It is nevertheless a content dispute. Neither the repeated switching of images nor the edit summaries that you consider misleading amount to vandalism, per Wikipedia:Vandalism#Types of vandalism and Wikipedia:Vandalism#What is not vandalism.  Donald Albury 

It was vandalism, but not mine.  Your images have extremely bad lighting and are not encyclopedic quality in the least.

Yes, I did use the language (on a talk page) and if it will make the booboo feel better, I apologize. But who doesn't enjoy a nice summer's eve?

BUT, you need to STOP LYING about me. I never said the Greaseman was dead, only that his death had been reported by sources considered reliable by Wikipedia standards. A little attention to detail on your part would be much appreciated, Eve. Otherwise, perhaps it is I who shall report you. Tell you what: you admit and retract your lie and I will consider the matter closed. Fair?

Let's look at your odd writing style: """"If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia,"""" Just what are you going for there?

I've never put a lie on Wikipedia, contrary to your assertion. Anyone who lies about me can go screw.

Your threat to report me to my ISP (FOR WHAT, EVE?) is beyond pathetic. Two pops for yes!! Report away.

Now, the admin who blocked me said that more than one reliable source was needed on sensitive matters.  He did not research sufficiently to reach a correct conclusion.

Let's all remember, shall we, that I never said that Greaseman was dead, simply that he was REPORTED DEAD.  There's a big difference, and the fact that it was reported is not in dispute.  I NEVER SAID GREASEMAN WAS DEAD.  Yet Neutralhomer continues to assert that I did.  THAT IS A LIE.  I consider someone lying about me a personal attack, under Wikipedia guidelines.  Is this a """"separate but equal"""" or """"separate and unequal"""" system?

The admin who blocked me wants more than one source that someone said something on the radio.  Let's look at Wikipedia's entry on Cesar Romero's personal life, shall we?  There is NO source cited for his death, nor his homosexuality, yet those are all sensitive topics, are they not?  Why doesn't Neutralhomer report the author of this page for vandalism?

The fact that Neutralhomer claims that dealing with me gave him a migraine on the talk page of the admin who blocked me demonstrates that this is a personally based effort on his part.

To recap: I never lied.  I never vandalized.  That should be enough.

Now let's look at Wikipedia's reckless report of Cesar Romero's death and homosexuality, shall we?  Sensitive matters, no?

Personal life

Romero believed in liberation theology. Romero was very Christian yet still believed in a utopian society whose belief is that Christ's kingdom would be very similar to Marx's envisionment of communism, and held to this belief until his death.[1][2]

Romero always claimed his grandfather on his mother's side was Cuban poet and patriot José Martí, although his mother's parents were legally Carmen and Manuel Mantilla with José Martí as his godfather. There was some speculation that Maria was fathered by Martí who was a boarder in the Mantilla household, but he never claimed Maria as his daughter in his lifetime.

Romero was never married, despite proposing to at least one woman. Romero made regular appearances on the Hollywood social circuit, usually in the company of an attractive actress, and he was almost always described in interviews and articles as a """"confirmed bachelor."""" Romero discussed his homosexuality in a series of interviews with author Boze Hadleigh, with the understanding that they would not be published during his lifetime.

Romero wore a man's tennis bracelet inscribed with his favorite nickname: """"Butch."""" The term was reportedly bestowed on Romero by his one-time dancing partner Joan Crawford, who teased Romero by telling him: """"You're so butch!"""" While Romero's homosexuality was an """"open secret"""" in Hollywood, the movie-going public was unaware of his sexual proclivities and there was never any embarrassing scandal surrounding his male liaisons, which shows the care and finesse with which he conducted his private life for more than 60 years.

Romero was a mainstay of the Hollywood social circuit until his death in 1994. He was interred at Inglewood",0,0,1,0,0,0

2690ef334051ceb8,"""Saab lofton was a radio personality for about two months of his before loosing his show on digital radio network. He will not provide proof of his comic roofis (as in did he actuall draw it himself or did he contract out the work while writing the storie. Both of his books (pamplets) are home published and could be considered very racist! This is not someone that has any creditibily as he has lied several times on his wikipedia page.

No RESULTS!
On June 12th, 2008 GLOBETREKER says:
This is not an example and cannot be proven that YOU actually drew THE strip.

Like I said I have been informed this comic in nothing more than 2 or 3 sheets of zerox paper stapled together. Not in the usual format as a printed affair. He uses the term loosely since it’s not a real printed comic. He has no examples of his drawing, what kind of cartoonist doesn’t put their work online. PROVE THAT SHIT!

He stated in this post to Wikipedia that his book Battle Neverending’s 3 thousand copies sold out in one year which is a total lie. He printed them in 1998 and was still selling them as recent as 2006

http://www.popocculture.com/28/battle-neverending-by-saab-l

“Jarvis Marlow is the man who paid out of his own pocket for the second printing (one thousand copies) and third printing (two thousand copies) of Battle Neverending. I sold all three thousand copies of Btl Nvrg within the span of a year”. 

(Example #1 of his lies)

2000 copies of A.D. supposedly sold in one year or as Saab states (Record Time) which is also unverifiable whether it actually sold that fast since he out an out lied about Battle Neverendings.
The first A.D. was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted.

“However, his claim to fame is the novel he wrote while still in the dorms at San Francisco State University, A.D., which was so radical a book it got him kicked out of college in 1997.”

When in reality

“Lofton wrote """"A.D."""" while a student at San Francisco State University and spent so much time hawking the book when it was published three years ago that his grades began to fall and the university cut off his financial aid”.

(Example #2 of his lies)

I ‘m not admitting any mistake about BERKELEY (you always want to appear very radical so I’m sure you told him you were homeless on the streets of Berkeley) because you made that up as well as being homeless! The only place you’ve been homeless was on your mothers couch for THREE YEARS ALL THE WHILE REFUSING TO WORK A DAY JOB, IM SURE TO YOUR MOTHERS AMAZEMENT ON JUST HOW MUCH OF A BUM HER SON TURNED OUT TO BE!

(Example #3 of his lies)

“In all the WEEKS you've been STALKING me, NOT ONE motherfucker has so much as e-mailed me and asked, """"is this anonymous, psuedonym-using piece of shit correct about anything?""""”.

I know nobody reads your shit anyway so I wouldn’t expect any response. I write these things simply because I know that you can’t handle risking your supposed fame! (Which is all you are interested in anyway). Your not an activist you’re an opportunist masking yourself in anarchy.

And finally I have this victory over your Racist Spoiled Black Privileged ass!

Here’s the dialog about shutting Saabs Wikepedia page because firstly it’s chalked full of made up shit and secondly they finally realize that he’s just another home publishing hack!

I've looked into the books listed in the bibliography... The first was published by a small defunct anarchist publisher which describes itself as publishing """"pamphlets"""", sold out and was not reprinted. The second was described by Pop Occulture Magazine as """"obviously a low-budget and quite-possibly home-printed affair"""". There is no evidence that either of these books received a credible review, much less meet WP:BOOK. Journalists are a dime-a-dozen and not automatically notable, and these books don't appear to establish notability either.

Therefore I am proposing deletion of the article. If the tag is remove, would someone please nominate for deletion? I can't as I can't create the deletion page... 67.67.219.223 (talk) 

I'll keep an eye on it. I also find it a little hard to believe that he was kicked out of San Francisco State for writing a novel that was """"too radical."""" -) Steve Dufour (talk)

You are continuing to misrepresent my original objection.  My objection was NOT that 'he didn't respond in 8 hours', or anything like that.  (You portrayed that as my objection, though!).  Instead, I objected that Dodo wasn't addressing MY ACTUAL OBJECTIONS.  Other than his 'driveby deletions', and a template or two, he DIDN'T respond to my complaints.  Not only  did he not address my objections within a day (as you implied my original complaint was), he didn't even EVENTUALLY address my objections!  Irresponsibly, and probably maliciously, you tried to make me look like 'the bad guy' for objecting to Dodo's repeated rapid deletions without waiting for consensus, etc.
Dodo was trying to act on the theory, 'if somebody does ANYTHING even arguably criticizable, I can slap him down repeatedly by deleting his edits, without waiting for any sort of consensus, etc.'  (Evidently, that is your position as well.)  I say, """"No!"""".  Dodo never, in detail, responded to my repeated and DETAILED complaints of his behavior.  Is the reason that 'he is busy'?  Well, if he's SO BUSY, 
why did he have enough time to repeatedly delete my posts?  Doesn't make sense, does it?  The answer is quite simple:  Dodo (and, I suspect, many other self-appointed 'Info-Nazi's' ALWAYS have time to slap down other users (that's EASY, and takes little time!), but they DON'T have enough time to actually defend their own actions when challenged!  Dodo (and many others) amount to semi-professional BUSYBODIES who strut their stuff by interfering with others' use of WP.  Stop it.

 Worlds sexiest big nice shaped behined """"Sandy Brunchone class of 1980"""" 
Sandy had a nice shaped rear when totally naked her crack was very deep and stinky, the asshole was wrinkly around but nothing hanging around the ends. I got a change to see her ass up close and personal one evening, she was naked as a J Bird and sitting in the front of the car drunk as a skunk. The she stated to get in the back set where I was. She put one leg over then another now she was in the back bent over in the front with her bare ass facing right at me. I couldn't resist, I griped both ass cheeks with both my hand and spread them apart, and then pushed my face right in her crack and sniffed up in there. And when she didn't resist and seemed to like it I decided to start licking her, right from her pubic hairs though her pussy over the crotch in and out of the asshole then strait up her crack while squeezing her ass cheeks all the time. God remember MaryAnn on Gilligan’s Island, that’s what her ass and body looked like. She then finely goes in the back sit and sat on my lap and I was fondling her Virginia.""",0,0,1,0,1,0

You are an atrocious liar, Bob Rayner. If I wrote in the value-form article I created that """"Thus, Marx aims to provide a brief morphology of the category of economic value as such, from the simplest forms to the money-form."""" that is perfectly accurate and neutral. Because that is in fact what it is. It is not controversial at all. By contrast, your arbitrary vandalism of other's texts has nothing to do with accuracy and neutrality, but with your own perceptions, biases and prejudices what is acceptable or preferable. You are fighting your own propaganda war in wikipedia, as shown exactly by what you deleted and added across time. That's bad, but what makes it worse is two things: the evidence is that you frequently have no real experience or competency with regard to the subjectmatter, and you provide no satisfactory explanations or discussions for cutting out very large parts of texts from articles written by others. I am therefore going to launch an arbitration procedure against you as soon as I get some time.

It's not that uncommon for vowels to be raised before nasals.  Take for example the pin-pen merger in Southern American English and in southwestern Ireland or the non-phonemic æ-tensing that takes place in accents that have undergone the Northern cities vowel shift.

Many English people might pronounce man as , which sounds quite a bit different from .

 A hit list for Jews 
There is a site called Jew Watch out there (I'll let you find the link) which specialises in """"keeping an eye on Jewish activities"""".  It is used as a reference site by anti-semites the world around.  Jew Watch makes it a point to make sure that they do not, under any circumstances, list someone who they cannot confirm 100% is Jewish.  Stormfront, a white supremist web forum, uses Jew Watch all of the time.

The criteria for inclusion on List of British Jews is the same criteria used by Jew Watch.  It is a criteria designed for anti-semites.  It is a criteria that is aimed in hurting Jews.

Jewish communities do not have such a criteria.  They allow anyone to be considered to be a Jew if they have any linkage with the Jewish community, through race, religion or culture.  This is the normal criteria that is used.  If your father is Jewish, then per Jewish community standards, you are Jewish.  And so forth.

Wikipedia as a whole has certain criteria for verifiability.  But these criteria are not being applied to this list.  This is being changed purely because this is a Jewish list.  Whilst Slim Virgin and her friends have claimed that this is in order to stop muslim terrorists, this is plainly not true.  If we are worried about terrorists strapping bombs to their bodies and blowing up Jews, then this list shouldn't exist at all.  And we should especially not try to focus on who are the """"real Jews"""".  Wikipedia are changing their rules, purely to push an anti-semetic point of view.  And while Slim Virgin goes around claiming that others who oppose her are neo-nazis, and ignoring their strong ties to the Jewish community, she herself has been unable to answer the questions about her own religious hatred.  And this is the same person who has supported muslim POV pushers, who have written vehement anti-semetic text throughout Wikipedia.  Slim Virgin has been a catalyst for banning people who have opposed these islamofascists.  Slim Virgin is an anti-semite.

Right now, I would encourage deletion of this list.  It is being run by anti-semites and used to harm all Jewish people.  Until such time as Slim Virgin can be banned from editing this and related pages, it is dangerous to continue to have such a page.  It is encouraging hatred of Jews.""",0,0,0,0,0,1

We can all tailor hypotheticals to fit our arguments, but they are irrelevant, practical application is the real test.

""""Do unto others as you would have them do unto you"""" is the oldest part of morality, it is a code to live by, if it is removed then simply in moral terms you can do what you like to people.

 Unwarranted remarks 
hello.  First of all, I'm very well aware of """"3RR"""", and secondly, you should be aware that I did NOT reach """"3RR"""" or violate anything.  Thirdly, it would be nice (for consistency's sake, but since I see favoritism and politics at work here) that you would give that same lecture to Malik.  Since he was reverting like crazy and getting close to uh """"3RR"""".  Of course you didn't, per your bias in favor of him, for some reason (a problem on Wikipedia that happens with Admins and other users...), and sided with his nonsense that somehow """"ICGC"""" was somehow """"not notable"""".  Never mind that they've been all over tv talk shows for years, guests on interviews, and in the radio, and even in the news.  Never mind that they've been around for decades.  And have internet sites for years.  You'll knee-jerkly take Malik's side on this, because after all, he's """"Malik Shabaz"""".  A bully on Wikipedia who is revert happy, and for some reason you favor.  I do NOT appreciate your remarks to me on his talk page.   I did not violate anything. NOTHING.  But Malik was arguably violating """"I don't like"""" and """"no own"""".  You'll deny that, because after all, he's Malik.  And for whatever reason, whatever he does or says, you (admin or not), seem to knee-jerkly side with.  So now that Malik has obvious back-up for his bullying and ownership violations (back-up from an imperfect Admin who is arguably a bully too doesn't bode well for me, does it) it's hard for me to do anything.  Yes, I'm angry.  Your remarks were obtuse and unnecessary.  I violated nothing.  Malik seems to think he owns a bunch of articles, as is seen from his history and pattern.  Yet you wink at it, or deny that, because, well, he's """"Malik"""".  Good day.   """,1,0,0,0,0,0

Again, you disgusting cretin, you accuse my statements of being laughable, yet have no logical basis to believe so. You think I believe my arguments are gospel, eh?

So you're the kind of sick bastard that would've condoned slavery just because everybody you knew did?

You're the bastard who has some sort of personal agenda attatched to this and for some reason or another, you refuse to have it changed, like a no-good dirty hippocrite.

Dude, sorry for the rough language, but you are one fucking dumbass idiot. Everything I type is extremely intelligible and free-flowing, if you will, yet you seem to interpret it WAY differently than it is obviously stated. My sentence, """"You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so"""", makes perfect sense and only an idiot would not understand it. I wrote it redundantly to prove a point, not because I lack verbal skills. The point being, that you are an idiot and you can't understand the symbolic (or even literal) nature of my posts, and you interpret it into something that somehow benefits you and your cozy little world view. Ok, this will be the 100TH time I've had to clear something up for you, but let me tell you what this sentence means:

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

If you discerned something other than this, than you are retarded, hands down. I can't understand why you make all these radical interpretations, especially when most of my words are plainly visible. I am in NO WAY contradicting myself here, and if you can't understand this, then I am in NO WAY going to argue with the mentally retarded, for the guilt would prevent me from having peace of mind for quite some time.

About the Standard English, obviously, this article was written by a British person, and is extremely POV, thus is not a valid argument against this issue. That's like basing all your knowledge about drugs on government and anti-drug propaganda. 

Please man, let's put some sense into this argument, and remove all the non-sensical bullcrap you've included into. And don't ever, EVEr fucking tell me to go away, got it?

This needed to be clarified since there has been a problem with him inserting subsequent posts ahead of mine, which can be misleading to a reader. When I tried to correct the positions yesterday in another incident, here is what he wrote in his edit summary when he positioned his post ahead of mine again:

01:57, 13 May 2010 The Magnificent Clean-keeper (talk | contribs) m (180,836 bytes) (Undid revision 361800511 by Zlykinskyja (talk)Don't fucking move my comments again. This is plain vandalism) (undo)

So when I objected to his use again of the word """"fucking"""" he then used it at me two more times, as reflected above. This follows a prior incident a few weeks ago when he used the word """"fucking"""" at me. I repeatedly objected and asked him not to do that. I think he did this again because he knew it would upset me because of how upset I was about the prior incident. 

Also, I have been called by someone else a """"bitch"""" and the words """"cunt"""" and """"cock"""" """"shit"""" have been directed at me on this Talk page. I have repeatedly objected and nothing is done. It is as if women who want to contribute here have to put up with a gauntlet of abuse if they wish to stay here. And no, it isn't unreasonable to object to such disrespectful treatment of women. This is not the 1950s. None of this should be going on.   """,0,0,1,0,0,0

response to your nasty personal attacks, Blockader and Blah
'You people are unbelievable in your ignorance and the ease to which you get brainwashed by subversive propaganda.
 Learn to read. I said that Paine and Jefferson came up with the ideas for a minarchist government whereby the freedom and equality of the people would  be protected. Have you read Paine and Jefferson? You are attacking the wrong men. If you want to rightfully attack an American forefather attack Alexander Hamilton and James Madison, and others.
 I never said they were anarchists. I do say, though that Jefferson expressed his admiration for anarchism. If he had suggested it at a congressional meeting he probably would have been shot or lynched or they just would have impeached him. (Something that many of them wanted to do anyway.)
 Being patriotic to your country and anarchism are not mutually exclusive. Sounds like you have been reading too much Communist propaganda. Communists just love to subvert governments and China is trying to subvert this one right now. I personally would love to overthrow the fascist-socialist state we're in right now and get back our freedom. But Maoism is not something I would have in mind in the way of freedom.
 Blah and Bockade, since you think you know the ideologies that are best for me, let me find one for you. Hmm, maybe subverting your current government into a dictatorshiptotalitarian state would be appropriate. Or perhaps, as you are incapable of reading comprehension or the most rudimentary thought, working in a convenience store, rather than editing what used to be an encyclopedia would be a good idea for you. Or maybe, how about going and fucking yourself. Now, after having  baited me with your ignorant and idiotic comments, go running to the admins and report me for PAing you, thereby proving beyond any shadow of a doubt how unanarchistic yet socialistic you really are.

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept.",1,0,1,0,1,0

Blocking me
I dont understand you're motivation for blocking me. You say I made personal attacks and the link I followed was the Qiyamah talk page..I presume you mean my comment that Universaliss was vandalizing it. Im not sure if you were confused or simply refrained from viewing his last two edits. His last two edits were what motivated me to my accusation. He replaced the page with utter nonsense. After you blocked me you didnt even rv his vandalism! I assume your decision to block me was an accident...but it does seem suspect...especially considering your recent and persistent need to engage me in convos which really dont concern you (Woohookity and that vfd consensus). I read your comment at southerncomfort's talkpage and I think you should know that I have not mislead her as i have never talked to this user. You said you blocked universaliss for a week...do you mean you blocked him/her yesterday and this will last for a week? No matter. I simply want that user to stop 1. reverting to old-outdated versions of the page which contain grammatical and technical inaccuracies, 2. stop the personal attacks, and religious attacks (towards Protestants, Jews, and Ahmadis), 3.and stop deleting information that he/she disagrees with. I really dont think this is asking that much. In terms of diffusing the situation...I tried to add in a passage that all parties could agree to. His response was too massively delete info in various sections and add in comments like """"you fucking troll"""".  03:26, August 1, 2005 (UTC)""",0,0,1,0,0,0

If you want to know why, read the Wikipedia:In the news/Candidates page. There you will find all sorts of uninformed, illogical, and downright dishonest claims about the UK legal system and the way the British press works. You will also see the quite idiotic claim that, by ignoring this news, Wikipedia is somehow defending Adam's from defamation - something apparently the rest of the world's media (and indeed Wikipedia's own article on Adams), isn't apparently all that concerned about. If like me, you think this is contemptible, and want to challenge it - then you will just have complain to your congressman I guess, because it has become clear to me today at Wikipedia talk:In the news that the people at Wikipedia who make those sort of arguments, will absolutely, positively, not answer any questions at all about it - and others will apparently defend their rights to do so, by closing down such discussions. Apparently it's 'disruptive' to question the logic that goes into faulty Wikipedia decision making like this. As always, if you want to know what's going on the world, consult the other 'old media' outlets who, for all their faults, still make it their job to report on the news in a serious and credible manner.

I also think it is mere rubbish but I also think it is not completely rubbish. According to the southeast asian history, most of the ancient rulers of this region are Hindus, some rulers came from Persia (map covered Middle east, Greece, west India - Achaemenid Empire, Seleucid Empire, Parthian Empire and Sassanid Dynasty, please look at the size of the map their conquered). Kedah is a good example where the king from Persia came and eventually he built a kingdom.

In the old days, it was slavery society (no sultanate and no democracy yet), all Hindu rulers belong to higher class, common peoples and the natives belong to inferior slave class. The Hindus rulers came from India and Persia and they ruled most of the southeast asia, they called themselves high class peoples, the rest are merely slaves. Parameswara is a Hindu ruler, he is one of the descendants of the Hindu royal family that belong to higher class of Hinduism.

As for the Macedonian bloodline, this is also not completely rubbish. In the old days, the Persian empire was so big, they are so proud with king Alexander the Great. Also, they ruled some of the southeast asian lands such as the Angkor, Pasai, etc. Parameswara later married Pasai's princess and adopted Persian Shah and claimed as descendant of Alexander the Great, I don't think all this is completely rubbish.

Anyway, please correct me, I may be wrong too.

Karljoos, you ignorantly state that the phillipines is a hispanic country? How in the hell is that possible? Phillipino people are not spaniard nor have there been any admixture between spaniards and phillipines over the centuries. Are you ok?

Also, according to europeans (not ignorant americans), hispanic is an admixture of races in south america. Therefore, spaniards are not classified as hispanic. 

Then you state that Spanish culture has taken root in south america. This is not wholly true. Although it is true that south americans have accepted parts of Spanish culture, they still retain features of their own culture that are extremely distinct from the Spanish culture. This is compounded further by south america’s distinct racial differences, which, if you were smart, you would indeed know.

Just for the record, I am of spaniard descent. I do not consider myself hispanic in the way that ignorant stupid americans do. All europeans don’t view spaniards as hispanic, as a matter of fact. 

Also, since stupid americans consider south americans hispanic, it should be therefore fair to classify afro-americans and native americans in america as anglo-saxons also. This is due to the fact that afro-americans and native americans possess a significant amount of their bloodline to anglo-saxon admixture. As a result, I will add this fact to wikipedia’s anglo-saxon article. AND I WILL BACK THIS UP WITH GOOD SOURCES. So, I better not get idiot americans disputing this.",1,0,0,0,1,0

It is very funny to learnthat a stupid fuck'in   is trying to clean up the Kamboja articles. This person himself is totally disoriented and utterly confused, mentally/intellectually; and it is also very clear from his comment somewhere else about Kamboj-related articles that he does not even know the very basics of the Kamboj history. It is really funny to know how this idiot (and his ilk) are confusing the Indian journal """"Gazetteer of the Bombay Presidency"""" with  the Handbook of the Bombay Presidency? How come these idiots, who can not even correctly interpret or understand the historical references/citations, be entrusted with the task to edit serious articles on ancient people like the Kambojas? It is  also amusing to learn that such-like dorks are trying to define the historical out-lines of the Kamboj history on Wikipedia! It is highly desirable that these fuck'in self-styled Wikipedia administrators/commentators first need to learn  to correctly interpret and interpret the historical references. Only then may they be qualified to comment on the serious topic like Kamboj history or else earn the rights to edit informative articles on this wlllknown ancient historical People. Also these jerks first need to understand that the citations and quotations used in the Kamboj related articles are from the most scholarly writers on this subject. It is shameful that these FEW F*- SELF-STYLED IDIOT ADMINSTIRATORS (LIKE DABU(DAB),ITSMJUDITH and the like) are trying to sit on judgement on the Kamboj history on Wikipedia and are bent on distorting or deleting the genuine information about them which is not found in the books writtemn in English, Fench or German by their European writers! Well, if you can interpret even the references quoted in an article, howcome can you sit in judgement and offer your scholarly comments on the Kamboj history? It is first necessary that these adminitrators/editors like Fuck'n Dabbu and his ilk, first need to familiarise  themselves about the current available historical information on Kamboj history-only then can they qualify themselves to edit the serious articles on the Kambojkas?'.And, I'll see how long these ignorant, prejudiced-minded idiots can continue to block me from editing articles on  Wikipedia?????''.

 Up to your old tricks I see 

Thankfully I have not had the displeasure or the need to smell your odious stench on this site for a while as thankfully wikipedia is large enough to avoid contemptible creatures like you.

However I notice we have crossed swords again with you crying out your age old mantra - like the fucktard you are - it's """"unsourced"""". Well done, fucking well done, you are so pig-shit thick and lazy rather than 1. do a little bit of work and find some sources yourself, you just delete stuff because it takes less effort, or 2. assume good faith. Most people don't make stuff up that they add. If you had one iota of sense in that pig-shit brain of yours, you would at least do a quick internet search to check the facts before having a WP:OWN fap and then deleting anything that you like. 

Personally I think, and I have said this before, you make absolutely no positive contributions to this site. Just looking at your edit log clearly shows you generate nothing or even bother to write something = er this is an encyclopedia. If you had your way, it would be whittled down to nothing. You have got talent or knowledge except self-importance because it's easier to be a fucking Rules Lawyer than an editor. 

I have nothing but the utter contempt for you because you cannot even do the most simplest of things and look up something. If Wikipedia is measured by the likes of you, then it's stands by the lowest common denominator: ignorance. Your application of sourcing is so fucked up and arbitrary it's laughable. Are you the sort asshole who needs to see it on the news to figure out the Pope's a catholic? etc After seeing what you have been up to butchering articles like a retard with a paper cutter, I pray to all things dark and evil that you will eventually fuck with one of this site's even worse self-important cunts.

Hi! You might be interested in the discussion at . Thank you.   

 Spanish heraldry 

As a respected contributor to the above article, you're probably best placed to deal with the issues with it. If you want to take it on, I believe there is a lack of: inline citations in particular; good English; and specificity - parts of the article explain heraldry in general, and are not sufficiently (IMHO) to be included in the article (eg. most of the Definitions section). Thanks, -  (t, c) 

 BCN-SIA discussion 

First, sorry because my poor english.

Hi, i don't want to start a undo-war or something like that, but the avionews post is only a rumour. It's a propaganda speech from a Milan SEA not a declaration of any SIA officer.

I've talked with the SIA spanish comercial manager and he says me that the italian SIA officers inmediatly deny that issue, nor the SIA-BCN cancellation, nor the FCO-MXP flights traspassing... and all is a simply propaganda from Milan in this moments of crisis. This was also confirmed by SIA London regional headquarters...

Unfortunately, I haven't found any italy/UK SIA press relase dennying the Milan SEA president affirmations but i think that informations that I have are enough to question the avionews article.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by  (talk • contribs)  

Because of that, I have """"twicked"""" the comment from """"until summer 2009"""" to """"probably until summer 2009, in which they could codeshare with other Star Alliance partners""""
In the article, the text refered (Today the SiA flights carry out the Singapore-Malpensa-Barcelona route but in short time the flight will be reduced to Singapore-Malpensa route, while the continuation to Barcelona will be assured by Lufthansa Italia), is not referenced as Bonomi's words but as an explanation by Avionews.
The comments is not anymore an affirmation but a puntuation between brackets. Sincerely, I fail to see your urge to remove it. Cheers. MauritiusXXVII (Aut Disce, Aut Doce, Aut Discede!). 

I don't have a urge to remove it. I don't remove it. I only explain it to you the situation.  —Preceding unsigned comment added by 85.58.34.97

ed480a9ec6e8a10b,"A classic BWilkins block, with all the familiar traits to experienced observers - brevity, arrogance and ultimately, ineffectiveness. In true BWilkins style though, someone else has to take his nonsense blocks to their inevitable conclusion . So take your bow Reaper Eternal, there's a good lad.

So here goes, BWilkins presumably blocked me because he thought I was about to OUT someone, yet in his incompetence failed to lock this page, so.....drum roll......User:Mo ainm used to be User:BigDunc, the account that 'retired' and never went back to editting the same articles, pulling the same stunts, or so the public record would have you believe.

Yes, that's the super secret information that the esteemed *arbitrator* Elen of the Roads thinks should be permanently stricken from the record, even though he's now the very conspicuous last man standing of a clique of Irish Republican editors who have been skewing Wikipedia articles for YEARS using the same despicable tactics, and are only now starting to be noticed by the sloths who work AE and be dealt with as appropriate (or 'retire' as they see the wriitng on the wall for their hard won 'reputations' as editors in 'good standing' who never got noticed by the dumbshits who are supposed to monitor editors for compliance with all policies, not just the easy ones).

Mo survives due in no small part to the fact that none of his mates ever had the good fortune of getting away with a mid-life secret change of identity, as well as the general cowardice of people like BWilkins, who usually run a mile rather than deal with something complex like GAMEing on Irish republican related articles. Nope, that's far too much like work for that lazy prick.

This change of identity is being covered up by Elen on the grounds of OUTing. Yes, that's right, Elen wants to stake her reputation on a patently ridiculous claim that knowing that Mo ainm is really a bloke called Duncan who lives in Ireland, is a violation of WP:OUTING, just to cover up the fact that she never bothered to verify whether this was 100% grade A bullshit before she started blocking people for calling it as such, those who were there at the beginning and know just exactly how this lucky cunt came to have this excuse land in his lap and save him from a complete FAIL in understanding what is and is not a CLEANSTART.

So here we are, with sponge brained morons like Reaper and detestible assholes like BWilkins continuing the farce with blocks and censures like this. So well done guys. Assuming neither of you has the backbone to do the necessary and end this farce once and for all by calling Elen out on her lies, one of you has to now ensure this post gets oversighted so she can continue this OUTing bullshit story of hers to cover her own incompetent deceitful ass. (ab)use of oversight is logged, so it's at least good to have more names added to the list of people who've enabled this bullshit for so long anyway, it was starting to look like a one woman crusade.

- From someone that you totally wronged with your bullshit and managed to get me to stop contributing very significant contributions to this site nearly a year ago now. (And I contributed a LOT in a short time and would have contributed SO much more had I continued. Things that I did: huge amounts of professional class photography given away for free (placed PD) on subjects (often providing the only pics, to this day, on the subjects in question), hundreds of pages formatted according to standards, huge amounts of latest subject matter information added and facts corrected (in some cases so new that this was the first place on the net to have it) etc. etc.) - and instead of helping me and being civil, sensible and using common sense YOU were more interested in defending a non-contributing user who (for no apparent reason) started a campaign of open violent threats, death threats, spamming and vandalism on me. You were having too much fun abusing your moderator privileges by placing temporary blocks on me, trying to stop me from making my point and trying to give this hugely offensive other user a chance to avoid a police investigation, by mod-vandalizing discussions on the subject etc. - against most other moderators (private) views even - they had the sense not to start a mod war on the subject. Your 500 page nerd-o-pedia rule-book and abusing it to the point of idiocy was more interesting to you. Apparently you felt that since you had read it, everyone else should waste at least as much time and read it too down to every last letter, or you were gonna use it against all common sense toward anyone who didn't - with no regard for the actual situation and reasons behind it, no regard for that individuals contributions, no regard for civility - and most of all, with no common sense applied whatsoever.

It's indeed too bad that most pages on nerd-o-pedia are starting to be shockingy un-maintained and obsolete, indeed dead now that the initial rush of contributors is over after a few years, and the fun is over for most people - as, the most brutal blow of all, moderators such as YOU have managed to destroy the morale of even the most serious contributors and have had them leave. They simply did not wish to spend too much time arguing or alternatively face putting up with arrogant admin behavior, because it always will start to take more of your time than contributions here, because of people like YOU, and how wrong the principles are how admins are selected here. It's all about brown-nosing with the crowd and building your giant online virtual ego and lick the ass of other even more OCD nerds who are already admins, and you're just a wannabe. 

Good ****ing luck trying to get anything edited or updated here in a year or two besides top 10 whatever pop bands may be popular at the time, the latest tv show pages and some other obsessive-compulsive nerdishm. Nobody is foolish enough to put up with the crap that comes along with the job, from people such as YOU.

For example, the pages on my subjects were very active till late 2006, and since that they have... well. Remained in the same form as the core contributors left them, as they left this site. No updates. I'm truly not the only one to eject. Not worth the effort to contribute when all you get is shitted all over, if you ever need any help.

It's kind of funny that an admin can burn out of this site too, but given your attitude back then, I'm not surprised you did. After all, there were some decent admins here back then (such as  ), and I'm sure there's a few now, but WAY too many nerds for whom it is the biggest thing of their lives, and they have to show it, and snoop their noses everywhere. But like I said, as even admins are dropping out, what do you think happened to the contributors? Many pages now are actually full of incorrect shit, because no people of expertise hang around any more to correct details, and newbies or worse, malicious trollers slowly degrade the content that once was at least somehow accurate and relevant. Admins will be happy to see updates to the page, but the fact is, most of the updates today are degenerating the pages, obfuscating subjects and adding factual errors and garbage.

And too bad you didn't quit a year ago, I might still be here, and there would probably be several thousands of lines, and few hundred articles more, along with maybe ~1000 more photographs.

 criticism of jesus/plucking eyeballs out/slavery 

Jesus has been criticized as vindictive, intolerant, prudish, and unkind. Several scholars have noted that he appears to condone slavery.
 
−TABTAB 
−TAB
The cardinal Avery Robert Dulles stated that Jesus “said not a word against slavery as a social institution"""", and believes that the writers of the New Testament did not oppose slavery either.  In his paper published in Evangelical Quarterly, Kevin Giles notes that Jesus often encountered slavery, """"but not one word of criticism did the Lord utter against slavery,” and argues that Jesus must have then condoned it.  
 
−TABTAB 

How come the Catholic removed this section in his words """"because it didn't appear to be criticism"""" is this a joke?  
−TAB
Friedrich Nietsche argued that “a war was declared on passion” in the Sermon on the Mount, in which Jesus says of sexual temptation: """"If thy eye offend thee, pluck it out."""" According to Nietsche, “Destroying the passions and cravings, merely as a preventive measure against their stupidity and the unpleasant consequences of this stupidity, today this itself strikes us as merely another acute form of stupidity. We no longer admire dentists who """"pluck out"""" teeth so that they will not hurt any more…. the Christian who follows that advice and believes he has killed his sensuality is deceiving himself: it lives on in an uncanny vampire form and torments in repulsive disguises.”[Friedrich Nietzsche, 1878, Human all too Human: A Book for Free Spirits, The Wanderer and His Shado, aphorism 83] """,1,0,0,0,0,0

I haven't been around the page much lately (sick of haggling over trivialities), but the last time I checked the lead was largely the one written my Mathsci (which I had tweaked a bit after the mediation was over).  As for my redactions, they were surgical, (carefully removing personal comments without affecting the meaning of the sentence), and mostly affected TechnoFaye (whose mouth consistently runneth over).  I redacted Mathsci's comments 3 or 4 times, as well as comments from several others - it had no impact on the discussion except to remove inflammatory wording.

Occam, Arthur is trying to insinuate that I'm guilty of some sort of malfeasance without actually coming straight out and accusing me of malfeasance, because has no evidence (or even a decent reason to believe) that I've done something wrong.  Plus, he thinks we're all too stupid to recognize that he's being uncivil when he does it indirectly like this.  If he wants to make an explicit argument against me out of this mess of hand-waving, let him.  As soon as he does, I'll take him to ANI and request he be blocked for gross incivility.

Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, one or more of the external links you added  do not comply with our guidelines for external links and have been removed. Wikipedia is not a collection of links; nor should it be used for advertising or promotion. Since Wikipedia uses nofollow tags, external links do not alter search engine rankings. If you feel the link should be added to the article, please discuss it on the  before reinserting it. Please take a look at the welcome page to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. 

Your edit here was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove unwanted links and spam from Wikipedia. If you were trying to insert a good link, please accept my creator's apologies, but note that the external link you added or changed is on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.

The external links I reverted were matching the following regex rule(s): rule: '[a-za-z][0-9]{2,}\.photobucket\.com/albums/.*\.jpg' . If the external link you inserted or changed was to a media file (e.g. an image or a sound or video file) on an external server, then note that linking to such files may be subject to Wikipedia's copyright policy and therefore probably should not be linked to.  Please consider using our upload facility to upload a suitable media file.

Please read Wikipedia's external links guideline for more information, and consult my . For more information about me, see . Thanks!   

Granted - yes, they are links.... but to PHOTOS intended for that particular entry. They are of the album, the tv show, and the video respectively.

I am astonished at the deep diarrhoea of Communism propaganda on articles such as this one on Fidel Castro. This criminal murderous communist (let us understand that no one is a communist only a fool can be a communist). This murderer is being glorified here in this space of wikipedia. 

Let us (at least me), we the ones that don't have the power of moderators, let us uphold reason and above all truth of facts and reality, that this pig by the name of Fidel Castro is not only a communist criminal but is a devil in its own right.

“""""argument by argument"""" (tm)”?  If you have to invent a fallacy then even you have to know that you’re grasping for straws.

Collect, we do not have to say “the world is regarded as being round by some members of the scientific community” any more than we have to say “water has never definitively been proven to be wet”.  While I would personally prefer that we said something like “Ham’s claims have been disproven by modern science” (because I think it sounds more authoritative), if it’s between “incorrect” or nothing then “incorrect” is clearly the superior choice because it is factually true.

And please don’t try that “all the intelligent readers already know he’s wrong so there’s no need to point out that he’s wrong” argument.  Every fringe-pusher and their uncle has already tried that tactic and it’s bullshit.  We can’t just allow Wikipedia to be full of rubbish and assume that the smart readers will filter the fact from the fiction.  76.107.171.90

{{unblock|DISCLAIMER: I do not identify as a Nazi, Neo-Nazi, Facist, Neo-Fascist. I do not accept or agree with the actions or views of Hitler or any other dictators in the world for that matter. I do not hate Jews... in fact I have many jewish friends...
Hello, although this is technically an unblock appeal, it is really only a reason to explain.... you won't be in a mood to unblock me when I'm finished talking... )
First of all I want to apologise, I should have thought before putting the giant swastika on my page. This is the reason for that... I have a few Jewish friends, and normally we sometimes make jokes about jews and christians and things like that. I never really make jokes about the holocaust, because that never go over well with them and it is not nice... well, apparently, a joke about jews being lawyers set one of my closest friends off who is not really a jew, but claims he is.... now he thinks I am a facist, nazi, and I hate jews.... i gotreally frustrated and annoyed and so I came home and started messing around on my userpage... Second of all, i would like to ask why it is not permissable to """"self identify as a nazi""""? There are several userboxes dealing with this subject. There is even a userbox that states, """"This user identifies as a Hitlerist! WHAT THE HELL?!?!?! You will let people say they support Hitler, but you won't let them say they are nazis?!? Being a nazi does not mean that you condone Hitler or his actions, it simple means that you support the theory of the politics behind Nazism.... you can be a nazi and not support the horrible eugenics policy. But if you are hitlerist, that obviously says you support all that... your arguement would of course be that it is offensive to jews.... well if you are taking that into account, then you should also ban anyone that says they identify as a communist. That can be extremely offensive to christians... if you want me to, I can talk about all the horrible things they did to christians in communist russia (with reference of a nice book). I think I will... one of the things they did was putting shackles on the ankles and wrists of christians with spikes of the inside that cut into your skin if you moved at all... and then they put starved rats into your cell that tried to eat you alive so you had to fight them off while your wrists and ankles are killing you. They also tied you to a cross and hung you upside down over a huge pile of other prisoners crammed into a small room. You were then forced to excrete over everyone. You were also stood upright in a box while they drove long nails into it. It was alright if you stood perfectly still, but you would have to stand there for hours and then your body would sway and poke into the nails. They also stood you naked in a freezer with a doctor nearby that signalled when you were freezing to death and then they would take you out and warm you up. They would do that for hours on end. Then they would beat you over and over again asking you to renounce Christ... the holocaust was horrible, but I would rather be gassed or hung by a nazi than endure those tortures for 18 years like one man who wrote a book about his experiences... so could you ban all communists please? 
My last comment is in response to Chzz's question about me making the 'gay comment' statement. Nowadays the word gay is used for two meanings... one is homosexuality and the other is wierd, stupid, dumb... i was using the second connotation.... maybe if you people didn't spend so much time on this gay... sorry... stupid online encyclopedia you would realize how the real world uses words...
Even if you unblock me (which you won't... )...) I will take a wikibreak... i don't want to become addicted to point of ruining my social life...... i have already recieved a punishment, never becoming an admin (the whole gay... sorry... dumb trust thing)... just know this... i would have enventually removed the swastika after I cooled down and because of your gay... sorry... dumb policy you have lost a serious editor... this whole thing has really annoyed me...
  
(P.S. Chzz, I have been on Wikipedia for 2 years... you think I forgot to sign my gay... sorry... stupid post? yeah right!)

Killer, I'm sorry that you have misread my unblock request. If you re-read it you will see that my use of """"pop-eyed chihuahua"""" there refers specifically, accurately and unequivocally to the dog displayed on your user page and not to you. I cited it to explain to why I used that imagery in the WP:PA, as otherwise it would appear inexplicably random. The explanation was not, as you seem to think, offered in mitigation. Indeed my original unblock request, which I condensed at the request of admin Hersfold, stated: 

The following will help the reviewing admin(s) to understand what otherwise would appear to be a random choice of metaphors.[...] Killer has a picture of a pop-eyed chihuahua dog on her user page,  captioned “I look like this”; and she is in the habit of referring to herself, in her sysopping summaries, as a dog   e.g. “Puppy has spoken.” Stupidly I exploited this canine imagery at Killer’s expense.'' 

I edited out that section along with others in an effort to comply with Hersfold's request.

My unblock request in no way implies that it is 'somehow OK to insult' you because you refer to yourself as 'puppy'. It simply explains where the idea for the canine imagery came from. It does not attempt to excuse my using it to insult you.

I have apologised, and still do, for my rude and offensive references to you personally in the WP:PA; and ask that you graciously accept my apology as sincere, which it is.   """,1,0,0,0,0,0

Since the vista article contains information about the anti trust situation which, since it seems some people here have got a mouthful of gate's balls, is mislabelled anti trust controversy. Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision, it'a court ruling, like it or not there's no controversy too that. Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial, to the tend bundy controversy, since any court ruling merits this label. 

Since there's a section on anti trust laws and vista, it's worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the court's injuction. And this does have bearing on vista. You can't quote the m.s. pr saying we don't know what they want us to do, it's all questions, or whatever else he mentioned, without an adjunct sentence, of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now. 

But of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista.

So like i said, if some fuckers had gone into the trouble of actually discussing any of that instead of reverted every single edit in a hitleric fashion, things would be different.

But for now this stategy of being a hawk on an article I wish to keep in a certain way, and being completely uncivil and rude about it, merits from my part a roayl, fuck y's all, take your mouths off of gate's balls and then we can talk.

 Really? 

YOU'RE CONTRADICTING YOURSELF! Basically your opinion of based on blindness and bullshit as far the """"evidence"""" you send me are considered.

Really? Puny pictures in which you can almost not see what her eye color is. You need a magnifying glass to see her eyes. Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

 You are one of the most pathetic administrators on this site. 

This is just plain sad. I am a susbcriber to Jane's Intelligence online, and I found the article easily. (you need to be a subscriber to access it, but it is certainly not hard to find). If you tally up the total UDA/UVF/LVF killed in the book lost lives (from 1968-1998) it shows 90 Loyalists killed by the IRA and INLA during that time period. The book """"The Irish War"""" also gives the number of 90, on the page I quoted, as does the Jane's intelligence report. That is THREE sources to the one source you quote. I am sick of having my hard work hacked up by some half-assed administrator who can't deal with the fact that his IRA article was full of innacuracies. I have contacted a friend of mine who is a senior administrator, you should be recieving an E-mail from him shortly. Unless you want your administrator privilages revoked, I suggest you either stop re-editing my article, or merge my facts with your own. I am pissed that I took the time to re-submit the article in the way you asked, and you are still throwing a hissy fit. You are one of the worst administrator's I have ever dealt with, you are the reason academics don't respect Wikipedia. 

PS. I realize you are a Loyalist terrorist supporter, and therefore can't deal with the fact that the IRA killed a large number of UDA/UVF/LVF members...but those are the historical facts, grow up and deal with it.

God damn, it doesn't matter IF I DO provide proof. As you will put a pro-russian spin on it anyway.
As you and your russian buddies did already numerous times. 

The reason this pro-russian bias on this article keeps reoccuring is because Ymblanter is an admin and possibly other pro-russian admins are allowing this. Also, your lack of understanding of a Neutral Point of View doesn't help either.

Tricky situatian you got yourself into here, shame that I don't have the time or the motivation to meddle is pointless discussions with people who are brainwashed into thinking that they have nothing to do with Crimea by their own government. 

Just open any site that isin't Russia Today, and you'll see the real situation in Crimea and not what Ymblanter or any of your russian buddies are trying to portray here. I've had numerous discussions with pro-russians and I know that you don't have the capabilities to think by yourself, even If you had - Ymblanter would come in and adjust it to give a false impression of russian """"uninvolvement"""" in the matter.

As a Conservative I think we need to LIONIZE Senator Kerry   
-    
- I think we need to add a section APPLAUDING Kerry's DENIGRATING AND INSULTING cheap shot insults directed at our brave soldiers in Iraq.   
-    
- After all, Senator Kerry just insured that conservatives will maintain control of both the House AND Sentate this year with his DESPICABLE comments.   
-    
- My DEEPEST condolences to Kerry apologists and liberal editors at Wikipedia (in other words, AT LEAST 90% of you.)   
-    
- In 2004, the dems and their LIBERAL enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Viet Nam, figuring it gave Kerry an edge. So they made it about VNam and thanks to our BRAVE HONEST HEROIC Swift Boat Vets for Truth, it was! LOL! (With additional props to Dan Rather.)   
-    
- In 2006, the dems and their liberal enablers at MSNBCCBSNBCNPRPBSABCREUTERS/AP wanted the election to be about Iraq figuring it gave Dems an edge.   
-    
- And thanks to Senator John Kerry, the Dan Rather of 2006, this year's election is about Iraq.    
-    
- Except not quite the way they intended. LOL!!!   
-    
-    
-    
- And no, saying it was 'joke' just won't cut it.    
-    
- This latest Kerry outrage totally fits the LONGSTANDING pattern of Dems hating and denigrating our troops. From Kerry's GI Joe outfit testimony before Congress in 1971 to Dennis Kucinich, to Howard Dean to a San Francisco (where Nancy Pelosi is from) supervisor saying we should SHUT DOWN our military, the antipathy is indelible.   
-    
- And saying, 'Hey! I wasn't trying to insult our troops, just our Commander in Chief!'   
- only makes it worse. The American Legion certainly isn't buying it.   
-

- Perhaps you liberal wikipedia editors want to attack them too!

 Dear soldier of the Wikipedia neo-nazi/communist dictatorship 
What the hell are you tlaking about. I did not re-creat any article about the formal Australian Worker's Party formaly known as the New Communist Party of Australia. I think you are high on the lies told by storm front. You the hell listens to storm front. Oh my god Wikipedia is becomeing a dumping ground for neo-nazis and altra lefties. Since I am the voice of reason. I just have to say one thing. Pleas read my reply to storm front. Here it is - Okay okay. Lats just get the fatcs right. This is what some nazi said on storm front
"""" Peter Watson (of Warwick, Qld.) has claimed to represent all sorts of groups, and - in forums - likes to pretend he is several people at the same time. He has a habit of claiming to be the President of organisations he has made up on the internet. He says he is 14 (or 16) years old.""""

Answere:- No I have not supported lotsd of groups. I have only supported the CPW , AWP (formally known as the NCPA). I was never a member of the People's Think Tank Association plus the PTTA never had a president. Plus I have only ever been one person. And that person is Peter Watson. This nazi must have a lot of time on his hands to look for information on me. So I can only come up with only one conclusion and that is simply that this man has no social or sex life. So I can only say on thing """"go get a life man and get a women"""".

Peter was President of the """"People's Think Tank Association"""" based in Warwick, which he says """"split from the Communist Party of Australia just recently and they publish the Caller""""

Answere:- I was never the president of the PTTA. The PTTA was never ever created. The Caller was a fake news paper. As fare as I know it was only ever printed once by some nazi. Since the PTTA was never realy so how cna it split from the CPA. So many questions and not enough answeres. The man just doesn't have a life.

Peter was """"President of the New Communist Party of Australia"""" and """"Chairman of the Central Committee"""" (this is in his Communist International News)

Answere:- I was the president but not the had of the NCPA. I was the chairman of the central commitee. But as you might know the NCPA and the AWP are the same group. The AWP change its name to NCPA but change it's name back soon after remember you stupid nazi.

Peter was """"President of the Communist Party of Warwick""""

Answere:- Only for a short number of times in the hsitory fot he party that I was the presidnet of it.

Peter also says: """"the New Communist Party of Australia (NCPA) , The People Think Tank Association (PTTA) and the Communist Socialist Workers Front (CSWF) did dissolve and absorbed into the Australia First Party (AFP)"""".

Answere:- The Communist Socialist Worker's Front never ever was created and never was real. It just goes to show that nazis just makes things up to help them selvs. The PTTA was never real. If you are aksing why I made the CSWF and the PTTA up well it was just for fun.

Peter has also set up the """"Australian Worker's Party""""

Answere:- This nazi (FairDinkum) is a idiot. I have said this many times that it was started in april was a split from the CPW that changed it's name to NCPA than change it's name back to AWP when it was kicked out fo the AFP. Not only are nazis stupid like FairDinkum but they also don't listen.

I am a Communist and believe in Marxist-Leninism. I am not retarted. Plus I am not troubled person or retarted. I have never said in my life that I was the king of the Communists or the Nazis. Once more the nazis made some thing up to make them selvs look better and sound better than other people.""",1,0,0,0,1,0

Purrum, look in the mirror mate because you're full of self-righteous opinions, views, hypotheticals, allegations, accusations, hearsay and fabricated information on Ronald Ryan. And, you have the ordacity to express them on Wikipedia! 
Tell us Purrum, why don't you also request deletion of every published """"hateful"""" opinions by Hodson, that have appeared in various media articles over the decades, for everybody to read? Common sense suggests that if Hodson demands her opinions on Ryan be published on the media, then it becomes relevant referenced material for Wikipedia. If Hodson doesn't want her opinions to be made public information, then she should keep her vile mouth shut. Therefore, I will continue to add every referenced article regarding Ryan on Wikipedia, for the purposes of fully informing and educating the public.
It's obvious that Purrum passes judgement on what referenced articles should be banned, deleted, sensored and replaced with lies - nothing but lies!

My assertion was not that """"alot of people read the blog"""" but that it is a relatively popular blog, meaning that it is popular enough to garner articles on the websites of Collegehumor, PCmag, and NPR. I apologize if a simple checking of blog hits is not enough to endow something with the long coveted """"notable"""" status which you so graciously endow. You misquote me further: I did not call Wikipedia a """"clusterfucked internet bureaucracy."""" I was referring to the system which allows certain users to override others simply based on their own personal experience, without any further insight. Listen, I understand that you do have to prevent spam on this website. I know that anyone could come in here and edit the page of a noted dignitary or president to say """"FUCK FUCK BBOOOBIES POOP"""", but my posting was relevant enough to instigate investigation and your deletion of it amounts to an ego trip in that it simply regards the information I posted as irrelevant, despite the fact that my previous posting of it on this website lasted for months before being taken down. I assure you, I am not trying to spam up or fill the already expansive page about Marmaduke with misinformation. I simply want to let people know about a blog I enjoy which is critical of Marmaduke. I am acting in extremely good faith, and have all the freedom to call the levels of bureaucracy on wikipedia a """"clusterfuck"""" and to call your edits an """"ego trip."""" God forbid I should question your authority on the subject. I would appreciate it if you didn't try to condescend me.

Let's see, accusations of parroting, arbitrary classification of users based upon pen-name preferences, straw-men, ignoratio elenchi, and finally begging the question through the same fallacious reasoning as previously. We call that petitio principii, don't we? Apparently nothing will change his mind until I change my pen-name to something like John Doe. How does he know that I am not this Russian dude who likes Iranian history and culture? Oh, that's right, he doesn't. He probably didn't check my IP-address to see that I'm based in Sweden and could in fact be a Swede. Whoops... Sounds like our neutralist is using a subtle profiling method to his convenience.

Like I stated before, it doesn't matter if I'm a Nazi, Communist, Liberal or even a hippie. It doesn't matter if I do drugs, or if I look even remotely like a reptile. It doesn't matter if I'm even an obese Tongan kid. It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument, and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation. This is aptly called speculation.

Now, I will only say two things. First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion: Livius.org is visited by thousands of people daily. Along with a number of other scholar-related websites, I can't live without checking it by a daily basis. It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!

Second point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.

This article suggests that using """"bitch"""" to describe a young woman is exclusive to hip hop culture. This is not the case. This is THE prominent term to describe a woman in the African-American community. How many black people do you know who actually call a woman a woman? None. They all say """"bitch"""" as in """"Ah fucked dis bitch las' naht nigga. She wa' FAAAHN."""" Black people will NEVER say """"woman"""" because it is ingrained in their culture to be derogatory towards women! THAT is why it is used in hip hop, because that is black entertainment. Misogyny is a crucial element of African0American culture and this is why black people throw around the word """"bitch"""" as a synonym for """"woman"""". It's the same way how black people never call a song a """"song"""" they will always call it a """"track"""" and if you call it a song the black people will think you're a """"square"""" ad """"not hip."""" That's how they are and it should be in the article.

 WIKIPEDIA IS COMMUNISM!!!! 

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as she slept. The feel of her pajama-covered breasts against me was a welcome sensation, as it h",1,0,0,0,0,0

 Censorship 

Was Final Fantasy VII censored at all? I mean, the content wasn't as strong as, say, Final Fantasy VIII's, but I would imagine something was censored. Plus, it doesn't say anything about censorship on this page. Could someone please answer to this? 
Not that I recall. It certainly wasn't censored as much as the older games were.  
As I recall, some language was censored, some wasn't.  
The word """"bastard"""" appeared on various occasions, but """"fuck"""" and """"shit"""" were censored.  
< recet indent
Some words were censored, some were not, which ones seem arbitrary.
Only instance I could find of """"Fuck"""" uncensored:
Computer: Cid! We have an emergency situation! A mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket!
Cid: What!? Who is the little fuck!?
Computer: I don't know. Activating the intercom in the engine section.
Cid: Hey goddammit!! Who the #*$$#&'s still in there?
Earliest instance of """"Shit""""
Shinra Manager: I'm not give in to violence…and I'm not giving you my seat either!
Tifa: Barret!!
Barret: #^*$!! You lucky #$#*!
Cloud: So, what are we gonna do now?
Barret: Shit! The hell you so calm about? You bustin' up my rhythm…
In total, """"Fuck"""" is said uncensored once, """"Shit"""" is said uncensored 12 times, """"ass"""" is said 15 times (sometimes occuring as Jackass), """"Damn"""" is said 68 times, and I couldn't find any occurances of """"Bastard"""".  Censored words appear approx. 33 times.  
My version must be different.  The """"fuck"""" is censored, and the comment with Barret the last editor quoted, the first word was uncensored(though it had an apostrophe stuck in the middle, making it """"shi't"""".  I noted a lot of uncensored """"ass"""" and """"shit"""" though, and after playing FFX and FFXII for so long, going back and playing FFVII, I was a little surprised by the language.  In fact, it's the only Fantasy RPG I've ever played with uncensored profanity.  But yes, it was at least partially censored. 
 Nevertheless, unless we get concrete primary sourcing from an interview or whatever, we can't include this in the article. — er 
Well, the box says it's rated teen for mild language and violence...  But I'm not sure of any primary sources that would even deal with this particular issue.. 
Beyond a mention that there is some uncensored language I really don't think this type of info belongs in an encyclopedia.  And even the slight mention is iffy to me.   
Well, it's the first Final Fantasy to come to America with any uncensored language.  But then again, all the Final Fantasies to come to America in that period of time had to go through Nintendo of America's censorship guidelines of the time. 
It might be worth noting (at least in the discussion) that the computer version was far more censored than the PSX version. Almost every instance of """"shit"""" was removed, consistently with #^$& or similar characters. Also, certain important lines had their translations changed. """"Back then, you could get by with only skinned knees"""", for example, was changed to something likely more grammatically correct, but weird to a long time player of the PSX version.  

I have the PC version of FF7 and I recall a TON of Cid lines where there was censorship as well as ones form Barret. They were all situations of anger though so it didn't impact the storyline much.

Actually there was some sexual censorship if I recall. """"Slightly stretched underwear"""" was changed to """"Therapeutic underwear."""" Not sure why it's better, but I'm pretty sure they did it because they thought """"slightly stretched"""" was sexually inappropriate. (The item is found in Tifa's dresser drawer during the nibelhiem flashback sequence.)

{{unblock|HAHAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA UNBLOCK ME OR I WILL VANDALISE MORE!!!!

It had been six years since we had graduated from college, and for the first time since graduation, all three of us were together again. From the enthusiastic hugs at the airport and then the conversation and laughter during the dinner we shared at a local restaurant on the way to my home, it was clear that while plenty of time had passed and we had kept in contact, the comfort and attraction between the three of us when all together in the same physical location was still undeniable.

Having returned to my cozy, semi-secluded home in the suburbs, we all sat in the living room, sipping wine and continuing the tales of our lives. With the exceptions of the location – a house – and the presence of alcohol, it could have been any of our final two years of college together: The three of us, tight-knit friends-with-benefits, sitting and chatting and sharing a drink together. Then, Justine and Beth had been roommates while I lived in another dorm across the main quad; now, they were much-welcomed guests who had fortunately been able to clear time in their hectic schedules to come and visit me for a weekend.

As I sat in the recliner and took another sip of wine, I allowed my eyes to truly linger on Justine as she told Beth about a recent situation at work. The Florida sun had certainly added a glow to Justine's skin, and may have also been responsible for the lighter shade of her shoulder-length brown hair. As when we were in college together, she wore virtually no make-up, just a thin gloss upon her lips – an enticing strawberry flavor, as I had discovered upon meeting her at the airport earlier in the evening – and red fingernails. Her red dress was indeed elegant, with a plunging sequined neckline that permitted a very welcome display of her cleavage, a display which Beth and I both certainly appreciated. The long slit up the skirt of the dress revealed that she was wearing stockings held up by a garter belt, one of its descending white straps definitely noticeable against the well-toned thigh. The red heels provided enough of a contrast for the white stockings to truly attract the eyes. Surprisingly, however, she wore hoop earrings, something she had never worn during college for fear that they would pull at her ears and widen the piercing holes more than was considered safe.

The conversation turned back toward me, but a few minutes later, the two beautiful young women were again chatting primarily to each other. I took the opportunity to once again study Beth, and was equally impressed. While noticeably shorter than Justine, Beth was also paler in complexion, a testament to living in northern Canada ever since graduation and spending virtually every waking moment inside to conduct her research. As in college, Beth preferred the color black for her outfits: a somewhat-tight sweater, form-fitting slacks, and a pair of low heels. Four tiny earrings adorned each ear, plus she bore a small sparkling stud against her left nostril. Beth's black hair flowed over her shoulders and down her front, and she absently twirled several strands around a finger as she listened to Justine.

It felt so good to be in their presence once again. Especially since all three of us had been in several failed relationships since graduating from college, I was thankful that I had thought to invite them to spend the weekend with me. I had absolutely no doubt that our chatter would eventually give way to intimacy, but for now, I was quite content to simply sit back in the recliner and openly admire the two stunning beauties perched upon the sofa.

The intimacy began when we finally went to bed... together. I was on my back under the covers, with a very feminine head resting softly upon each shoulder. An arm wrapped around each of them, I held the two women close to me as they absently stroked my bare chest, dipped a finger into my navel, brushed my thighs through the sweatpants I typically wore to bed, caressed my stiffening manhood. My eyes closed, I reveled in their touches: inherently familiar, yet full of rediscovery due to the lengthy passage of time.

No words were needed. And as their hands occasionally made contact with each other upon me, I smiled to myself in the darkness, having always enjoyed watching Beth and Justine in their own intimate encounters. But eventually, their touches slowed and ultimately ceased, their breathing falling into the regularity associated with sleep. I stayed awake a little longer, immensely enjoying the closeness with two of the people who had been most important in my life.

I awoke in the morning to the scent of French Roast coffee, faint yet unmistakable. Justine was gone, clearly the one who had brewed the morning nectar, while Beth and I held each other as sh",1,0,1,0,1,0

I knew there was something wrong with those assholes when i saw them the first time. Guess I'll have to abandon this account. Hey  you still need to learn how to read links! Don't think I forgot! This isn't funny asshole! Guess what? I have been using another account and you don't even know what it is since the very first time I was blocked! Ha, keep playing your games, you aren't preventing me from editing piece of shit. Oh and  don't think I forgot about your 5 year old temper issues when anyone tries and fixes issues with your precious Dreamcast punk ass bitch. Lol, you guys did a number on this account. Probably found out what program I was using for the first BS account you made. 

I am impressed with how much damage you have done to this account, but it really means nothing when I am still editing every day on my personal internet and you have no idea which account it is. Oh and no it's not using a proxy or a public wifi spot. Heck, I may even try reporting this, all you idiots did was use proxy's, if I post on this account on my personal connection, and THEN appeal this I might just get my account back and get you idiots banned. I know exactly what you are going to do after this to wait until I log off, and then pounce with a new account. Sadly, looking at all this crap in my talk page, an admin would have to be retarded to not see how many of these """"accounts"""" that are proxies and not actual connections. You can only hide the smell of rotten fish for awhile before someone notices.

Shit, may was well clean this shit up. 

Oh wait a second one more thing, , what kind of retarded admin are you when having a bunch of almost all accounts pretending to be me are all on proxies and not ONE of them acts like me (did you even see my history?), and not one uses a real connection? Got that brain damage you do. had to put that in bold to be clear. Warning me about an indefinite block, lol, what does that matter, you already screwed up noticing what a 5 year old would have noticed by now. Any person would be frustrated by the silliness of this nonsense. I would appeal but something tells me to much shit damage and retarded admins will make this impossible, and I would rather not use the IP of my other account (using a real connection n my personal internet) because then you guys will probably be jackass and deleted for fun, look at this page! All this shit and nothing clicked in your small head? Amazing wikipedia. 

Also I need to take note to stay away from low ranked video game pages and focus on popular until you guys get tired of the act.

Also I KNOW you guys got an account that is going to post a bit after I submit this post I SAW him and he did the EXACT same thing 3 of the duded did, you guys need help, I can't believe not one guy was not like """"this shit don't make sense"""" for a whole second. Amazing.

Alright, so clean this page and leave this message here. Erase other extra crap. Alright, looks like we are in business. BTW, I know this is probably bull, but if any of you two actually are not trolling, which is highly unlikely, than post request an admin to come by so I can clear this account up. But I have this sinking feeling you guys all knew what's been going on here this whole time, and I have no patience to search through tons of pages to find ONE contact I can talk to about this block, so you might have this account, but you won't get the other one. Suck doesn't it? Until then, I will be going about my day and you guys will most likely probably still be doing this for X amount of days cause I guess you think it's funny? Yeah.

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!

One of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.

I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.

The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.

Keith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a """"Mutt and Jeff"""" in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1"""" but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.

Karen and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.

We were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.

""""There were some really desperate people here tonight,"""" she said. """"Can you believe Gary tried to get a game of Spin the Bottle going?""""

""""I can't say I really blame him,"""" I answered with a grin. """"Not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends, or any girlfriend for that matter. Hell, I wouldn'd mind playing it now!"""" That earned me a poke in the ribs from Karen.

Sue chimed in, """"Why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like Spin the Bottle, Post Office, or Strip Poker?""""

""""Now that's a stupid question,"""" Keith answered.

""""And why is that?"""" Linda asked, pointedly.

""""Isn't it obvious?"""" Keith replied.

""""No."""" Linda and Sue answered in unison.

""""Do you want to tell them?"""" Keith asked me with a nod.

So I explained the obvious. """"Because they ARE desperate - and sometimes it works.""""

""""Oh please!"""" Karen said.

Keith was a real instigator. """"You guys have never played Spin the Bottle?""""

The girls looked at each other. """"Maybe a few times, but certainly not in the last year."""" Linda finally answered.

""""And how about Truth or Dare?"""" Keith continued egging them on.

""""Well sure, but usually only with people we know really well,"""" Karen answered this time.

""""Usually."""" Keith echoed with a grin. """"And it's not like you've never played Strip Poker.""""

The girls looked at each other quietly no one answering.

""""Oh come on,"""" I teased, """"Karen I know you've played Strip Poker.""""

""""Not really. I watched part of a game, but then they chased everyone not playing out of the room. Why? I suppose you've played it?"""" She asked with a dangerous tone in her voice.

""""Sort of. In camp we started a game but it got raided before we got anywhere."""" I confessed, drawing a laugh from the guys. """"L",1,0,1,0,1,0

What a complete crock.  By calling everyone under the age of 18 a """"child"""", which the dictionary correctly defines as a human between the ages of infancy and puberty, you can make everything even remotely sexual sound salacious and evil.  Teenagers are insulted to be called """"children,"""" and if you start using terms like """"teenage sex"""" and """"teenage sex with adults"""" to describe problematical behavior by kids old enough to know better, the """"poor little abused children"""" angle is more difficult to sell.  Maybe we should just go to the ultimate extreme, and legally define everyone under 18 as a """"baby.""""  Then all sex with minors could be """"poor little babies being abused and raped,"""" which would no doubt please the Judith Reisman's, John Ashcroft's, and David Finkelhor's of the world.

""""Philip knew the dangers that de Molay represented; his own sons were nearly sexually molested by de Molay. Upon escaping the vile pervert, they confessed to Philip what de Molay had tried to do.""""

The section """"Engine and means of starting"""" contains the sentence """"Before starting a Model T deul fucking power with the hand crank, you had to retard the spark, or you stood a chance of damaging the starter or having the hand crank spin around wildly and break your arm.""""
I think that """"deul fucking power"""" is extraneous (and misspelled.) I attempted to edit the document but did not find the additional text in the text offered for editing.

=The authority of the user Node_ue in the matter of languages

Mark Williamson also known as Node_ue is a kid of 16 years old. (Born at 1989-08-18, Scottsdale, Arizona, United States [] )

What is the authority and credibility of this kid in the matter of languages? He didn't finished his highschool yet. All other words are useless …

Who is Node? Who is Mark Williamson? Just look at the picture:

Poor little Node having problem with languages! Sic!

I think Mark Williamson known also as """"Node ue"""" is having difficulties  with the words out of his mouth!

Nevertheless the authority of Node_ue is very good presented by himself in [] 

Just take a look the way the Kid Mark looks himself: (Warning! May be in various ways interpreted!) 

Mark is an all-powerful entity made of pure energy. If you know him, you will be blessed and your dreams will come true (or at least they might).

Strengths: All powerful, handsome, smart.

Weaknesses: NONE!!! THE GREAT MARK HAS NO WEAKNESSES! HE IS ALL-POWERFUL!

Special Skills: All-powerfulness, intelligence, &c.;

Weapons: All-powerfulness... sharp teeth... hrm...

All-powerfulness: YES! THE GREAT ENTITY KNOWN AS """"MARK"""" IS ALL-POWERFUL!!! YES!

Link to: []

Of course his ass is so painful….Guess why?!

Node's origin as a faggot (gay)…

[] (where he admits he is a faggot)

""""I've also noticed a few things that are possible hints at his thinking he's homosexual/bisexual but not wanting to admit it to himself:
He lies quite a bit to make himself look more """"masculine"""" (apparently he's the most popular guy in school with the girls, and he has to run quickly if he wants to get away from them), he is always going on about how much more attractive he is than me (according to him, this is because both of his parents are of 100% Jewish ancestry, while I only have 3/8ths [3/4ths of the people on my mother's side]), he goes out of his way to make extremely offensive jokes about homo/bisexuality, he goes out of his way to make it look like he's a homophobe, and at the mention of anything even remotely related to homosexuality he has so much disgust for it that he must show that you could fill a whole encyclopedia with his """"ewws"""" (not really meant seriously, according to him).""""

Constant ingestion of burgers and fries makes them feel to be experts on all things even those of which they know nothing and have n personal experience of.

Harry the Dirty Dog  seems to be adamant that he knows the Hasnains and that they are out of the country or have been arrested. I think there is a bit conflict of interest. This news was taken out 1 year old traced back to the Mercury news. The name of Pakistan and a beauty pageant has made it interesting enough. So far and far, Harry the Dirty Dog  this user is doing vandalism and it seems he is not allowing for us to remove the non-reliable sources and references. 
Also this user seems to have a personal agenda to secure this as far as possible, and seems to me, this user Harry the Dirty Dog  is on a personal agenda of defaming this lady. There is no proof and this is a rumour according to me and is supposed to be dismissed. If any one needs to research then one must google up and find out what she is up to! 
Harry the Dirty Dog  is on a personal agenda and seems to be one of the people trying to defame her. This news is one whole year old with no follow up! SUch are labelled as rumours only!

  Are you fing kidding me? There are 30+ reliable sources listed in the pre-vandalism history of the page. This debate in this talk page has no importance and will not receive justice. I am making my objections public for the sake of posterity alone. If you want to see the sources:

 Go look at the history of the page pre-vandalism.
 Go look at the history of the talk page pre-vandalism.
 Go look at the previous AfD discussion where 30+ sources are extensively discussed and analyzed, and consensus found that they were reliable according to the wikipedia definition of """"reliable"""" which you have not familiarized yourself with. 

This debate has already been done and it's very visible in the history of the page and the previous AfDs; the history which has not been consulted by the current deleters attacking this page. Without an """"admin in my pocket"""" my claims fall on deaf ears; I understand this all too well. If you or your allies were interested in due process, you would examine the history instead of asking that all that labour be repeated. Your kind will always demand that others do all the work even when it has been done in exhaustive detail. When you've read this entire page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/The_Law_of_One then you may speak without embarassing yourself. Anyone who has not read that entire page and understood the poles of the debate speaks from ignorance and exposes themselves as lazy deleters happy to erase hours and hours of work without a care. Shame on all of you for your intellectual laziness, dishonesty, and irresponsible deleter reflexes.

It seems to be that you're a loser who needs to brag that you troll Wiki and block users who try to make the site a better place. Most of your stuff is done in secret, but when somebody does expose you for being a trolling loser, you simply block them from even being able to talk on their own talk page. Guess what?

As you are aware, anything that i do gets reverted for no reason mainly by you; you use the WP:3RR the WP:SOCK and that stupid conciseness rubbish for your protection when really you know you are just doing it to be difficult and generally annoying. 

As i saw at the top of your page, and i quote from another twit that You are doing nothing to improve the article by constantly reverting - this occuring regularly in the following:

Louise Henriette de Bourbon-Conti - probably the best example of your obsession with having everything that way you want it; 
Henrietta Anne Stuart - i rearranged the page and added the Template:House of Stuart - clearly a tragedy;
Louise Marie Adélaïde de Bourbon-Penthièvre‎ - added titles and styles - where are they; i even tried to compromise by removing the stlyes and putting back the titles but once again you must have your way;
Victoire of France‎ - changed the awful layout along with her sister Princess Louise-Marie of France and Princess Marie Adélaïde of France 

Why?

The latter is quite amusing to me proving that you dont even read the article - you simply revert back because I did it - all I did was move the Template:House of Bourbon (France) to a different part of the page! Then you and your chronic arrogance go and revert it under the claim that there are rv excessive, redundant trivia contained in other articles then as always you groan on an on about the usual rubbish with please don't violate WP:3RR or WP:SOCK WHAT IS YOUR POINT ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Shut up!

Where is this claim about the WP:SOCK even from  - another one of your ridiculous  thoughts. I will not back down. 

I have a small bit of advice for you: maybe you should read the WP:OWN article for your own clarification on the matter. You really are a bore; and a selfish one at that.

4fff8b434eb6241f,""":It is neither more historically correct, nor more professional. Scholars routinely use the term """"Nazi"""". You cite the Encyclopedia Britannia as evidence of your claim. But, in fact, the Encyclopedia Britanica uses Nazi an order of magnitude more often than National Socialism. In the online version of the Encyclopedia, there are 10,200 references to Nazi and only 1020 references to """"National Socialism"""". And in the title of the entry for """"National Socialism"""", they write """"also called Nazism or Naziism"""". 

Your claim that use of the term """"Nazi"""" is amateurish is a slur on the overwhelming majority of scholars who routinely use the term. The claim that """"National Socialism"""" is a """"more full and correct designation"""" is inconsistent with the fact that the two phrases are synonymous. And while it is true that """"Nazi"""" can be used as an epithet, so can """"dog"""". Do you also recommend that Wikipedia refrain from using the word """"dog"""" to describe dogs? 

It is interesting that you use Linder as support for your argument. The particular passage that you link to is an explanation by Linder as to why he will use the term """"Nazi"""" rather than """"National Socialist"""" throughout his book. I fail to see why this is evidence that Wikipedia should do the opposite.

I am curious about your statement that use of the term Nazi arises from a deeper intent by political opponents to give a skewed view of their politics. What part of Nazi politics do you feel has been skewed by their political opponents?

Sir,

It has come to my attention that despite taking advantage of our first-rate American education facilities, you insist upon identifying as a Bangladeshi.

My parents are/were Bangladeshis, and they were amongst the most wretched people I have ever had the misfortune of knowing; Indeed, during this unfortunate period of my life that I have been forced to spend in Bangladesh due to my father, I am now convinced that Bangladesh is the single most unworthy nation to exist. (I use are/were because, I regret to say, my mother was struck dead by Bangladesh - and despite her dysfunctional state and pathological lying, I mourn her loss greatly.)

Never have I felt more love for my country than now, when I find myself forced away from it! I have now given my loyalty, heart and soul, to the United States of America: The greatest country in the world, God bless every inch of it.

But after my experiences with Bangladeshis, I cannot allow for one such as yourself to leech off of the United States while offering nothing in return. I implore you to either renounce Bangladesh and enjoy the remainder of your life in the blessed free world, or get the fuck out of my country, you filthy ape.

Sincerely yours,

A proud AMERICAN",1,0,0,0,0,0

Oh, so I was banned for quoting the Torah! Excellent, the admins here are banning for """"personal attack on gays"""", when you recite The Words of The G-d, but no one was banned for saying, that holocaust victims were gays and gypsies! More than six million people died in holocaust just because they were Jews, the statement at which I got angered is was of accusing martyrs in concentration camps in sodomy, which IS one of the greatest sins, according to BIBLE - Old Testament, TaNaKh and the New Testament, B’rit Chadashah of Messiah Yeshua Ben Elochim, Jesus Christ the Son of G-d, that Ta Bu Shi Da Yu never tried to read... These are pure actions of anti-Semitic and Heretic propaganda, some sort of modern faschism...

Hello again, Tdadamemd. Getting right to your comment about slang, I don't understand your stating that """"fuck"""" is not slang, or your linking to dictionary.com as proof that it is not. The word """"fuck,"""" while vulgar, is also slang; the dictionary.com source you cited even states so. It makes it clear that it can be slang for a variety of things, including sexual intercourse/other sexual activity. It list 13 numbered examples regarding what """"fuck"""" can mean. As for Wiktionary, I don't refer to sources like that. And, yes, I am fine with mentioning """"fuck"""" (or """"fucking"""") and the euphemism """"sleeping together"""" lower in the article, in the the Definitions and stimulation factors section, as alternative words for sexual intercourse/sexual activity. But again, there are a lot of terms for sexual intercourse, most of them slang. That these terms exist doesn't mean that all of them should be in this article. In fact, most times when there are many alternative terms for a word, especially if those terms are slang, we don't include all of them. As you know, this is an encyclopedia and not a dictionary. 

If WP:CONSENSUS is achieved for including your proposal, I'll add it by briefly summarizing that there are various vulgar and/or slang terms and euphemisms for sexual intercourse/other sexual activity...such as """"fuck"""" and """"sleeping together"""" (the wording won't be exactly like that, of course). And, really, because there are so many terms for sexual intercourse, and """"fuck"""" is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse (by that, I mean that most people and sources are not discussing the word """"fuck"""" when discussing sexual intercourse), that is probably why """"fuck"""" isn't currently in this article. Someone who is aware of your having repeatedly added it to the lead expressed to me via email me that """"fuck"""" is also U.S.-centric; so that's also something to think about, though the term is also used outside of the United States. 

Also, sexual intercourse does not = fuck. It's that fuck = sexual intercourse; in its literal sense anyway, since when people use the term...they are usually using it as profanity. That is also why I told you """"The Fuck article mentions sexual intercourse in its lead because it is especially relevant to the topic. However, the term 'fuck' is not especially relevant to the topic of sexual intercourse."""" 

I cannot see how this article is broken simply because it doesn't currently include """"fuck."""" But, like I stated, I don't mind adding it to the article. I'd rather see what others have to state on that matter first, however.   """,1,0,1,0,0,0

Ever thought about """"Soviet Jews"""" phenomenum?

Real Russian people were killed only as """"rivals"""", because of _war_ and not the _holocaust_!

P.S. For homosexuals killing, mentioned above - I would have killed them all if had a chance! Really, killing homosexuals is not a sin, according to Bible. AND, homosexuality was widely spread in 20'th century Germany, so i doubt they were really persecuted... Hitler stated himself that that were Jews', who dont'let Germany win the First War, and all other casaulties were mostly accidental... And, of course Soviets, who protected their counry agains the invaders were regular victims of WAR, not the HOLOCAUST itself.

Last but not least, if you think the Khums financial aid and social programmes for the  Sayyeds is not true, and if you have even one single cell of brain in your vacuous cramium, why don't you ask yoruself then what exactly """"Sahme Sadaat"""" part of the Khums means?

And if you still have doubts, since you are from a mullah, sayyed family, I am sure you know that you can write to any of the ayatollahls offices or the howza and ask them any question you want.  Simply ask them what """"Sahme Sadaat"""" portion of the Khums exactly means.

Last but not least, the Persian Art picture that you have uploaded, you have characterized it as """"the artist mixes blah blah with Qajar art""""  ... that is 100% bullshit.

In my own defense: A man has a right to his opinion. I do feel Timothy Usher is a bigot. I do feel that Jews are screwing up the planet (though admittedly Muslims, by far, surpass the Jews in their capacity to destroy things). Look at history. Only recently has it become the norm to like Jews. That only came about after certain countries (eg America) adopted them as the collective dame-in-distress needing shelter and protection. Sort of the precursor to the chihuahua. Before then, Jews were hated in Europe and America alike..And everywhere else. We all know Jews were once banished from most culturally superior European countries. The only reason why Poland took them in was that they had loads of money. Probably the same reason why Washington panders to the now. Point is, alot of people dislike Jews. I'm entitled to, so long as I don't demonstrate that dislike on articles dealing with the topic of Jews. We don't penalize people for not liking things, do we? His Excellency...

 Typically fanatical English nonsense. Just what is wrong with you people? What is it in your culture?

Oh yes, might is right for the British boys when they invade other lands.  Charming. All my grandparents were born under the British boot: not one of them would have described themselves as anything but Irish. In fact, with much justification (see above) they hated the British and their notions about Ireland and the """"proper"""" position of us Irish in our own country. The British, being what they inherently are, sought to keep the Irish people in a subservient position in Ireland. But by the logic of some people- no doubt of the """"British Isles"""" worldview- if the British say we are something, we must in fact be what those people say we are. Yes, you really are never what you really are until the British tell you what you are. What a quintessentially British mentality. Get a grip you shower of obnoxious imperialist arseholes.

You claim that this name was invented by some new comers almost a hundred years ago, this comment alone shows how completely incompetent you are. I have documents that are hundreds of years old that have been passed down through my family over the centuries that specifically speak about the Assyrians and how this name is far more ancient then simple minded people like you claim. This will be the only comment I will make for you because I will not waste my time speaking to a mentally degenerate pig such as yourself who is a denialist, racist, and complete bigot and a distorter of history who denies the race of the Assyrians exist. I will pray every day that you may you die a most horrible death.68.185.65.244

Dear bishonen, here you are again, weren't you forbidden to pollute this talk page anymore by your corupted interventions and arbitrary deleeting and bans?

Your actions, as they have always been, are completely discussfull and under all criticisms.
You are nothing but a little stupid idiot coming and called by ybm as he was ban and not by you! of course, for going again against the 3RR rule, and for having insulted enormously people.
You know of course that people following ybm are called by him and his Voyer """"Idiots""""? or did you forgot? so pay a visit to his website and get a free trip to wake-up land.

All my interventions were absolutly relevant and I am the alone person on this talk page acting like a real admi would!
I came as you certainly didnt read it, with a proposition who was suppose to bring an end to all this mess, but ybm and rjb and your friend snowboard and Maru just made it worse.
I have responded to attacks,and certainly not in the same distorded way who is so familiar to them and to you to express themselves, and your removal of my post is a censorship, a compleete censor of my words who are the truth but who disturb you,
You are the valey of ybm and nothing else and seems to enjoy it.
YBM has called Igor Bogdanov a Bastard twice a short time before you blocked me, you have no rights to do so and your excuse about having warn me a lot before is working a little thin don't you think? i do not have been warned ever ever ever ever by you.
Post warning is no warning.
You should be kicked out from wiki as you are absolutely unable to work as an admi.
This latest action of yours is so discustfull and after you and your boyfreind Geogre alredy did against me this is a Hetz and compleete harassement that you perform only because you know Nicky turnbull to be away for a wild.
You are so disraspectfull of the minimum of ethic and morality, and the minimum of truth and honnesty that I have no business talking with a """"person"""" with such a low standard.
You are completely corrupted and a stain on wikis'reputation.

Shame on you!!

Yeah we all remember that hot chic you hooked up with once 
because you went on to brag about it for months and months. 

Yeah we all get that you think it's impressive 
but ain't nobody impressed with how much you're bench pressing. 
Buying Smirnoff Ice for girls half your age,

you're a douche bag, do-douche bag do-do-do-do-do-douche bag. You're a douche bag, do-douche bag do-do-do-do-do-douche bag. 

Dear Jschnur do you find it necessary to shout into your Bluetooth 
or boast about high school rugby """"and I would have went pro if it weren't for my bum knee"""". 

And why you got to complain every single time your not getting laid. 
You douche bags are a lot of the same. """"Dude let's go. This place is full of grenades"""" Always trying to look cool, like it's a full time career. 
That's why your Facebook pic shows you chugging a beer. 
You got your gold chain and your wife-beater on
So you can fist pump your way to the tanning salon.

Dear Jschnur We all agree that you are a dumb ass. Why can't you see that you're a douche bag, do-douche bag do-do-do-do-do-douche bag. You're a douche bag, do-douche bag do-do-do-do-do-douche bag. 

Inconsiderate, ignorant, you drink you get belligerent, 
you think anybody finds you amusing? No, no, no. Not even a little bit. 
You always find a way to stop all the fun 
like, when you scream """"party foul"""" at the top of your lungs. 
Dear Jschnur, I caught you bragging again. 
Trust me man, nobody gives a damn what frat you were in. 
You claim you hang with celebrities when you don't know any at all.

Hiya. I originally followed this controversy in PC Gamer (my god, back when printed magazines were worth a shit), so off the top of m yhead I didn't have any sites. 

I remember there being a few Geocities webpages on SimCopter, but by the time I had graphical internet (circa 1998) it was already considered an old school game.

One page I found while googling that mentions the controversy is http://www.langston.com/Fun_People/1996/1996CFM.html  another is http://lists.samurai.com/pipermail/bryans-list/1996-December/001811.html  apparently the programmer who inserted this easter egg was fired. Go figure - and here we have people trying to push the view that the Clinton years were all about tolerance. What a load. 

ANYWAY, before I go off on a political tangent, check out those sites, and I'll try to find some actual SimCopter sites at some point (though I get the feeling this will be a fruitless endeavor)",0,0,1,0,0,0

This is ridiculous.
Aside from the reference not actually calling it a war crime, saying that """"some"""" characterize it as one doesn't make it one.
War crimes are serious violations of the laws of war.  The key words here are """"laws"""" and """"war.""""  Unless one lives in a corrupt town, laws are made by legislatures, or in this case ratified by them, after being written and argued over by diplomats in consultation with their military's generals.  The laws of war were written with the understanding that killing large numbers of people may be a legitimate and necessary part of that process.  The laws of war were not written by corrupt and ignorant peaceniks sitting around dreaming up what they think would be moral.

While at Harvard College 19-year-old Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg allegedly used login data from his social network to hack into fellow students email accounts; that evidence also included instant message transcripts where he calls facebook users """"dumb fucks"""". The alleged following exchange is between a 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg and a friend shortly after Mark launched The Facebook in his dorm room:
 
Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard

Zuck: Just ask.

Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS

[Redacted Friend's Name]: What? How'd you manage that one?

Zuck: People just submitted it.

Zuck: I don't know why.

Zuck: They """"trust me""""

Zuck: Dumb fucks.

He was a partisan and a communist, and has fought for Yugoslav union in WW2 and thereafter
Selimović's declaration letter came in 1976, when he was 66, and it came as a result of conflicts and harrasment he had in Sarajevo

You offer rejoinders to my points without ever having addressed them.  Clearly you are unfamiliar with Pope John XXIII, the pontiff who facilitated Vatican II in the early 1960's, and who intentionally refused to refer to the Catholic Church as the """"Roman"""" Catholic Church.  It is equally patently obvious you know nothing about Father McBrien or Charles Whitehead.  Are you incapable of reading above a fifth-grade level, or do you just lack the capacity for intelligent thought?  What's most remarkable is that rather than take solace in your own self-assured beliefs, you repeatedly return to this forum in a juvenile effort to have the last word.  i have one last word for you:  chill.

 Practical proposal for change based on evidence provided above 
Simple to read for assholes who refuse to read:
Proposals:
1) change phrasing in intro
2) do not change focus of the majority of the page on the """"close circle""""
3) perhaps make """"writers"""" section more reader friendly for casual readers with a chart, or something quick and simple to read
4) change naming of """"writers"""" section to something reflected broader scope
5) I would like something like 3 & 4 to be closer to the top, but I do recognize Doom's concern that it weighs down the intro, so we can see for now if it works.

I'm suggesting no change beyond that, but I feel I have provided the beginning of sufficient evidence to support the necessity of this change.

Happily though, others do.

So now you've changed your story of The Hours for the third time, eh? (Or is it fourth? Fifth? I seem to be losing count as you approach the limits of my pitifully deficient arithmetic.) If I, er, comprehend it correctly, the latest draft of The Hours has it that you originally """"thought"""" five hours was """"about"""" two hours. Interesting.  And revealing. In fact you sniffily dismissed the interval as """"less than 2 hours"""" (my emph.). Interesting and revealing because? Because the open-ended """"about"""" tends to support a story of an innocent """"estimate"""".  But """"less than"""" doesn't. """"Less than"""" is specifically limited. Narrowed in focus, specific, it's more clearly a calculated (no pun intended) lie. It's well-known that most liars have trouble remembering which lie they told. Less well-known is the fact that their use of words, trivial though words seem to them, often gives them away. Freudian slips? Elementary, my dear Watson.

precise set of rules, and in this case, a set of rules that demonstrate that
the foundation of the issue is a fraud.  THIS IS NOT OPINION, IT IS FACT, IT
IS RELEVANT TO THE ARTICLE, IT IS FOUNDATIONAL TO THE ARTICLE.  I AM TALKING
ABOUT IMPROVING THE ARTICLE BY CLARIFYING THE FOUNDATION ACCORDING TO THE
RULES OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR AS ANY LITERATE PERSON CAN SEE.  AND I AM TALKING
ABOUT ADDING THE RELEVANT AND FOUNDATIONAL CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSE.

FROM TALK GUIDELINES (why don't you review them!):

 There is reasonable allowance for speculation, suggestion, and personal
knowledge on talk pages, with a view to prompting further investigation.

 make the extra effort so that other people understand you. Being
friendly is a great help.

 It is always a good idea to explain your views; it is less helpful for you to
voice an opinion on something and not explain why you hold it.

 Article talk pages should be used to discuss ways to improve an article;

 Deal with facts

 The talk page can be used to """"park"""" material removed from the article due to
verification or other concerns, while references are sought or concerns
discussed.

 The talk page is particularly useful to talk about edits.

 New proposals for the article can be put forward for discussion
by other editors if you wish.

 Do not threaten people: For example, ...
having them banned for disagreeing with you.

 removing others' comments is sometimes allowed.
But you should ... stop if there is any objection.

As I previously posted here: THE ARTICLE SHOULD BE IMPROVED by making it clear
in the opening statement that the entire issue is a fraud upon the public
since there is no """"natural born citizen"""" requirement that is applicable today.
That is fundamental to an informative relevant foundation to the article, not
a matter of opinion, and a matter of grammatical fact.

If I say """"No animal except a mouse, or a rat, at the time I give the signal,
shall be captured"""", then I am saying only mice and rats shall be captured AT
THE TIME I GIVE THE SIGNAL.  My order has no validity at any other point in
time.  Similarly, the requirement for """"natural born citizen"""" only applied AT
THE TIME OF THE ADOPTION OF THIS CONSTITUTION.  It does not apply today, and
the following clause should be part of the article, since it is the clause at
the foundation of the issue in the article:

No person except a natural born Citizen, or a
Citizen of the United States, at the time of the
Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible
to the Office of President; neither shall any
person be eligible to that Office who shall not
have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and
been fourteen Years a Resident within the United
States.

THIS IS MY REPLY TO YOU THAT YOU HAVE DELETED ACTING AS A FASCIST FROM THE DISCUSSION ON NICOSIA PAGE:

Nicosia and discrimination against Greek contributors and the Greek character of the cityDear Salvio,

You have accused me of abusive behaviour against other users and consequently blocked me from editing the article on Nicosia for a 24 hour period.

May I draw to your attention that it is fairly obvious that those three users namely Seb az86556 , Seric2 and Chesdovi are clearly constantly creating a picture of Nicosia as a decadent muslim city that serves their religious beliefs and are all clearly hailing form Turkish backgrounds.

There is a constant undermining of the city´s Greek identity i.e. whenever a Greek flag appears in any single picture the aforementioned users delete that picture instantaneously and prefer to throw in pictures of the flag of """"shame"""" and occupation that is equivalent to a legalisation of a human crime of continuous brutal occupation of the island of Cyprus by the Turkish army.

The Greek flag is OMNIPRESENT in the Republic of Cyprus whether some people like it or detest it but this is the reality and an Encyclopedia that wishes to be UNBIASED should depict the REALITY and not the subjective views of a minority of readers that are furthermore based on extremist religious and nationalistic views. On the other hand, such users do find it appropriate to throw in pictures using the Turkish and the ILLEGAL, yes illegal according to United Nation referendums flat of the non-recognised internationally illegal self-proclaimed state of the so-called TRNC.

It is totally UNACCEPTABLE to have extremist nationalistic individuals, that strategically reached the level of administrators, deteriorating all the time the article on the city of Nicosia, promoting an unrealistic Turkish character and undermining the Greek character of the city AND at the same time having an ADDITIONAL article on """"North Nicosia"""" that is depicting a totally FALSE picture w.r.t the city. The TRNC is illegal, not recognised by any state other than Turkey and some terrorist states that are non-democratic and yet Wikipedia has a page on Northern Nicosia by supposedly administrators that support the unification of Cyprus. This is clearly a major distortion of their intentions and a huge lie in that an individual that pretends to be a neutral aribtrator and a supoporter of reunification cannot have a separate page on Northern Nicosia stressing how Turkish it is and then go and literally destroy everything in the proper page for Nicosia and emphasize the Turkish character of the city, talk about the tension and the division of the city all the time and undermine the Greek character.

This is clear nationalistic and racial discrimination against the indisputable Greek character of the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus and furthermore it is downgrading for the Republic of Cyprus the mere fact that Wikipedia has a site that is CONSTANTLY vandalised by several ethnic Turkish extremists and Wikipedia users support such discriminatory behaviour.

In the light of all of this, I shall stop contributing to Wikipedia as I consider it downgrading for my own self. Furthermore, I do not wish to participate in an """"encyclopedic"""" project that is totally biased and discriminatory.

See.  There's the problem. As a non-admin, I am liable to be blackballed by admins, some of whom suffer from Projection (or do they merely think sophistry is administration?):

I performed no personal attacks.  I made analogies between admin behavior and classical abuse of power.
I was personally attacked. No admins have been blocked.

I was not trolling.  Calling me a troll is nothing but a lie designed to anger me and cause me to overreact.  It's an attempt to fabricate """"evidence"""" for a block.
At least one admin thinks my being called a troll is enough evidence, because now I am blocked. (And I seriously doubt any admin is reading this page).

I was not disrupting anything and I am not posting in any inappropriate manner.  I was discussing the problem in the forum provided.  Blocking people to stop them from winning an argument is the disruption.

There are 1,7000 admins on this thing.  I have no illusion that all 1,700 of them will be right all the time.  The first 20 who saw Chooserr's postings may have said """"okay by me"""".  It's the first one who comes along who misreads the situation who causes the problem.  One mistaken admin invalidates the opinions of 20 rational ones.  Meanwhile, a well-meaning user is punished for doing nothing wrong, demonized in the community, and the community is thrown into dysfunction.  To the point that anyone coming to their defense is treated with an egregious level of imperiousness, intimidation, sophistry, and dismissive attitude, followed by an abuse of power.

Do not block me.  Block Curps for failing to perform due diligence before injuring a user.  Block Zoe and Mysekurity for validating and amplifying Curps' error rather than taking a skeptical attitude.  Block Nandesuka for repeating the error and then attacking me for defending the oppressed individual.  And block Sean Black for either deliberately or gormlessly falling for their false accusations against me.

Wikipedia is a commercial traffic engine. As of December 2008, there are over 14,700 external links from Wikipedia to Wales' Wikia.com sites, which are funded by Google AdSense revenues. Did you know that Amazon invested $10,000,000 in the for-profit Wikia venture? It's therefore rather interesting that there are over 43,000 links to Amazon's retail site from the supposedly non-profit Wikipedia site. Isn't it? Meanwhile, did you know that the popular movie site IMDB.com is owned by Amazon, and you can buy Amazon products directly from IMDB pages? Well, surprise surprise  there are nearly 174,000 links to Amazon's IMDB site from Wikipedia. No wonder Amazon particularly wished to invest in Wikia, Inc. Its co-founder makes sure that the external linking environment on Wikipedia is hospitable for the Amazon link spamming machine! 

Now here is the really fascinating thing. If you go to Jimmy Wales' """"talk page"""" on Wikipedia, and you ask him whether he feels that this obscene number of links to his for-profit site and those of his investors might be a conflict of interest or self-dealing, Jimbo won't even have time to respond. One or two of his sycophants will fairly promptly dismiss or erase your message; and if you try one more time to ask this question, you're likely to get blocked from editing Wikipedia altogether. Go ahead, try it

Reply to vandal Wakkeenah
To all the vandals and so called just administrators, the air dates are minor problems, the facts and details surrounding Reeves suicided are not being written well enough, as everybody else is reporting, the fact that Reeves was to fight Moore next day, is also being reverted, this is pure vandalism. As far as spelling goes by Vesa or Projects or whoever, well, if you keep on repeating yourself and have no time, some spelling errors might occur, but it's not the spelling that counts but content which is being vandalised by so called just users and administrators of this so called just wikipedia. And it is obvious wahkeenah has some personal interest in this, proof: All over internet we have Reeves' death explained in detail and possible people involved, but over here he is taking everything down, the idiotic administratotors are reversing it, thus making themselves look stupid and ignorant by not realizing the historical facts.""",1,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Ben! You've recently uploaded and added to articles some images of covers of TVTimes magazine. You've correctly tagged them as fair-use/magazine, but I don't think the images are being used under fair-use considerations.

The tag for fair-use/magazines says:

...It is believed that the use of low-resolution images of magazine covers: to illustrate the publication of the issue of the magazine in question,...

The images are being used to illustrate programmes, not the TVTimes magazine. Therefore I'd say they're not being fairly used under the terms of Wikipedia's fair-use copyrights policy.

Additionally, the tag says ...To the uploader: please add a detailed fair use rationale for each use, as described on Wikipedia:Image description page, as well as the source of the work and copyright information. These images do not have a fair use rationale on the image page and they don't provide the source of the work (scan, taken from another website etc).

I suspect that the images will need to be removed from the articles you've put them in, but I'd be interested in hearing your views. Thanks ➨ ❝REDVERS❞

just because we didnt assimilated these people, we are accused of this things.
we should have colonized all of them just like britons and the french. ohh algeria didnt deserve its independence, right?

all of armenians, greeks, assyrians, jews, turks, kurds whatever, they all lived peacefully for thousands of year, and they still live. if any of these people try to split the country which some of them did in the past. they paid this with their life.. dont think turks didnt affected by this. those of you still think there is genocides by turks to other minorities have to read memoirs by armenian grandmothers, greeks grandfathers living in turkey... i bet you'll find interesting things.",1,0,0,0,0,0

Wuhwuzdat and Hellbus. When's the wedding. Now don't expect me to come, but don't worry, i'll watch you on the news, on the next 9/11, ha ha ha ha haaaaaaa. This time it will be a nuclear event. You can count on that. Wuhwuzdat, can you feel me near. Do you sent the jet fuel stench. Tell me, how is it feel when someone like me is taking a dump in your mouth, and there's nothing you can do against. Oh, not against me  87.252.167.254. The real Me. Well, what can you expect from a """"nation' with a Nigg. president, a Kenyan nigg. Impotent nation. Though i must admit, that whore Michelle is ouch sexy. But don't you even think about woman like that. First you gotta pass the jerk off period in your life, before you start eyeballing women. Well, good luck to you Abomination [Obama Nation]. By the way, if you wondering what's going on with Osama Bin Laden (Osama/Obama, pretty close names, don't you think), i'll let you know. He's hiding.

d0f292817862c8e2,"Thanks for blocking me. I called Tao an idiot and a dumb bastard because I truly belive he/she is one. You have these rules to prevent harassment. Fine. I was just doing it for fun, got it out of my system, I'll quit now. However, you should seriously consider a NDB&LP; rule, or No Dumb Bastards and Lazy People. Wikipedia is currently a laughing stock, a punchline to a joke. The reason is that it facilitates lazy people like Tao. If you read the entire entry, my intention is to improve the page. I provide sources, I provide a sound argument, I provide what's necessary to provide in circumstances like this in order to improve the page. What does Tao provide? Nothing. He clearly has not read the page, he clearly does not know the subject, and he clearly is uninterested in doing what needs to be done in circumstances like this: making valid claims supported with evidence. True, I don't take Wikipedia seriously, but I believe in its potential. I wouldn't do anything that I believe harms it in a substantial way. Tao, on the other hand, is an insidious virus who does little but undermine the value of Wikipedia. In a just world, he would be the one being blocked. This is not a genuine appeal against being blocked because I'm the one who asked for it. This is an appeal for you to actually read the conversation, read my swear-filled diatribe as me antagonizing someone who is genuinely very, very, very lazy in what he is doing (how long did it take to get me blocked after I even begged and taunted?)  please tell me, of the two of us who really should be blocked?
