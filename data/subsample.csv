 Well, I see """"Eep"""" has put this utter insanity back on the Sitchin page. Que lastima. Well, I'm afraid this experience is leading me away from Wikipedia. I just found it, and have been enjoying it all week, reading this and that page. But now that I know that people with no rational capacity are putting up whatever 'causes a stir' on the Internet and treating painfully obvious hoaxes like meaningful information worthy of an Encyclopedia, I just don't feel I can trust this website. It's a shame because it's a really great idea, but how can you stop folks like Eep from screwing the whole thing up? Then again . . . maybe the problem is the nature of this particular page  Zechariah Sitchin  and his type of follower. Perhaps I will not run into this kind of thing on a page not related to conspiracy theory? Anyway, Eep, I'm sure you mean well, but you are muddying the waters for the rest of us.

Now here's some PHILOSOPHY (it seems there's no alternative User:Quiddity but to shout it:
   """"The history of philosophy is punctuated
   by revolts against the practices of previous
   philosophers and by attempts to transform 
   philosophy into a science—a discipline in 
   which universally recognized decision-
   procedures are available for testing phil-
   osophical theses.  In Descartes, in Kant, in
   Hegel, in Husserl, in Wittgenstein’s Trac-
   tatus, and again in Wittgenstein’s Phil-
   osophical Investigations, one finds the same
   disgust at the spectacle of philosophers 
   quarreling endlessly over the same issues.  
   The proposed remedy for this situation 
   typically consists in adopting a new 
   method: for example, the method of  “clear
   and distinct ideas” outlined in Descartes’
   Regulae, Kant’s “transcendental method,”
   Husserl’s “bracketing,” the early Wittgen-
   stein’s attempt to exhibit the meaningless-
   ness of traditional philosophical theses by 
   due attention to logical form, and the later
   Wittgenstein’s attempt to exhibit the point-
   lessness of these theses by diagnosing the 
   causes of their having being propounded.  
   In all of these revolts, the aim of the revo-
   lutionary is to replace opinion with knowl-
   edge, and to propose as the proper mean-
   ing of “philosophy” the accomplishment 
   of some finite task by applying a certain set
   of mythological directions.

insidiousness n.

[Latin insidiosus ‘cunning’ from insidiae ‘ambush’ (as in-2, sedere ‘sit’)]

Perhaps it should be mentioned that the in- morpheme that prefixes the word insidious, is peripheral in meaningfulness, and that the """"sidious"""" element has its root in LAtin insidiae ‘ambush’.

Dog breeding is artificial selection by deliberate human action, and works by increasing the frequencies of the desired alleles in the breeding group and / or by eliminating undesired alleles (but dog breeders don't think in terms of genes, only of desirable / undesirable traits). Hope that helps.
Re """"mutations' sound to the layman rather dramatic ..."""", that's a fair point, which the article should clear up. Generally the more dramatic mutations will be unviable and, in placentals mammals including humans, will usually be spontaneously aborted (can't remember the incidence of this in humans but it's surprisingly high; most mothers are unaware of it because such embryos usually abort before symptoms of pregnancy appear). Viable mutations are rare and small, which is why evolution is so slow by human standards.

Please reverse this merger. The simplest and most important reason is that aside from it's function as a thyroid hormone thyroxine is simply a chemical compound that should have its own article. For instance, go look at the triiodothyronine page and you'll see the standard chemical description page there with molecular weight, chemical formula, IUPAC name, etc. - a wealth of information uninteresting to and therefore absent from the thyroid hormone page this link now redirects to. The original thyroxine page should be restored with all of this chemical information. Regarding some of the above discussion - it is true that thyroxine produced in the thyroid can be either enantiomer and that the isolated levo-thyroxine enantiomer is what is in the drug. This is specifically interesting because levothyroxine can only be converted to """"normal"""" T3, not """"reverse"""" T3 - which is the other enantiomer. This has physiological consequences for those on the drug. So I think this is good information that we should add to the Thyroxine page once it is restored - but I don't think a separate page is needed for that. We just need the separate Thyroxine page back to have a place for that information to go - along with all of the now absent chemical information since merger with the Thyroid Hormones article. How do we/who can reverse this? Thanks...206.112.75.195  mjd

Notice
This article focuses on the military campaign, while the American Revolution covers the origins of the war, as well as other social and political issues.

Please try to keep this article at a reasonable length. The current approach has been to summarize the war in a way that will be clearly understandable to the general reader, without cluttering it up with too many details. Concentrate on the major figures and actions, and try to leave detailed discussion of war strategies, battle casualties, historical debates, etc. to linked articles about specific battles or actions.

Instead of adding additional detail to this lengthy article, consider adding your information to an article on a specific battle, or to one of these campaign articles currently in development. Additionally, one campaign, Northern theater of the American Revolutionary War after Saratoga (box at right), does not yet have an article specifically about those operations. Perhaps you will start it Miguel!

NPOV

Reading this article it looks like the US won the war solo, with some assistance (which was mostly inept) from some other countries, one of which happened to be France.  This is evident in the introduction and throughout the article.  The introduction is particularly blatant, mentioning non-American intervention only as an after thought.  Should the WWI and WWII articles mention American intervention as an afterthought too? Am I the only one to think this is a problem?   

I have edited the intro so that it is less laughable.    
I agree especially Yorktown   

Casualties
I think that the casualty figures in this article are incorrect, as 25,000 Americans died in all, and 24,000 British and their allies.

Hello user at address 90.184.243.14,

Hmmm... I don’t really agree with your comments.  I guess the disagreement boils down to what we think that Wikipedia stands for.

I was under the impression that one of the aims of Wikipedia was that it allowed information to be distributed freely worldwide and not to be controlled by commercialist corporations.  You clearly disagree with this perception.  

I take your point that the H-K adsorption isotherm isn't as popular as Langmuir & BET but the equation is peer reviewed and used by a number of research groups.  Taking the info off the adsorption website would consign this peer reviewed equation to books and journals that people would have to pay to access.  

I see this action as being very much against the Wikipedia ethos and think that the text should be reinstated immediately.

Moreover, if possible I think that people should be encouraged to add other “lower status” equations to the webpage so that as much information as possible is disseminated free of charge.    

Regarding the text being written in a journal style format: does it really matter as long as it communicates the workings of the equation?",0,0,0,0,0,0

As somewhat of an aside perhaps, don't get me wrong...I fully support the axiom that an immigrant to a Jewish community should become a part of that community, adopting its minhagim as his own.

 Yep.  This is one of several cases where the vast majority of the time the pattern is met, it is indeed vandalism.  (I suspect something like 99% or better, but have no actual data behind that, so it's really just a guestimate.)  There are a small number of cases on this and some other of the bot's criteria that are actually false positives.  The error matches a vandalistic pattern, but is actually not vandalism.  In general it has been decided that this is a small enough price to pay for the good that the bot does in rapidly reverting the rest that are indeed vandalism.  In general the bot is supposed to run in Friendly mode, where it will not edit war.  This means that if you get hit by a false positive, just make the edit again and remove the warning from your talk page.  The bot should not revert a second time on the same edit.
 As for refining, that's tricky.  What was there about those two edits that a bot, a computer program, could have used to identify them as not vandalism?  Sure, the bot could be programmed with the very specific examples of those two edits, but the next time won't be exactly the same.  If we told it that """"CITATION NEEDED"""" was not vandalism, then the next time they used """"NEED CITATION"""", or """"CITATION REQUIRED"""" or """"FACT CHECK"""", then the bot would not catch it.  We cannot anticipate every single way someone might make this mistake.  The radio station edit is even more tricky.  And what about the edits that have nothing to do with citations or radio stations?  We would need solid criteria that would allow the bot to tell that one all-cap edit is vandalism while another is not.  And I for one have no idea what we could use.  New ideas for improving the bot are welcome, but in this case we need very specific ideas for rules that will help a bot tell the difference.  The bot is stupid, and only does what it is programmed to do, nothing more.  It cannot make judgement calls edit by edit. -  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

  Lebanon: Catholic Villagers attack and vandalize Baptist Church
Posted on 29 August, 2006

 Maronite Catholics attacked a newly-built, independent Baptist church near Beirut this month, mauling churchgoers preparing to host war refugees from southern Lebanon. 

The violence flared up after of several weeks of tense public debate between Maronite and Baptist clergy. More than 20 men from Ajaltoun village attacked Christ Bible Baptist Church on August 2, slashing car tires, breaking the church door and windows, stealing computer and sound equipment, beating men and groping several women. 

Compass Direct, Aug 22, 2006 

A group of 10 Maronite men assaulted Baptist Pastor Raymond Abou-Mekhael and another church member at 6:30 p.m. as they were on their way to retrieve items from their parked cars. The Maronites broke the unidentified church member’s rib and both men’s glasses, smashed the car windows and then dumped the two men inside before joining another group of 10 in attacking the church building. 

“Police were at the church watching everything,” Abou-Mekhael, 35, told Compass. “They even advised the attackers on what to steal and vandalize.” 

Abou-Mekhael said that the men were led by Ajaltoun Mayor Khalil Tabet, who had the church officially sealed off with “red wax” immediately after the attack so that no one could enter the building. 

In an August 6 newspaper article entitled, “No Justification for Building a Baptist Church in a Region whose Overwhelming Majority is Maronite,” the local Maronite bishop attacked the Baptist church’s right to exist. 

Bishop Guy-Paul Noujaim wrote in local newspapers that there were “no followers of the Baptists in Ajaltoun,” and the “decrees of the Middle East Council of Churches [to which the church does not belong] prohibit building a church in areas without followers therein.” 

In an e-mail to Compass, Bishop Noujaim said that the Baptist congregation had requested a permit to build a residence but had instead built a church. He declined to answer questions about whether he had been aware of plans to attack the church on August 2, but said that he had been celebrating mass at a church in the mountains when he received a telephone call alerting him to the violence. 

In articles published in Addiyar and Annahar newspapers, the bishop called for the attorney general to close down the building. 

“This is nonsense,” said Salim Sahyouni, President of the High Council of Evangelical Churches in Syria and Lebanon, to which the Ajaltoun Baptist church belongs. “We can worship in a legal church building, we can worship in an apartment and we can worship in the free air.” 

As a Protestant community in Lebanon, “we have the full rights to build churches to worship freely in any place we choose,” Sahyouni told Compass. “We do not need to get permission.” 

Worship Rights 

In his written responses to Compass, Bishop Noujaim did not specify why it was illegal to hold church services in a home but claimed that the Baptists were violating the law by owning a printing press in the basement of their building. 

The bishop’s biggest complaint was that the Baptists aimed to steal Maronite members of his flock. 

“Why don’t the Baptists want to be part of the Middle East Council of Churches?” the bishop wrote, referring to an ecumenical council of Orthodox, Catholic and certain Protestant churches that he said forbids proselytizing each other’s members. “Don’t they support ecumenism and dialogue? If we are mistrustful of the Baptist people, it is because of their bad behavior.” 

The bishop did not respond to questions about whether individuals in Ajaltoun had the",0,0,0,0,0,0

This has been done because the article appears to be about a real person, organization (band, club, company, etc.), or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. If this is the first page that you have created, then you should read the guide to writing your first article.

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

In contrast, if we were to discuss the policy of the AMA, the reader wouldn't have any information at all about other policies.  Also, it might come across as rather US-centric.

What was done on these two pages is a bit different from the pages I'm used to seeing.  Most of the pages I've looked at place a  tag in a section named References, and populate that section with inline REF_ITEM instances, where REF_ITEM is often formatted by one of the citation templates from WP:CITET.  Individual REF_ITEMs in the text hook to their References section appearances via numbered links and backlinks supplied by the mechanism behind the , , and  tags (the Cite.php extension to MediaWiki) .  The {{ref}} & {{note}} template family can also be used to supply connective links and backlinks, but don't do auto-numbering of links.

WP:GTL describes the References section as containing """"... [items] that you used in constructing the article and have referenced (cited) in the article. An example is then given using , which puts the example item into a  collection under an example section named (confusingly, to me) Notes instead of References.

What appears to have been done on the two pages being discussed here is that the items which would go in the References section have been broken up into (1) some harvard-referenced books and (2) other stuff  mostly web pages but some books as well on the Committee for Skeptical Inquiry page , with the harvard-referenced books being put in a bulleted list in a section titled References and the other stuff in a list auto-numbered with  etc. in a section named Notes.

 """"The term """"Arabic numerals"""" is actually a misnomer""""
 This smacks of political revisionism of the worst kind; what is known in English as the Arabic Numerals are the Arabic Western Numerals, not even the Arabic Eastern Numerals. Yes, they are derived from ancient Indian numerals but nonetheless they are the Arabic Numerals. Look here, the norm is that when people in English say Arabic Numerals they are referring to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, those are the Arabic (Western) Numerals, they are not referring to १, २, ३, ४, ५, ६, ७, ८, ९, and other varities of Indian numerals, modern or ancient. They are known in English as the Arabic Numerals, that's a fact, I will not accept a revisionist statement that counters a fact so early on in the text the article, the article must start with the factual. I'll accept it under a revisionism section much later on, but it must be balanced there with opinions counter to it (counter to the counterfactual). 

 """"... what are known in English as """"Arabic numerals"""" were neither invented nor widely used by the Arabs."""", """"In the Arab World—until modern times—the Arabic numeral system was used only by mathematicians. Muslim scientists used the Babylonian numeral system, and merchants used a numeral system similar to the Greek numeral system and the Hebrew numeral system. Therefore, it was not until Fibonacci that the Arabic numeral system was used by a large population.""""
 What reliable sources do you have that they were not widely used by the Arabs? Why don't you cite reliable sources? Here's evidence that they were  The numerals though were already in wide use throughout the Arab empire, as Avicenna who was born in 980 tells in his autobiography that he learnt them, as a child, from a humble vegetable seller. He also tells that when his father, in Bukhara, was visited by scholars from Egypt in 997, including Abu Abdullah al-Natili, they taught him more about them. J J O'Connor and E F Robertson point out: He also tells of being taught Indian calculation and algebra by a seller of vegetables. All this shows that by the beginning of the eleventh century calculation with the Indian symbols was fairly widespread and, quite significantly, was known to a vegetable trader.

 """"The first inscriptions using 0 in India have been traced to approximately 200 CE.""""
 Why don't you cite reliable sources?! Here, I'll cite some: According to Professor EF Robertson and DR JJ O'Connor, """"The first record of the Indian use of zero which is dated and agreed by all to be genuine was written in 876"""" on the Gwalior tablet stone. This is also verified by Professor Lam Lay Yong, an an Effective Member of the International Academy of the History of Science """"the earliest appearance in India of a symbol for zero in the Hindu-Arabic numeral system is found in an inscription at Gwalior which is dated 870 AD"""". According to Menninger (p. 400): """"This long journey begins with the Indian inscription which contains the earliest true zero known thus far (Fig. 226). This famous text, inscribed on the wall of a small temple in the vicinity of Gvalior (near Lashkar in Central India) first gives the date 933 (A.D. 870 in our reckoning) in words and in Brahmi numerals. Then it goes on to list four gifts to a temple, including a tract of land """"270 royal hastas long and 187 wide, for a flower-garden."""" Here, in the number 270 the zero first appears as a small circle (fourth line in the Figure); in the twentieth line of the inscription it appears once more in the expression """"50 wreaths of flowers"""" which the gardeners promise to give in perpetuity to honor the divinity."""" The Encyclopaedia Britannica says, """"Hindu literature gives evidence that the zero may have been known before the birth of Christ, but no inscription has been found with such a symbol before the 9th century."""" I'll accept mention prior to the Gwalior tablet, in fact, the article needs it and I'm planning on doing it once I'm no longer distracted by your nonsense, but such mention must be well-phrased so as not to mislead and contradict scientific consensus, and the phrasing must be limited to the exact intent of verifiable and reliable sources.

Please tell me does wikipedia allow ADMINS to hold a biased one sided opinion? When SIKH HISTORY admin have openly declared adherence to a strict orthodox viewpoint, you as MOD should really be enforcing wikipedias own rules on your own admin. You unblocking me is secondry to the blatent disregard for wikipedia rules on diet in sikhism. So its NOT MY truth that i hold, its wikikpedia rules that i hold, which YOU disregard. Now you have barred me, because you deem me argument on integrity an attack on ADMIN, when i have repeated over and over again, its an ISSUE of an article which is purely one sided. Now does wikipedia allow blatant disregard of rules from their own ADMIN? 

From the same scholar, same book, same ISBN NUMBER, one rejected and one accepted, the accepted statement fits in with the ADMINS own orthodox stance which he has openly declared on his Wikipedia page. 

1.QUOTE FROM ARTICLE - Gobind Singh Mansukhani states how vegetarianism and meat-eating has been left to the individual Sikh. 2.QUOTE FROM DELETED PASSAGE -scholars hold a view that Sikhism has an ambivalent view on diet, yet some accept that there are, 

“passages against meat eating”. REF for both 1 and 2. Gobind Singh Mansukhani, Introduction to Sikhism, Delhi: Hemkunt Press, ISBN 81-7010-181-6, “There are passages against meat, in the Adi Granth”. Both references from the SAME scholar, yet one is accepted which is favor of an ambivalent view towards diet, while another assessment from the same scholar admitting their are passages against meat eating, is not accepted. Why the Double standards? 

Why does the ADMIN on sikhhistory, blatantly support their own ideological stance, to the point of synthesis, and selectively using texts and passages, from authors who they cite, and then reject the same authors when going against their position? 

How can you adressing harassment, yet make no attempt on addressing the issue of BIAS in your articles? Do you only protect the Orthodox Sunni islamic view? and the unorthodox shia view?...IF that is not the case, then please can you tell me why sikhhistory ADMIN have taken the biased stance of only abiding by an orthodox POV.

I dont think these questions im asking is harassment, but if my objection is avoided time and again, and the same allegations being made towards the same ADMIN for being one sided, you again have AVOIDED the issue at hand, which is a biased article protected by ADMIN to support their own beleifs, i think that is a greater offense than my trying to get some sense from the ADMIN in question. lol.",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi there! I'd like to invite you to explore Wikimedia Canada, and create a list of people interested in forming a local chapter for our nation.

Strelchick
  I got your message about Strelchick.  When I made an article about him, it was about 2 weeks before the election.  It was only 2 sentences long.  Then some NDP-er added like 100 paragraphs too it.  (Don't worry, Im a staunch liberal)  I think it should be shortnened, and then, if nothing at all happens for about six months, deleted.  But not yet.  Thanks.

 Help with Vandalism 

Hey, you seem like a fairly experienced user, so I thought I'd ask you for help.

Strelchick redux

While it's clear that the new editors' behaviour is inappropriate, I'd be remiss if I didn't also suggest to you that you might want to be a bit more careful in the future not to get involved in discussions where you might be perceived as having a personal bias. Whether you do or don't isn't even really the point — sometimes all that's necessary to spark this kind of ruckus is the perception that you have a vested interest. They obviously believe that your nomination was politically motivated rather than based on a neutral assessment of Wikipedia policy.

In future, it might be best to just avoid putting yourself in a situation where your motivations might be questioned in this way. You can always ask other editors, or the Canadian notice board, to review a situation if you think your motivations for proposing a course of action might be questioned.

 etymology 

The family consists of the genus Aplodactylus. The name means either """"single finger"""" or """"simple finger"""" (Greek haploos / aploe + daktylos). [Sourced to Fishbase, depending on whether you look at Aplodactylidae or Aplodactylus-punctatus]
Is anybody able to look at Cuvier and Valenciennes, 1832? This is supposed to be the original source of the genus name, and conceivably gives some insight as to where the name was meant to come from. (Primary sources aren't ideal, but a self-contradictory secondary source isn't better.) Presumably there is some defining and identifying property of the fish's fin, which not only gives it the name but would more broadly also be worth mentioning in the article.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Enter Batwoman
This character made her debut in Detective Comics #233 (July 1956), written by Edmond Hamilton and illustrated by Sheldon Moldoff. It seems clear that her introduction was part of a publishing decision to alter the ambiance of the series. Memories are vague on this point, but the responsibility may have rested with DC publisher Harry Donenfeld's son Irwin. After Whitney Ellsworth moved to California to produce a Superman television series, Irwin Donenfeld was serving as de facto editor in chief. """"He came in and he had a lot of things that he sort of threw at us,"""" recalled Batman editor Jack Schiff.

 Sources, offers, and 1975 Iraqi government ads in Toronto Star, New York Times, and Le Monde 

It should be mentioned how different Arab governments have said they would allow former Jewish citizens of their nations to return and live in the Arab world (Morocco, Egypt, Yemen, Iraq, etc). Putting aside if one considers this a credible offer or possible. The clearest example of this (again putting aside what one thinks of it) was again by the Iraqi government on December 11, 1975 putting full page advertisements in numerous Western newspapers (The New York Times, Toronto Star, and Le Monde) asking any Iraqi Jews who left Iraq to feel free to return to Iraq (again putting aside whether one views this as a genuine offer or not). This page is sourced  and is done by someone with a Ph. D.  Also the reality of the existence of in particular the Iraqi government advertisements of December 11, 1975 (calling for any Iraqi Jews to come back to Iraq) is admitted even by ideologically Zionist website [www.eretzyisroel.org/~jkatz/discredit.html] which state that pro-Zionist groups """"scoffed at"""" the Iraqi offer. 

This info should be included and the sources are valid (written by a Ph. D.), especially if writings of the """"JCPA"""" is included as the JCPA is an obviously partisan think-tank associated with the Israeli Likud party in particular (so any noting of the legitimate sources I'm providing, putting aside the pro-Zionist source corroborating in particular the 1975 Iraqi government advertisements, being partisan to one side should also then have the """"JCPA"""" links and writings removed for partisan reasons). This info should be included in the """"compensation"""" section as it by itself (the offer, whether one believes it or things like it are genuine or not) would be an offer of not just """"compensation"""" but a return to where one originally came from in the first place. Putting aside that one of the most thorough discussions of the whole issue has been done by Professor Shenhav.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I wish I could find better sites to post, but those two are the only ones I've been able to locate. I did not mean to post a commercial site, and did not think I was posting a commercial site, since none of the sites I posted actually sold any poppers. In rereading your posts, heah, I noted that you thought the sites were commercials for poppers. I would agree that some might consider the second one as such, but the allaboutpoppers.com site is not. If you actually read it, which takes a while due to the huge amount of content, you'll find it's not commercial.

I believe HC is a talented writer and artist.  His work is an important and significant criticism of modern culture, web culture, and the human mind. His prose is original and he provides unique, sardonic, insight.  Unfortunately, his work is very obscure and he has remained entirely anonymous. I feel certain that there are multiple independent sources that would verify the notability of HC; though I am having trouble finding them. Here is what I have found:

From Impermenent Press: (not independant, but I believe the quotes can be considered independent.

And, if you read the Mau abstract, there does seem to be evidence for the gene, they've narrowed down the probable location of the gene.  What is not known is if it has linkage to Sabino, and sabino may be caused by a number of different genes, of which only SB1 has been mapped:  """"So far, it is not known whether dominant white (W) and sabino spotting (S) share a common genetic background. In this study, a pedigree consisting of 87 horses segregating for dominant white (W) was used to genetically localize the horse (W)-locus. Microsatellite ASB23 was found linked to (W), which allowed us to map dominant white to a region on horse chromosome 3q22.""""

The Cherokee comment was a concern because JVM stated, as if it were established fact, that the person he was talking about had attempted witness tampering, extortion, and solicitation of murder.  That's libel if it's not true.  Yet the claim doesn't square with the fact that the person was never charged on such grounds, and the drug charges were eventually dismissed.  I don't think murder-for-hire, extortion, or witness tampering would be treated so lightly by federal and state prosecutors; in one sentence JVM claims that the plot was uncovered during the trial and just a couple of diffs later he claims that he was involved in arranging a deal resulting in only a permanent injunction against selling peyote.  Can you blame me if I find this farfetched?  Aren't such falsehoods disruptive to WP?

Your comment that his edits related to LDS articles are """"no more POV than the average LDS editor's contributions"""" is mind-boggling to me.  Your opinion of LDS people must be very poor indeed if that's the case, and it makes me wonder if I'm not swimming upstream here in trying to raise concerns about JVM.  Do you mistrust my motives because I'm LDS?  Would you be as forgiving of JVM's behavior if he were creating articles on """"Anglican teachings about extraterrestrial life"""" or """"Orthodox Jew men in black""""?  I've approached you with my concerns because you're just ze guy who unblocked JVM, you know?  But now it seems like you're inclined to assume bad faith on my part, on little more basis than my religion, and granting JVM the benefit of the doubt despite his lengthy history of bad behavior, threats, disruption, and fanciful claims.  I'm absolutely confident your motives are unimpeachable, but do you think you've been consistent in your approach to our conflict?  Maybe you think I'm out to troll JVM or something... is that it?

 National Archives ExtravaSCANza 
You are invited to the National Archives ExtravaSCANza, taking place every day next week from January 4–7, Wednesday to Saturday, in College Park, Maryland (Washington, DC metro area). Come help me cap off my stint as Wikipedian in Residence at the National Archives with one last success!

This will be a casual working event in which Wikipedians are getting together to scan interesting documents at the National Archives related to a different theme each day—currently: spaceflight, women's suffrage, Chile, and battleships—for use on Wikipedia/Wikimedia Commons. The event is being held on multiple days, and in the evenings and weekend, so that as many locals and out-of-towners from nearby regions1 as possible can come. Please join us! ·t

 FBI found Miley's hacker 

Some of the controversial photos on the internet (not the Vanity Fair photos) of Cyrus exposing some parts of her body were apparently posted by somebody who hacked one of her former e-mail accounts.  The FBI raided his house.  Here is one article, and there are others out there in case it is not reliable enough (although I think it is reliable): http://tech.yahoo.com/news/nm/20081022/wr_nm/us_cyrus_tech_1

Playboy offer
I was wondering whether this is really relevant: """"In May 2008, Hugh Hefner made news when he offered a magazine pictorial to 15 year old Miley. Hefner said she was a """"pretty lady"""" but would have to wait until she was 18 to appear in the magazine."""". This honestly soudns more of an advertisement for Playboy on the biggest teen pop star's MySpace than something genuine?  

I'd take it out. Miley possibly gets a lot of offers for many things that don't warrant inclusion here within her article.  \talk 
Well, i feel that in light of her backless photo controversy, Hefner offer might be included. But i feel it doesnt require a separate section to mention it. It might be merged in the photo controversy section.

 Josephine Baker 

I'd like to ask that you review the talk portion of the sexuality section on Josephine Baker's page. My discussion went off on a tangent with Malik Shabazz when it really should have included you as well. The Jean Claude Baker book on Josephine Baker seems biased and unacceptable. For example, he states at the beginning that he """"hated her"""" and refers to himself eighteen times on the first page. Since he did not meet her until she was 52 it seems inappropriate to rely on his claims about her life when she was 20 or 30. The blanket statement """"Baker was bisexual,"""" written as if it indisputable, really has to go, don't you think? There is no evidence given except the claim of a fan who changed his name to hitch onto her celebrity. Doesn't this kind of TMZ gossip presented as fact diminish the biographies of people who have the courage to acknowledge their sexuality up front?209.212.5.67  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thank you for taking my suggestion by coming here to Talk instead of just reverting without explanation. I have indeed reverted some changes by Jayjg.  However, these changes were not actually improvements.  Briefly:
 act-now.org is brought up as an example of how """"circumcision advocacy"""" is a term used by some advocates, whereas Jay's version makes it sound otherwise.  Regardless of the subjective quality of the web site, suppressing any mention of it would be POV, hence unacceptable.  WP:NPOV is not negotiable.
 The definition of circumcision advocacy is accurate and not OR.  If you have some sort of specific complaints, I suggest altering the text instead of removing it.
 The article already mentions masturbation, you would like to omit the relevant and cited fact that masturbation is harmless and NOT prevented by circumcision.  Omiting this would be POV and WP:NPOV is not negotiable.
 Actually, what's reintroduced is the history with regard to advocacy, which is entirely relevant.
In short, these deletions all serve to harm the neutrality and comprehensiveness of the article.  Therefore, I will be forced to continue restoring the text if you attempt to remove it without an acceptable explanation.  Your explanations thus far are not acceptable.

As I recalled, the RYM was an arm of the U.S. Labor Party headed by Lyndon Larouche.  Interesting that Larouche who years ago was involved in NYC politics through his proxy cnadidates running for local office right into the 80s never mentioned Sharpton, or his affiliation with RYM.
It is also curious how the media, even African American journalists failed to mention that the original arbitors of the forced eviction efforts of Freddies was its landords, a black Pentacostal Church!!!???  Nothing of this was ever mentioned by the press.  And Sharpton never gave a clue to the public. Amazing.  So, it is true the allegations of Sharpton being and agent provocateur.  There are more inconsistancies, like his perfidy of the United African Movement and betrayal of Alton Maddox.  Now, Rev. Al is cozy with Obama and the New York County District Attorney's office?

GA review process

Well, the review process was instructive, as were the comments regarding how to improve the article. I had no idea that it was wrong to approach individual editors to comment (as I explained above it was to """"get the ball rolling"""" – naivety on my part, I'm afraid). I also think that Pyrotec's choice of language here (""""This review looks very much like a """"favour"""" being granted to the article's nominator by a co-conspirator"""") is very regrettable – perhaps he would like to retract it, look again at the six editors I asked to review the article (I chose a cross-section of editors experienced in CC pages but who had not made a contribution here – also explained above), and admit that he jumped to conclusions. Another example of why good faith is so important. Anyway in future, I'll just make a general post on the talk page about GA nominations. 
From the comments re: the article itself it's clear that the article needs work in certain areas. Specifically:
MOS issues, esp. with regard to the synopsis
Restructuring of criticism section and dealing with """"stubby paragraphs""""
Consistency in spelling 
Overlong sentences in synopsis (although Guetterda's criticism """"the synopsis is written in a narrative form - x happened, then the author introduced y, then z happened - which is inappropriate for the synopsis of a book of this form"""" may be misplaced as the book is a chronological account of this subject) 
Delingpole's review quoted in the lead but not the main body
 Further critical review needed/possible problems with tone
 Needs more images

That should be enough to be getting along with)) I don't regard the rejection as a setback, but merely a blip on the road to getting The Real Global Warming Disaster to GA status one day, in strict compliance with WP guidelines, though I still have reservations about how wise it was to choose a book from this subject area.

I am copying this from a section higher up on this same page. | Talk 

 19:51:33, 2005-07-31 (UTC).
Now - on with the explanation. The Coriolis effect is a change-of-coordinates force (and thus bears intriguing similarities with gravity, whether this means anything or not is unclear). When you move from one coordinate system to one that is rotating with respect to the first, then the equations of motion for a particle acquire an extra term: the coriolis term (and one other of second order in omega but we'll neglect that). So: if you wish to formulate the equations of motion for air on the surface of the earth, it is natural do to it in a coordinate system stationary wrt the earths surface: in that case, you end up with a coriolis force. You could, if you wished, write the equations in a system non-rotating wrt the fixed stars (perhaps ignoring the rotation of the earth round the sun). In this system, there would be no coriolis effect and hence no coriolis force. However there would be a very rapidly moving lower boundary to account for and this would be deeply inconvenient. since the coriolis term is easy to incorporate, there is no particular reason to do this. But... this is only the coordinate system in which you choose to write your equations. It has no effect on the physics, and cyclones continue to rotate no matter which system you describe them in.

The coriolis effect is *not physics*: it is kinematics.  19:51:33, 2005-07-31 (UTC).
[end of copied section]

William M Connolley is simultaneously saying that the coriolis effect is physics, and that it isn't.

An article about the coriolis effect should explain the following:.
If (hypotherically speaking) a low pressure area would form on a non-rotating planet, then the air would flow towards the low pressure area and the pressure gradient would very rapidly be leveled.

But that is not what is happening on Earth. On Earth, air starts flowing around a low pressure area, amazingly, it tends strongly to flow perpendigular to the pressure gradient, and it can take weeks for a low pressure area to become leveled again  So there must be a physical mechanism that performs a restructuring of the direction of wind flow.  

A general coordinate transform transforms the entire picture in one go, if you employ a coordinate transformaton to a rotating coordinate system on, say, a large grid, then the grid will turns around as a whole, with the whole picture remaining in a fixed form.

That is not what happens in the atmosphere! If you let go lots of weather balloons in the area of a low pressure area forming, then over time the positions of the balloons in the circling winds will be thoroughly mixed. The more central parts of the system rotate faster.

William says that the coriolis effect is to be understood as purely a cosmetic change: a coordinate transformation, that does not alter the physics taking place. 

But Willam also believes the following:
from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:William_M._Connolley/Coriolis_effect
The Coriolis force plays a strong role in weather patterns, where it affects prevailing winds and the rotation of storms, as well as in the direction of ocean currents. Above the atmospheric boundary layer, friction plays a relatively minor role, as air parcels move mostly parallel to each other. Here, an approximate balance between pressure gradient force and Coriolis force exists, causing the geostrophic wind, which is the wind effected by these two forces only, to blow along isobars (along lines of constant geopotential height, to be precise). Thus a northern hemispheric low pressure system rotates in a counterclockwise direction, while northern hemispheric high pressure systems or cyclones on the southern hemisphere rotate in a clockwise manner, as described by Buys-Ballot's law.

This is why I recognize that there are two contexts, that both called 'coriolis effect'. 
One context is about physical mechanisms, the other is about coordinate transformation.

As I read the Wikipedia guidelines, Harassment is regarded as far worse than any perceived COI.

 COI 
This is my statement
When I first took an interest in Wikipedia I scratched my head for subjects to take on. During the process of Googling old friends and acquaintance - as everyone does - I discovered that an old friend Greg Day was now running a PR company and I looked up one or two of his clients. Seeing that one or two - Kevin Howarth, Simon Rumley, were not mentioned on Wikipedia I thought that I would have a go at tackling them. I could have contributed to many other pages - and have - but I wanted to be the initiator of a page that no one had tackled before. Not long afterwards Greg Day got in touch and mentioned that he had seen the pages. He said """"how would I like to be an associate of the company""""  and - being a journalist and always looking for extra bits on the CV - I said why not. I then went on and edited Alan Jones and Hayley-Marie Axe, never thinking that any conflict of interest was involved. I still do not think that any COI was involved since a) I was never paid to do it b) I was never requested to do it c) I was trying to make a statement and not advocating or promoting anyone's career d) Writing and researching Wikipedia is just a hobby, end of. If that is so then you may as well say there is a COI over my edits of the Bolingbrokes and the Somervilles to whom my connections are no less nor more than the Howarths and the Rumleys - random topics of interest. That does not constitute a COI.

whatever you think best. I wouldn't mind, but this """"policy"""" seems to be applied in a random fashion and would only be fair if it was applied universally. Are you seriously expecting me to believe that the editors who originate pages about commercial product don't have some vested interests and/or COI. One would have to suspend disbelief to take that line. I have read not one but dozens of articles that do a wonderful job of promoting commercial interests. I guess it's one law for the independent editors and another for the corporations. Thus was it always. Rather than picking on people like me and making mountains out of molehills it would serve Wikipedia better to weed out the real abuses by cynical commercial interests rather than the perceived ones. 
Anyway, I do not own the pages discussed, so people can do whatever they like. I'm sure Jimmy wales never intended Wikipedia to become such a bear pit!

I am not sure how such a simple process of factually updating a wiki page has turned into what i can only describe as a strange obsession by a person calling themselves McGeddon. I have no idea what this persistent person who i can only describe as an INTERNET TROLL's motives are. I have been asked to update prominent south african artist wiki pages with factual information that is flattering to the artists therefore promoting South Africa. If that is a crime then i apologise but the fact is i have no connection to the artist apart from the country i live in and the love of art. In response to the Thandi Zambo and Thandi Moyo, they are both me, I couldn't remember my password for Zambo, which is my maiden name, so i made Moyo, which is my married name. This strange person McGeddon, who obviously is a very empty person with nothing in his life is harassing me and vandalising all my hard work. I see he does this to everyone, it's probably because he has no power in the real world. Anyway i am moving on from this project and i will have to change my username when i look at other south african artists to update their pages to save myself from harassment from this TROLL.

BTW I never submitted any of my books since 2002 to a regular publisher and I turned down a contract offer from a major German publisher for the German edition of """"Destiny Matrix"""". I will eventually hire a professional writer to cull the popular pieces from all of my books into a popular book that will be published mainstream. These books I am doing now are simply my preliminary sketch books, like Leonardo's - keeping notes for the historical record. As such many people will find them interesting. Also, as I don't need the money, I have not been doing what authors usually do to promote their books. I am too busy creating new content right now. Remember I am in Star Trek and on some major TV Shows and on IPOD Radio with RU Sirius and will be doing more of that bye and bye. If I wanted to go the usual route I could. I simply have not tried because I am not ready to do so. That is the fact.  -)

 Patrick - You can help in wherever you see needed improvement to D.C. United articles, and help one of the primary goals, which is to make the main Wikipedia entry on United an FA. From what JonBroxton has said, he's dead on. We should emulated the style of writing and content used in the Sounders FC entry. It's written in American English, and has numerous sub-pages that are also featured articles and or lists. 
 JonBroxton - I completely agree. The Sounders FC entry is easily one of the strongest MLS-related entries on Wikipedia. The American English style of writing and the specific angle focused on the American version of the game. And by """"league-specific"""", I'm presuming you mean the MLS Cup Playoffs, the """"regular season"""", and how the playoffs are not a cup tourney but rather a culmination of the regular season? 

And re: stadiums, that's probably a great way to start. Also, with the format of MLS articles, perhaps we can work with the Sounders FC task force to create an article format that's idea for MLS clubs and within the guidelines of the WikiProject Football.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Answer to Mütze
Well, I am surprised to see that I am unblocked! At least, you still have seen that you targeted the wrong person for the wrong reasons!!

Mütze, I have used this Wikipedia for only a few days but I am still not an idiot. Of course, what I say further below on what I think you did is an assumption but I believe a very good one! Here is what you did. You saw the following I posted on the Bosendorfer discussion page:
""""Very soon, this article will be published and you will have to leave it this way; otherwise, the censors at Wikipedia will be forced to side with me (!!) considering the fact that I gave you the opportunity to challenge what I wrote in my article."""".

As you clearly told me yourself, you did not want my article to be published. This quote clearly threatened you because I told taht I will soon publish my article and it will be with the full support of everybody because I used the discussion page of Bosendorfer. You then contacted Andrew Norman to block me to prevent me from editing the Bosendorfer discussion page and then you thought you could keep me away on my own user page with the intention of blocking me indefinitively. When you blocked me indefinitively through RobertG, you knew too well that no one could read my user page afterward! That is what I believe you did! And it is probably easily verifiable by people at Wikipedia.

Now, what is your role at Wikipedia? You are not an administrator; otherwise you would have blocked me yourself directly!

Anyway, I propose to carry on the discussion on the Bosendorfer discussion page concerning my article. I am ready to change sentences that cause problems. It is just up to you to mention these problematic sentences on this Bosendorfer discussion page and if you have a valid reason to have this sentence changed, it will be changed. I am not a fanatic and I am ready to please people. I will use logic and reason to assess a request to change sentences, not emotions. If I do not want to change a sentence, I will say clearly why and we could discuss further on this refusal to accept a change if it happens.

And I will answer the points you raised in your previous postings, Mütze.

So, I hope you will behave a little bit more relaxed about what I intend to do. The goal: publish a good article on a good product that inform people who read it. Apparently, for the time being, mostly the group of administrators and their friends (!!) who are the only ones who complained about my article so far.

But to have had to go through such a nightmare just to want to publish a good article on Wikipedia is surely not the right way to do at Wikipedia with people who are ready to contribute positively!! You are really going to put people off wanting to write on Wikipedia! And I especially target the administrators who have been in contact with me in a very aggressive way. Just a few days ago, I did not even know that what an administrator was at Wikipedia!

Here is what Jimbo Wales says on his user page:
""""Newcomers are always to be welcomed. There must be no cabal, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers."""".
If he knews what I had to go through and the very aggressive behaviour I experienced from administrators at Wikipedia, he would not be very pleased. What I say above, he call it one of his main principles!

So, administrators, when you contact people, make sure you remember this very core principle of one of the founders of Wikipedia and target the true vandals instead of people like me who are willing to add a good article to Wikipedia!

Jimbo Wales wants people to write as many articles as possible on Wikipedia. Your role as administrators is to help and encourage them to do so instead of trying to block them indefinitively!

So, I hope you can now all relax and not get emotional or upset on this coming article. I follow the process used by Wikipedia to deal with an article that causes opposition. See the new comments now on the Bosendorfer discussion page and state the sentences that cause you problems and especially why these sentences are problematic. Then, I will do my best to change them to please everybody.

 Comparison between articles, as far as notability judgments, are often inconsistent. This happens when small numbers of people respond, and for gray-area topics it can admittedly be very arbitrary which way the decisions go. I'd say this article has maybe a 25% chance of surviving this AfD nomination. Most current cryptocurrency articles clearly meets GNG criteria; while Wikipedia articles like Dogecoin attract ever-accumulating non-RS references that should doubtless be removed, its core is based on articles in the LA Times, the Guardian, CNN, NBC News, CoinDesk, and half a dozen other established news sites. Vertcoin has only one, the International Business Times, but surprisingly that was deemed sufficient to meet GNG. There is never really a """"final process"""" on Wikipedia, since a removed article can be reproposed when new coverage comes out, or an approved article can be renominated for deletion a while later (though it can be frowned upon if it's done frivolously). If it is deleted, I would wait for more clearly reliable-source coverage of the topic before trying again. There's really nowhere else that I think Reddcoin would be usefully mentioned in Wikipedia at this point, as it just doesn't seem noteworthy to independent sources. Auroracoin caught a lot of press because of its nationalistic hook, and Mazacoin kind of followed on its coattails, but other 2014-launched alt coins have needed to do something fundamentally different to attract much notice (e.g., Ethereum). Alt coins like Vertcoin and Reddcoin seem to offer almost no innovation, just minor adjustments to standard parameters, and have little purpose other than the creator and early adopters trying to make money off later investors. Reddcoin's """"use it to tip people on social media"""" comes several years after Bitcoin was used to tip people on social media. Maybe it will catch on due to better UI integration; time will tell, but it hasn't caught on in independent media so far. One way to try and game the system is to cause a quick price jump, which can be done a number of ways; IBT, ForexMagnates, and ForexMinute are prone to provide coverage even for some temporary price manipulation, and being idiotic news sources they treat any spikes as signs of popularity.

It is essential that the Able Danger debate be carried out in the places where it is relevant.  It is simply not relevant here.  If you can find legitimate news sources or counterterrorism analysts who provide a justification for its relevance here then it will be worth considering but right now it has no relevance whatsoever.  Your speculation about the credibility of the 9/11 Commission on issues not addressed by Able Danger is just pure speculation.  From someone, I might add, whose own credibility is very much in question.  I will continue to delete references to Able Danger until someone establishes their relevance in a meaningful way, not through a string of random speculations barely tied together by a thread like the above.  And again, let us please remember that the 9/11 Commission is not the issue here anyway.  The commission is cited but the pieces of evidence they look at are all pieces of intelligence brought out by other agencies.  As for the arrest of Iraqis in Germany, again, if you find evidence or even authoritative speculation tying those arrests to Able Danger we can consider it - otherwise it is just a string of increasingly bankrupt attempts at pseudo-logic. 05:11",0,0,0,0,0,0

fd7335d791075b92,"International Symposium on Dr Axel Munthe

The second  international symposium on Dr Axel Munthe’s  life and work   will be held  on Saturday 13th of September at Hildasholm, Leksand, Sweden. 

From the Royal College of Physicians in London, Professor Ian McDonald (adjunct Prof Dept. Neurology, Yale University also Prof. Emeritus of Clinical Neurology, University College London will be speaking on the relationship between Dr Axel Munthe and the famous Professor Charcot of the Salpetriere in Paris.

The eminent architect, writers and former curator of Villa San Michele, Levente Erdeos will be giving a talk on “The makings of Villa San Michele, some connections to contemporary art and thinking”

Other distinguished speakers include the Swedish author, Bengt Jangfeldt,Dr Peter Cottino from Capri, Mårten Lindståhl, Sweden, Dr.Katriona Munthe-Lindgren from London, and Prof.Alden Smith, Department of Classics, Baylor University Texas, USA.

When Munthe received his medical degree in Paris in 1880 at the age of 23, he was the youngest Doctor of Medicine in Europe. His thesis was on the subject of gynaecology and obstetrics. Munthe had, however, been deeply impressed by the influential Professor Charcot in the field of neurology, and therefore already at an early stage was greatly interested in general diseases.

In the same year he opened his first practice in Paris, which was frequented mostly by members of the large Scandinavian colony of artists. He lived intermittently in Italy where he helped the cholera-stricken population (1880 on the island of Ischia, 1883 in Naples).

In 1887 Axel Munthe left Paris and settled in Anacapri where he worked as general practitioner. In 1890 he opened a practice in Rome where he was consulted by foreign dignitaries resident in Rome, as well as by Italian patients. He was appointed physician to the royal Swedish household to care for Crown Princess Victoria, later queen, from 1892 until her death in 1930.

During the First World War Axel Munthe served as a physician in the British Red Cross at the front in France. He described his activities in the book, Red Cross & Iron Cross, which was published in London in 1916.

Axel Munthe became a legendary physician who always gave free medical treatment to the poor. For some time he maintained a hospice for elderly, destitute people in a castle outside Rome. He was an outstanding psychologist who was extremely restrictive in prescribing treatment by drugs. The preferred forms of treatment prescribed by Munthe included hypnosis and therapy through music.

The Story of San Michele entirely overshadows all other publications by Axel Munthe, although it includes much of what he had already written earlier. His very first publications covered a number of travel discourses which appeared in the Stockholm newspaper, Stockholms Dagblad, and which described his experiences of relief work during the cholera epidemic in Naples. These discourses came out in book form in Sweden in 1885, in England in 1887, and later in 1910 in Italy. Subsequently he wrote a number of other papers and short stories which were later collected and published: for example, Små Skizzer, published in Stockholm in 1888; Vagaries, London 1898; Memories and Vagaries, London 1908; Bref och Skizzer, Stockholm 1909; En gammal bok om manniskor och djur, Stockholm 1931; Vagabondaggio, Milan 1933; Ein altes Buch von Menschen und Tieren, Leipzig 1934, etc.

Hildasholm, the house that Axel Munthe built for his bride in 1910-1911, was designed by the architect Torben Grut (who would later create the Stockholm stadium). It lies amongst the trees on the edge of Lake Siljan in the heart of Dalarna.

 Surrounded by gardens and pine woods it looks over the peaceful
waters and comprises Swedish, English and Italian furniture and paintings
from the 17th, 18th and 19th century Europe. It is still used by the family
while also being opened as a museum for the public during the summer
months. 

The gardens were created by Axel’s wife Hilda on the promontories
and in the ravines surrounding the house where suddenly the well ordered
English garden breaks into the wild and romantic natural environment.

 Why ref to AP arch. inscriptions and valuable historical books removed 

Dear Sitush,

You have asked about the independence of """"Andhra Kshatriyas History by Pencommunities.matsa Krishnam Raju, Kshatriya vamsa ratnamala""""
earlier in this talk page. Its strange how you follow a different standard when it comes to Kammas page where you have vilified a caste book (Kammavari charitra by KB Chowdary) which is more of a Caste book rather an independent author, as it is 
written by A kamma on Kamma caste.
I may not be a full timed wiki author/ contributor like you, but I do follow same rules for all wiki pages and communities. my only concern is you have been following double standards in Kamma page may be its your community.

Apart from Andhra Kshatriyas History book,
you have also removed content which had AP archaelogical inscription sentences (http://www.whatisindia.com/inscriptions/south_indian_inscriptions/volume10/kakatiya_dynasty_1.html) and 
sentences from Pg 174 The History of Andhra Country, Yashoda Devi.

As you are the author for Kammas page plz be reminded that same rules apply for all pages, if some caste book can be taken as reference/citation, then can every other community can refer ther own community history books.
I request you to be fair to other communities also.

Hereby i am providing some valuable citations, others will be followed soon.

You are mistaken. The Johnson School is no different than the departments in the Arts College or the Engineering School. PhD students enroll in the Graduate School and pick a """"field,"""" which roughly correspond to the various academic departments (e.g., Chemistry, Management, Mechanical Engineering.)  The Johnson School is not acredited to grant PhD degrees.  I still think that the article is POV because its history and alumni list give short-shrift to the Public Administration and Health Care Administration aspect of the school. For most of the school existence, these were perhaps its most distinguished programs.  The idea of reassigning notable alumni from the school where they graduated to a different school based on subsequent reorganizations is troubling.  I think we should just have  the list of notable alumni in the main Cornell Univrersity article and the List of Cornell University people.  In some cases, there is no modern equivalent to the program which granted a particular degree and in other cases we may not know the school.  Does it matter that Ed Marinaro was a Hotel School graduate when he is notable as a football player and actor and never entered the hotel industry?  Does it matter that Keith Olbermann went to the Ag School and is therefore presumptively less credible than Ann Coulter?  Breaking down notable alumni based on the current administrative location of their degree program is POV and SYN.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 """"The Man of a Thousand Voices"""" 

I took the liberty of editing the following statement:

""""Little has long been known as a top impersonator of famous people throughout the world, which has earned him the nickname """"The Man of a Thousand Voices,"""" a name which notable voice actor Mel Blanc once held.""""

Besides the grammar errors (a title is not a """"name"""" or a """"nickname""""), the latter half of the sentence is not an objective statement  it makes it sound like Little and Blanc faced off in a bid for the title and Blanc lost. That's simply foolish and inaccurate.

Blanc was the first to be given this title and he will forever be """"The Man of a Thousand Voices"""". Little would more accurately be """"The Man of a Thousand Impressions"""", but Blanc's title has been used to refer to Little also by less-informed individuals (primarily media reporters unfamiliar with Blanc or his huge volume of work and repertoire that frankly make Little's look like a dwarf by comparison).

I changed the statement so it reads more objectively:

""""Little has long been known as a top impersonator of famous people throughout the world, which has resulted in him being refered to as """"The Man of a Thousand Voices"""" (a title also associated with voice actor Mel Blanc).

After Arkansas Preservation redesigned their web site a few weeks ago, there are a number of issues with the NRHP part of the site.  I have found at least two instances of listings that are missing from search results, and numerous PDFs of listings are also missing.  If you find what seem to be missing entries, you can try to find them the NRIS mirror run by Elkman, which has all listings up to about April 2010 (i.e. it has no listings or delistings after then).  If they show up in Elkman but not on the Arkansas Preservation site, contact them (info@arkansaspreservation.com), they're pretty good about responding.  On the old web site, I would report errors or omissions that would be fixed within a business day.  Sometimes the omission from their site is caused by an imminent delisting.  For bridges, you can also see if Bridgehunter has images or other information (like better lat/lon, which these two listings need).

In this case, listings for """"Cove Creek Bridge"""" and """"Cove Creek Tributary Bridge"""" both show up in Elkman (Tributary=95000644, Creek=95000645), and are given separate resource identifiers (in the """"Other Names"""" field in Elkman: Tributary=LO0051, Creek=LO0050).  Unfortunately, Logan County appears to be one of the counties whose nomination forms are not currently available on the web site, but they can send copies by email.  Bridgehunter has images of both bridges (look nearly identical), provided by the Arkansas Highway Dept. ''''♪piano """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I reject this notion

The article claims """"The defeat was attributed to massive vote splitting with the Greens, which in many cases allowed the Liberals to sneak up the middle and win""""  This claim is nonsensical when compared to the fact that the Liberals won 57% of the popular vote province wide.  Even if the remaining 43% had all voted for one party, the Liberals would have likely won anyways.  I personally went through the article and added all the vote totals for the NDP and Green candidates. (exlcuding the richmond and delta ridings because there was no totals)   I could only find 7 cases where, had ALL the voters for the Greens AND ndp voted for the same party, they would have defeated the Liberals.   If this had been the case the Liberals STILL would have had 65 of 72 (the legilature minus richmond and delta) seats versus only 9 for the NDP.  The NDP would still have lost 76.92% of their total seats in the legislature.  

So as a consequence I'm removing that sentence.

  

Well I agree that vote splitting played a role, to attribute the NDP's defeat to this is ludicrous.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Take a look at Major General - they are ALL 2 star ranks, but of the 40 insignia displayed on the page, 8 have no stars, 3 have one star and one has three stars. 
General officer#General ranks by country displays 26 insignia.
Admiral#Admiral insignia by country shows 16 insignia, of which only 5 have four stars.
If you want to continue your comparisons, you might find List of comparative military ranks useful.

As for the question, if races exist, the answer is clear: Races don't exist, because Spencer Wells, Guido Barbujani and Alan Templeton say they don't. Every other opinion is a misinterpretation of facts by racist bigots. Well, there are few seemingly racial clusters appearing in recent genetic studies, and they very well agree with the classical anthropological division of humans. Furthermore, when geographical distance is constant, the genetic distance between groups within these clusters is several times lower than between groups from different clusters. The main detected bareers of genetic flow are also consistent with the borders of traditional races. Moreover, the genetic distances between these clusters are typical for mammals routinely divided into subscpecies by biologists. However, this all must be due to some misinterpretation of facts by racist bigots, because Spencer Wells, Guido Barbujani and Alan Templeton say that race doesn't exist.   22:56, 22 April",0,0,0,0,0,0

There will be scheduled meetings on every Tuesday at 14:00 in room 111. All group members are required to attend these meetings. Please remember that success of group projects highly depend upon productive group meetings, so please try to make every single one of them.
 
These meetings will start from next week, 6th October Tuesday. I would be heading the first meeting as the Chairperson and Sam would be the Secretory. The post of the chairperson and secretory would keep on rotating so that everyone is involved in this group project.
 
As discussed in today's meeting there are a few tasks that need to be addressed before the meeting on Tuesday, 6th October; which are as follows:
 
    *
      Setting up a Wiki Forum to have an effective group communication system and also providing easy access to the projectmaterial to all the group members. Tejal volunteered to set up the forum. All details of it will be passed on to all of you as soonas it is finished.
    *
      Coming up with conceptual design and ideas for the payload because as we all know payload is most important driver of thesatellite design, so ideally that would be the first step in our project.
    *
      Also please note down the email IDs of all the group members for future contact. And don't forget to buy a log book foryourselves.

You know what, forget it. The guy who was repeatedly changing the opening and led me to post what was previously here, because he repeatedly refused to answer the simple question of why (except of course to start SHOUTING) has reported me for not being civil. How ironic is that. Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists. You do find out what Marco Rodríguez does for a living though. So yay for that. I guess once you get to the end, you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal, but that's assuming you haven't fallen asleep, or shot yourself, having read the same four words - Brazil, Germany, biggest & loss (and their million variants), multiple times. Seriously, if people here think what's currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way, perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. It's not quite garbage, but it's not good. And please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are """"unencyclopedic"""", frankly you couldn't be more wrong. There's no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation - that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match, both now and in 20 years time. If you don't want it to be in this one, please think of a better reason than """"unencyclopedic"""", if only that the victims might have a clue what it is you actually mean.

That said, on the offchance anyone with any ability for writing gets around to working on this article, here's what the opening should look like, if you're trying to engage the reader while summarizing the key points. It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.

Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.

You quickly forget that I am objecting to the MISINTERPRETATION of a 'rule', and the MISAPPLICATION of a 'rule'.   (or, do you not concede that, hypothetically, a VALID, proper rule can be MISINTERPRETED and/or MISAPPLIED?).  Merely citing the RULE is pointless, when the problem is the misinterpretation or misapplication of the rule!
 Further, Dodo violated WP rules, by not allowing a consensus of the group to develop.  He also misapplied a rule, claiming that something I said must be 'verifiable'.  But what does it mean, to be 'verified'?  Dodo implied that what I said must be verifiably, scientifically TRUE.  I claim, quite to the contrary, that since the article involved is 'Jim Bell' (subject, ME), that the only 'verifiability' issue is this:  Did 'James Dalton Bell' ACTUALLY make these claims.  (Or, conversely and hypothetically, 'is someone else forging his identity?, etc.)   For example, there was no need to RUSH and delete my posts.  Rather, somebody (preferably, one familiar with LOGIC) could have said, """"Bell, how do we know that 'you', 'jimdbell@q.com', is in fact the 'jim bell' (James Dalton Bell) who is the subject of the 'Jim Bell' WP article?  We need to be able to VERIFY the fact that 'jim bell' actually said/did this."""" (To ensure that 'jim bell' is not being libelled by a stealth forgery.)
In response, I would have immediately said, """"Good question!""""  And I could have promptly proceeded to do whatever was necessary to establish this fact.  Perhaps I could also have donated a recent (current!) photograph to the article, which (of course) could be compared with other published (even if not public domain) photographs which are available on the web.   
But as John Belushi was so fond of saying, 'BUT NOOOOOOOOOOO!'  Rather than HELP a 'newbie' (to WP), AND wait for a consensus, and actually help VERIFY that 'jimdbell@q.com' is actually, 'jim bell', Dodo decided to be an ass and repeatedly delete my edits.  And, he deleted ALL my edits, not merely some portion which (allegedly) was not 'verifiable'.  I will give an example, to the contrary:  I also posted a claim that I accused the Feds of forgery in a criminal appeal case, 99-30210.  In fact, in June 2003 I wrote a lawsuit (195 pages) which has (I believe) LONG been posted on the Web.  (Probably Cryptome/JYA).  It (as I recall) makes exactly this accusation.  So, if Dodo had actually acted INTELLIGENTLY, he would have edited my edit to cite my lawsuit, which has been posted for perhaps 5+ years.  (Or, he would have said to me, """"Bell, you need to show a cite of your lawsuit..."""").  THAT would have been productive, useful, and helpful.  (As opposed to being hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.)   So, why didn't Dodo do THAT?!?   The answer is quite simple:  Dodo is hostile, counterproductive, and malicious.  He's a 'control freak'.  (Apparently, WP attracts 'control freaks'.)  Rather than being assisting, supportive, and helpful, Dodo wants to slap around newbies who upset his apple cart.

The mere tone of your reply displays that you have a personal problem with me.
Apparently, you think I have some connection to Sante Kimes. I have repeatedly denied this unproved accusation.
I am only a researcher of many well-known court cases and my only concern was the tone and POV displayed on the Sante Kimes article. I haven't even had much of a chance to read over the other articles listed on Wikipedia that I have researched, because of the issues with this Sante Kimes page. The article began going in a neutral point of view, then you began to change the tone of the article. I don't understand it, other than you have a biased opinion. I posted discussions on the discussions page regarding changes that I thought were needed.
You could have simply changed the article to say """"Sante Kimes is a convicted murder"""" if the small change I made was that horrible to you. I think the change to the lead you made is just out of spite because I said """"being a con artist is not a crime"""". I actually meant it in a joking way, not to criticize you, but you apparently took it as an attack because of what you listed in the edit note in your reply and at around the same time you changed the lead info.  
Had you posted on the discussion page about his first, I would have talked with you about it. The change I made to the lead was from a neutral POV. I don't know how it was not.
As for saying """"American woman"""" that is listed for several female criminals in their lead information on Wikipedia.
An example is Susan Smith, one I happened to notice before changing the lead on the Sante Kimes article to """"American woman"""". There you have it - where I got """"American woman"""" from.

 Your comment in the Serbian-Americans talk page 

I was checking that talk page to see if anyone had maybe listed new data to a question I had posed a few months ago and I saw your comment there. I thought it was interesting.

I've never before seen someone else write about an """"American ethnicity"""" the same way I have thought about it. I know that the Southeast has the greatest number of people declaring their ethnicity as American, but I think this ethnic label would apply to the majority of racially White Americans and not just those in the Southeast. The Americans (outside of the South) that descended from pre-20 c. immigrants from the UK, Ireland, and Germany seem to have substantially = meshed together into a """"White ethnic group"""", not just racially, but ethnically as well.

The only cultural differences between ethnic Whites of the North (where 19c. immigrants mostly settled) and those of the South is that the South still experiences religion and social conservatism as very influential forces on daily life. Where for the more recent ethnic Whites, this is not the case (e.g. in the North). So, the distinctive cultural aspects of the South have not been adopted by the ethnic Whites of the North even with several centuries having passed. I do not want to make false generalizations, however this is my sense of the average situation in those regions based on my travels and time spent living here. 

The areas where distinct ethnic identity has been conserved is in the major cities. The city-centred ethnic groups in the US have preserved a substantial part of their culture in absence of preserving their language (for the most part). A few well-known examples would be the Irish- and Italian-Americans of the Northeast. So long as their numbers are high enough to have a large enough community - cultural traditions endure. What I am getting at is that so long as a Ukrainian-American stays in a major city s/he has no reason to be forced into completely adopting a new ethnicity. S/he won't have to abandon the culture of his/her community. If s/he were to move to an area in the Southeast, then it would be a completely different story. 

I'd like to give you a further illustration - the Poles of Chicago. Most arrived somewhere between the 1850s and 1940s or so. Many have had families there for well over a century. There has been very limited migration out of Chicagoland for this period and the Polish community there has remained extremely strong. So there is not much past observation that would suggest that cities are only an entry point from which ethnic communities later break-down as they go their own ways. 

I've written all of this to demonstrate how the """"ethnic Americans"""" and people who ethnically (not racially, but ethnically) identify as """"White"""" are distinct ethnically from the more recent (post-1850) European ethnic communities in the major cities. I find it all very interesting. The only problem that sometimes arises is when individuals do not make the distinction between an """"Ameican""""/""""US citizen"""" and an """"ethnic American"""" and in so doing sometimes end up labeling certain individuals as being un-American. These people, that do not make the distinction, show frustration when a person does not abandon his/her culture and adopt their own. This is of course on an individual-by-individual basis and I would not generalize this in any way to any region or sub-region.

I've seen ethnic hostilities projected towards myself or family/friends from people of all sorts of backgrounds. I've seen it demonstrated by Southerners, New Yorkers, and even Jews in South Florida. By the way, most of the time my ethnicity (and that of family/friends) would have been indeterminable by those people. I'm saying this because I don't want to suggest that any particular regional group of Americans is more racist/discriminant than another region. I've spent a lot of time in South Florida and the racist attitudes that come from some of the people there have been really surprising at times especially when you take into account that many of those racists that I have come across would themselves been the target of racism less than 50 years ago. Its all unfortunate and these types of racist, discriminatory, and nationalistic attitudes are probably present in most countries. 

The good part about our differences is that ethnic Americans and newer Americans have no trouble in cooperating with one another when it comes to maximizing profit. This is not the case in say many areas of the former Yugoslavia or in the areas where ex-Yugoslavs have settled throughout the Western world.

Sorry for the lack of brevity. Your comment was interesting and I wanted to expand on it. Also, I want you to know that none of the above is meant to be offensive towards any group or the US or the US as a whole. Usually when I do",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Why delete without notice? 

It is my understanding that articles are not removed without discussion or notification.   The flag itself assures this.   It has been less than 24 hours since I submitted my first wiki article - and twice in that time I have had my article removed  without notice,  without comment on my defense points and  without opportunity to make edits. (with the exception of one who answered my response back to them - and I thank them)  

I am new here.  I posted my article to wiki.   The first administrator came along and made a minor change to my title.   I had modeled my after multiple examples of others in the same industry as posted to wiki - but not really a big concern to me. Happy to learn best practice and perhaps the other 5 articles are not good examples.  

I then had a user flag my article for speedy delete. 

Very quickly - A second administrator deleted my article.  If I'm reading the chain correctly - it was deleted something like less than 10 minutes after flagged.   No one notified me. No one gave me the opportunity to make changes or instructions as to where the specific problem was.  

Per the """"item deleted"""" page that suggests you work with the other parties involved, I first contacted the user that flagged my article and the administrator who deleted it.  The user said his concern was that it sounded to him like advertising and noted on what points.  I wrote a very detailed response to him telling why the information he noted was presented as it was, addressing his source concerns, etc..   He has not followed up with me - I assume that means no problem with my response?  Or perhaps busy doing other things.  

I also forwarded the defense response to the administrator who deleted my file.   Before sending the him points of defense (I was still drafting), he did send me a note saying it was an """"advertising"""" concern.  He pointed me to a general help page (which I'd already read) and a page where I could retrieve the original version of my article.  Combined with the point to the article - and no reply to my defense - I took this to mean Go again with it.  

I reposted the article - and had another user flag it for advertising - but no specific information.  I removed the tag per the box's instruction that I could do so as long as working on resolving the problem.  I responded to the flagger in great detail and requested specific feedback.  (which was then deleted and marked as too much detail) I replied again in a more brief response.   I added the hang on notation.  

I am now addressing you because you have deleted my article - without any comment or notice to me.  I assure you that I am not being difficult - but am very frustrated with the lack of interaction and guidance I am receiving here.  It seems easy to hit a delete - but of little interest to provide anything specific like assistance.  Am I wrong to assume administrators are supposed to be a source for information and assistance - wiki mentors if you will.  My experience on my first day using wiki has been that administrators shoot first - and don't care in the least about even asking questions later.  In fact - they will ignore them.  

I do not believe you could have read the contents of the talk page in the period of time lapse between the flag and your delete.   I expect that before deleting my article - one would check the talk page and see if the matter is being addressed.  This is what the flag box ASSURES me that is wiki policy to do.  I have extensive notes on the article sources and answered all questions in a very timely fashion - but I cannot understand why I seem to be the only person following a procedure.  

I hope this is simply a matter of catching a couple of administrators on """"off"""" days.  I am very frustrated with the lack of administrators following what I understand to be their own policies.   Please review my talk page and advise.  I also respectfully request that you reinstate my article.
I await your response.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

2) See the award-winning documentary: """"Brats: Our Journey Home"""" by Dona Musil (it won 19 awards). 

3) See numerous novels released in the last several years on the Military Brat experience. 

4) See the Oscar Nominated movie """"The Great Santini"""" based on the book by the same name by Pat Conroy.

No one of these works alone could represent the whole military brat experience but they altogether point to the existence of a huge identifiable sub-culture commonly known as """"Military Brats"""".

You know that the name change is not at all the whole point here. The problems here such as heavily relying on Chinese sources, inaccuracy in historical facts, copying government propaganda, are commonplace not only in this particular article but most all topics on nations colonized under China. And further, if the current situation continues on Wikipedia, you cannot guarentee the so called NPOV. Not only that will be a joke, the whole Wikipedia thing will end up being another hypocratic, """"civilization"""" game. The biggest issue here is the mentality behind the creation of these articles and problems here, hence the debate and this is just the beginning. You have to realize that the overwhelming articles on China-occupied regions on Wikipedia are full of POV but not NPOV. So don't keep fulling yourselves. It's time to wake up now.

Those who're currently in advantageous positions here, are so not because they're intelectually and morally strong but just because their numbers are bigger. They are basically consisted of two types: One types are those Chinese who're either been brainwashed and/or are chauvinistic fanatics. And the other types are Americans who (naturally) have so little knowledge about the world outside of northern America. But then they would have hard time admitting that and therefore, they will end up either pretending as they know or they would simply echo the Chinese POV which is largely circulated and readily available. For them, the famous saying, which goes like if you repeat a lie a thousand times it would become the truth, will make perfect sense. That """"truth"""", or what you guys are shouting here as """"the common"""" names and stuff, is exactly what is blocking not only your eyesights but as well your human consciousness.

One big difference between the two types though are that the Chinese here do know what they are doing because they have their agenda and they're intentional. But the Americans are just naive and are being used.

 Might interest you.. 

In one of my linguistics courses, we studied the usage of the proper /ing/ ([ŋ]) pronunciation on present participles (ex- running, hopping etc) versus the substandard /In/ pronunciation (runnin', hoppin') among various social classes in the US. It was found that in working class families that the /In/ was much more common, even in formal interviews, with it being less often used when reading a text or passage. In middle class and even lower middle class families, the /ing/ was used much more frequently. I guess the point is, who's right?

MESSAGE FROM YOGIRAJ GURUNATH AND HAMSA YOGA SANGH

Dan, thank you for sharing the message from Yogiraj Gurunath Siddanath. I was impressed with the message and the tone of it. Wikipedia articles, unfortunately, are not the places to convey one's spiritual state. And the NPOV policy attracts, and even requires, naysayers and doubters. I've seen this in articles of great souls that I KNOW have deep realization. Fortunately, there are better places for sharing realization and spiritual teachings. May you quickly reach self-realization, and my apologies for some unkind things that I said in all this. As your Guru said, """"Let us meditate more and talk less!""""  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Instead, you just notice that the costs covering your phone usage have been charged from your phone balance.

Let us (at least me), we the ones that don't have the power of moderators, let us uphold reason and above all truth of facts and reality, that this pig by the name of Fidel Castro is not only a communist criminal but is a devil in its own right.

Reply from ColonelHenry
I have been pissed this week, I admit. Why?
 First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical """"rule nazi"""" editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly """"this user is an asshole"""" and explain why and state """"this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia"""" I get blocked for 24-hours.  I say """"asshole"""" once, I get blocked.  She calls me a """"dick"""" over a dozen times, and gets warned.  Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi.
 In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to """"wait until after TFA"""" and he still ignored it.  If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize """"hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA.""""  A little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine.  I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful.
 And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth).  Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time?  I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's """"Will to Power"""" or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our.

As for why, I like """"nineteenth"""" as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for """"brevity's sake"""" on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted.  That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to """"kick rocks.""""

As far as I'm concerned, this is over. Move on. I am not addressing this any further, because nonsense like this keeps me from contributing and convinces me to leave Wikipedia again, and this time for good.

This new state would be rulled by Serbs, others would be subjected while Muslims(of any ethnicity) would be distroyed(by genocide sense it´s the only way). They called there Army chetnik, them selfs chetniks and there by this ideology(which is fashist) is chetnik. And any1 who follows it is a chetnik.

The plan failed untill 1918 when the Serbs managed to create a """"Slavic Kingdom"""" which was actually ment to become a Serb Kingdom which was with time shown, during WWII the chetniks allied with the Nazis and commited GENOCIDE. After the death of Tito the chetniks ressurected and tried everyting all over again but ones again failed thank God.

Now, the chetnik PROPAGANDA is used to make Serbs think that it is right to do all that and to foole everybothy else, this propaganda includes showing Bosnia as a """"Serb state"""", Bosniaks as  """"Serbs"""", spreding Islamophobia and Anti-Bosniak settlment or presenting the Serbs as the victoms and so on. THAT site does all that and it is enough to open it and you will see. Now you ain´t nobody so I don´t have to proove anything if you don´t see it then you are either stupid or a chetnik your self.

4fff8b434eb6241f,""":It is neither more historically correct, nor more professional. Scholars routinely use the term """"Nazi"""". You cite the Encyclopedia Britannia as evidence of your claim. But, in fact, the Encyclopedia Britanica uses Nazi an order of magnitude more often than National Socialism. In the online version of the Encyclopedia, there are 10,200 references to Nazi and only 1020 references to """"National Socialism"""". And in the title of the entry for """"National Socialism"""", they write """"also called Nazism or Naziism"""". 

Your claim that use of the term """"Nazi"""" is amateurish is a slur on the overwhelming majority of scholars who routinely use the term. The claim that """"National Socialism"""" is a """"more full and correct designation"""" is inconsistent with the fact that the two phrases are synonymous. And while it is true that """"Nazi"""" can be used as an epithet, so can """"dog"""". Do you also recommend that Wikipedia refrain from using the word """"dog"""" to describe dogs? 

It is interesting that you use Linder as support for your argument. The particular passage that you link to is an explanation by Linder as to why he will use the term """"Nazi"""" rather than """"National Socialist"""" throughout his book. I fail to see why this is evidence that Wikipedia should do the opposite.

I am curious about your statement that use of the term Nazi arises from a deeper intent by political opponents to give a skewed view of their politics. What part of Nazi politics do you feel has been skewed by their political opponents?

For some reason, none you never even looked at anything on the affected page or talked to anyone about the problem, nor did you ever even try to talk to me, you just ban away. It has been KNOWN for a very LONG time that the user Gwernol is a sock puppet.

Jimbo himself edited the article and told people to only populate the article with FACTUAL items.

The article had been being picked on by several editors (sockpuppets) all matching Gwernol's ip address.

I removed everything Gwernol had written and he comes to you to attempt to block me, and without even TALKING to me you blocked me.

Congradulations on failing the Wikipedia Administration test, I believe you will be removed within the next few days as a Wikipedia Administrator by Jimbo himself, we have been discussing your actions over the last 24 hours.

BTW, I'd like you to know, your block had no effect on me whatsoever.

 Welcome to Wikipedia. Although everyone is welcome to contribute constructively to the encyclopedia, one or more of the external links you added  do not comply with our guidelines for external links and have been removed. Wikipedia is not a collection of links; nor should it be used for advertising or promotion. Since Wikipedia uses nofollow tags, external links do not alter search engine rankings. If you feel the link should be added to the article, please discuss it on the  before reinserting it. Please take a look at the welcome page to learn more about contributing to this encyclopedia. 

Your edit here was reverted by an automated bot that attempts to remove unwanted links and spam from Wikipedia. If you were trying to insert a good link, please accept my creator's apologies, but note that the external link you added or changed is on my list of links to remove and probably shouldn't be included in Wikipedia.

The external links I reverted were matching the following regex rule(s): rule: '[a-za-z][0-9]{2,}\.photobucket\.com/albums/.*\.jpg' . If the external link you inserted or changed was to a media file (e.g. an image or a sound or video file) on an external server, then note that linking to such files may be subject to Wikipedia's copyright policy and therefore probably should not be linked to.  Please consider using our upload facility to upload a suitable media file.

Please read Wikipedia's external links guideline for more information, and consult my . For more information about me, see . Thanks!   

Granted - yes, they are links.... but to PHOTOS intended for that particular entry. They are of the album, the tv show, and the video respectively.

All Trayvon had to do is call the cops if he was soooo scared. 

The cops did NOT tell Zimmerman NOT to follow him. There's a HUGE diff btw a 911 operator and a cop. Telling someone 'we don't need you to do that' is NOT the same as a direct order and finally, Zimmmerman claims he DID stop following at that point.

If EIGHT BLACK TEENS were CAUGHT robbing people in that neighborhood, not to mention the ones that didn't get caught, then you'd have to be an IDIOT to not eyeball someone acting as suspiciously as Trayvon. For all we know, he could have robbed someone in the sub in one of his visits. We know the cops said he had a jewel-thieving tool. 

Oh that's right, the cops are not to be trusted. Except when they tell you 'We don't need you to do that.' Then you MUST obey! lol

3. You brought up those stupid wikipedia policies as if I'm fucking retard that doesn't know the rules. Honestly, who do you think you're fooling?

4. You brought the unpopular/unfathomable name, """"Jason Anthony Griffith"""" to my talk page which really pisses me off. It's not enough that someone would pull something so stupid as to try to start shit by deleting the info someone types themselves and going to their talk page to gloat about it. 

What the hell are you, some kind of amature? Wikipedia is for people concerned with adding the real facts and nothing but that. Not deleting info and not even giving back more or less HALF as much as what you took away.
We don't need shit like this.
The only reason you absolutely require a source instead of taking the word of the people THEN trying to hide behind wikipedia's stupid policies is because you just want the article to look clean. Well stand by for news, the truth isn't clean and orderly. It doesn't have to be. The one this is all about doesn't agree with the information that WILL still be up? Let Jason Anthony Griffith take it down himself. If not, the truth STAYS up. I don't care what you try and say.

It is also accurate to say that area has no extent - just like a point or line. Area only begins to take on understandable dimensions once a point or line is assigned extent. As an example: If a line is made up of 3 points of zero extent, it's length is zero. If it is made up of 3 points whose centers are half a unit from the circumference of a circle formed around the same, then the line has length of 3 units.

First thing you need to know, is that Good Article status is a crock of shit. The criteria for it is a fair model, and it is not the problem. The problem is that it is not governed by a committee. Any bozo, like yourself, is allowed to review an article and ultimately decide if the article, in their mind, merits inclusion into CGD (Club Green Dot). The bar sits firmly in the mud. Snakes slither across it. My articles, on the other hand, never have enjoyed the benefits of exception. With extreme prejudice, they have been held to the highest possible standard set by the criteria.

Now we get to your GA review of Howling Bells, which I would like a full explanation for. That's one of the agreements that I have set forth, in order for you to avoid failure of your articles, by me. You can decide if you would like to abide by this resolution or not. Tell me something, are you on drugs, prescription or otherwise? If that offends you I apologize, but your review made me think of three things. Either somebody took a shit on your face and you couldn't see through it, you had a big D in your ass, or you were in a state of incoherence brought on by substance abuse. I must confess, I'm ashamed that I'm even having to talk to some punk ass high school kid who listens to crappy music. Not that I feel that I hold a higher place in this world than you, because Lord knows that's not the case. It's just that, I'm sittin' here having to deal with some goddamn little kid over the computer. Even at your age, I know you understand where I'm coming from.

There's not much of a reward getting an article to GA status, aside from that dot. A small part of me would like to see the article at GA, but it really doesn't concern me a whole lot whether it gets there or not. Howling Bells is at GA and that's basically good enough for me. As far as Halfway Gone goes, at this point, it's outta my hands. You're just gonna have to accept the fact the article could possibly be de-listed. Consider that your penalty for fuckin' around with other people's hard work.

Ok, so there are two agreements I have come up with that I think are very acceptable.

A full explanation of your GA review of Howling Bells (album). I'll guide you through it on the review page. If you decide to play ball, good on ya.
You must say the following to me, here on my talk page: I, , am just a punk ass teenager, who loves Justin Beiber, loves the crappy music of Justin Beiber, and loves crappy music from many other crappy artists.
The font has to be huge too, none of this small crap. Also, see if you can do it in some kind of color, that would be cool.

Now, I will not pass your articles if you agree to this, but I will not fail them. Instead, I will explain on the review pages that any reviewing of the articles that I have done up until this point should be disregarded. My reasoning will be because of my inexperience as a first time reviewer has led me to realize that I am not capable for such a task. I will wash my hands of the articles, take them off hold, and request that another editor undertake the review. If you are unwilling to accept these agreements, than you leave me no other choice but to expeditiously fail the articles. Let me know what you wanna do kid.  (meow)",1,0,0,0,0,0

We call that petitio principii, don't we? Apparently nothing will change his mind until I change my pen-name to something like John Doe. How does he know that I am not this Russian dude who likes Iranian history and culture? Oh, that's right, he doesn't. He probably didn't check my IP-address to see that I'm based in Sweden and could in fact be a Swede. Whoops... Sounds like our neutralist is using a subtle profiling method to his convenience.

Like I stated before, it doesn't matter if I'm a Nazi, Communist, Liberal or even a hippie. It doesn't matter if I do drugs, or if I look even remotely like a reptile. It doesn't matter if I'm even an obese Tongan kid. It has no bearing on content or the essentials of an argument, and anything else you might conjure to the favour of some imagined affiliation. This is aptly called speculation.

Now, I will only say two things. First one is a rehearsal of my previous suggestion: Livius.org is visited by thousands of people daily. Along with a number of other scholar-related websites, I can't live without checking it by a daily basis. It deserves a Wiki-article, where Jona Lendering is briefly described as the founder and maintainer of an outlet with roots as far back as -96. Yes, sounds like a plan of revenge. The paragon of Pan-Iranic resurgence! The removal of a Wiki-article of Lendering will remove the last great obstacle to a resurgent Achaemenid empire and the reawakening of the terrifying Persian horsemen of doom! Howl! Howl! Our world is forfeit!

Second point, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart: Get laid. Your superior-inferior complex isn't convincing anyone here, whether they be Iranian or not. There is no chance an article of this quality gets to stay. That's the bottom line, irrespective of any perceived reasoning. Either change the article so that it pertains to Livius.org, or stop your incessant whining. Maybe it never occurred to you that by simple observation Jona Lendering has written several Iran-friendly articles and has generally sought to dispel several popular misconceptions on the ancient Iranians. Maybe that's how you make more drama in your life, by arbitrary holier-than-thou attitude.

Depp remembers, """"He saved it all. Not only is [the book] true, but there's more. And it was worse.

Bill,

I don't find your un-edits a gender-based attack.  I am largely concerned with the content of the article itself, but I wonder why you put up so much opposition to my very small edit.  Surely it can't mean that much to you.

I don't want to make derogatory comments about men.  I have nothing against men, and I don't enjoy tearing people down.  You mention the term """"well-referenced"""".  I prefer for statements to be well-referenced too.  I don't think that this particular statment is well-referenced, and furthermore, I don't think that it can be well-referenced, because I don't think that it is true.  And so I wonder about the author's neutrality.  Wikipedia articles are supposed to be both neutral and well-edited, and that statement is neither.

I don't want the article to be deleted either.  I think that it serves a useful purpose, and I enjoyed reading it.  I just want to do away with that particular sentence.

Of course, if you can find evidence that American women are materialistic sluts, then we have no problem at all.  But I'm pretty sure that whoever wrote that was confusing personal opinion for universal truth.

Since Neturalhomer chooses to edit his User Talk page to erase the past, I will post the relevant exchange here (he gave """"removing vandalism"""" as the reason for editing it out; his only tool is a hammer, perhaps, so he sees me as a nail, perhaps)

Your Lie(s) About Me

You wrote: """"Final Warning

Saying things like """"DC101 IS HIS FUCKING EMPLOYER!!!"""" and """"Don't be a douche"""" is a good way to get blocked....fast. Tone the language down...and pay attention. Greaseman ain't dead. If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia, I will report you to AIV and to your ISP, Verizon. Stop now, this is your final warning. - NeutralHomer • Talk """"

Yes, I did use the language (on a talk page) and if it will make the booboo feel better, I apologize. But who doesn't enjoy a nice summer's eve?

BUT, you need to STOP LYING about me. I never said the Greaseman was dead, only that his death had been reported by sources considered reliable by Wikipedia standards. A little attention to detail on your part would be much appreciated, Eve. Otherwise, perhaps it is I who shall report you. Tell you what: you admit and retract your lie and I will consider the matter closed. Fair?

Let's look at your odd writing style: """"If you continue, to add continued, now, lies to Wikipedia,"""" Just what are you going for there?

I've never put a lie on Wikipedia, contrary to your assertion. Anyone who lies about me can go screw.

Your threat to report me to my ISP (FOR WHAT, EVE?) is beyond pathetic. Two pops for yes!! Report away.

Now, the admin who blocked me said that more than one reliable source was needed on sensitive matters.  He did not research sufficiently to reach a correct conclusion.

Let's all remember, shall we, that I never said that Greaseman was dead, simply that he was REPORTED DEAD.  There's a big difference, and the fact that it was reported is not in dispute.  I NEVER SAID GREASEMAN WAS DEAD.  Yet Neutralhomer continues to assert that I did.  THAT IS A LIE.  I consider someone lying about me a personal attack, under Wikipedia guidelines.  Is this a """"separate but equal"""" or """"separate and unequal"""" system?

The admin who blocked me wants more than one source that someone said something on the radio.  Let's look at Wikipedia's entry on Cesar Romero's personal life, shall we?  There is NO source cited for his death, nor his homosexuality, yet those are all sensitive topics, are they not?  Why doesn't Neutralhomer report the author of this page for vandalism?

The fact that Neutralhomer claims that dealing with me gave him a migraine on the talk page of the admin who blocked me demonstrates that this is a personally based effort on his part.

To recap: I never lied.  I never vandalized.  That should be enough.

Now let's look at Wikipedia's reckless report of Cesar Romero's death and homosexuality, shall we?  Sensitive matters, no?

Personal life

Romero believed in liberation theology. Romero was very Christian yet still believed in a utopian society whose belief is that Christ's kingdom would be very similar to Marx's envisionment of communism, and held to this belief until his death.[1][2]

Romero always claimed his grandfather on his mother's side was Cuban poet and patriot José Martí, although his mother's parents were legally Carmen and Manuel Mantilla with José Martí as his godfather. There was some speculation that Maria was fathered by Martí who was a boarder in the Mantilla household, but he never claimed Maria as his daughter in his lifetime.

Romero was never married, despite proposing to at least one woman. Romero made regular appearances on the Hollywood social circuit, usually in the company of an attractive actress, and he was almost always described in interviews and articles as a """"confirmed bachelor."""" Romero discussed his homosexuality in a series of interviews with author Boze Hadleigh, with the understanding that they would not be published during his lifetime.

Romero wore a man's tennis bracelet inscribed with his favorite nickname: """"Butch."""" The term was reportedly bestowed on Romero by his one-time dancing partner Joan Crawford, who teased Romero by telling him: """"You're so butch!"""" While Romero's homosexuality was an """"open secret"""" in Hollywood, the movie-going public was unaware of his sexual proclivities and there was never any embarrassing scandal surrounding his male liaisons, which shows the care and finesse with which he conducted his private life for more than 60 years.

Romero was a mainstay of the Hollywood social circuit until his death in 1994. He was interred at Inglewood",0,0,1,0,0,0

Again, you disgusting cretin, you accuse my statements of being laughable, yet have no logical basis to believe so. You think I believe my arguments are gospel, eh? So you're the kind of person who believes that if everybody believes something, then you should go along with them? So you're the kind of sick bastard that would've condoned slavery just because everybody you knew did? I do not at all think my arguments are gospel, I just proudly stand by my word until a logical argument will present a sensical contradiction. You're the bastard who has some sort of personal agenda attatched to this and for some reason or another, you refuse to have it changed, like a no-good dirty hippocrite.

Dude, sorry for the rough language, but you are one fucking dumbass idiot. Everything I type is extremely intelligible and free-flowing, if you will, yet you seem to interpret it WAY differently than it is obviously stated. My sentence, """"You seem to think that this is some sort of """"battle of the dialects"""" (lol), and seem to think that this is what I seem to think (now, that's redundant!) as well, but as I've CLEARLY stated, this is not so"""", makes perfect sense and only an idiot would not understand it. I wrote it redundantly to prove a point, not because I lack verbal skills. The point being, that you are an idiot and you can't understand the symbolic (or even literal) nature of my posts, and you interpret it into something that somehow benefits you and your cozy little world view. Ok, this will be the 100TH time I've had to clear something up for you, but let me tell you what this sentence means:

You seem to think this is a """"battle of the dialects"""". At the same time, you assume I am thinking the same thing. However, I DO NOT think of this as a """"battle of the dialects"""" at all, I think of it as a LOGICAL consensus that needs to replace the current one.

If you discerned something other than this, than you are retarded, hands down. I can't understand why you make all these radical interpretations, especially when most of my words are plainly visible. I am in NO WAY contradicting myself here, and if you can't understand this, then I am in NO WAY going to argue with the mentally retarded, for the guilt would prevent me from having peace of mind for quite some time.

About the Standard English, obviously, this article was written by a British person, and is extremely POV, thus is not a valid argument against this issue. That's like basing all your knowledge about drugs on government and anti-drug propaganda. 

Please man, let's put some sense into this argument, and remove all the non-sensical bullcrap you've included into. And don't ever, EVEr fucking tell me to go away, got it?

Oh please. My sole argument with him was on the content boardwhere, if you'd note, I agreed with what he was saying, just not the manner in which he was saying it. He is the one who is being abusive towards others, including me, ``he`` is the one who is taking opportunities to make this a battleground, not me. More to the point, I was responding to you. Saying """"Oh that's just how Malleus is""""? That's bullshit and you know it. He is causing the problem, and yet I'm punitively blocked? You have really got a strange sense of humour. I simply will not stand for people making allegations about meand that is something Wikipedia needs more of, not less. Other people come by and read things, they never look into the history, and allowing bullshit such as Malleus commonly spouts to stand means that he gets to dictate reality. →  ₪

This dumb racist wannabe-Jew moron actually thought he was having an intellectual discussion with """"ElliotJoyce"""" when """"ElliotJoyce"""" was none other than """"Vost"""", the same user that had ripped Malik Shabazz a new asshole months earlier. But you know what the funniest part of all this is? I WIN. I literally have about 17 other accounts that have absolutely nothing to do with """"Vost"""", """"ElliotJoyce"""", or """"Accreditor"""", and I've used those accounts to transform Wikipedia articles to match my tastes, which usually means countering the racist garbage from pseudo-intellectual cancers like you sweety. See, from all of the edits I do, you dumb idiots pick up only a fraction to revert- while I've been keeping you busy with Vost socks (which itself is a sock of another account), I've committed over 200 edits under the radar from special-proxy rotations in the last 4 days. I have 2 admin accounts, 5 non-admin accounts of previously active users which I've since been able to commandeer (more on this later), and about 10 standard self-created accounts. What's even more hilarious is that the reverts engendered by my socks usually cause enough notice to the article that I don't even have to do anything to get my views to dominate: I let other users add fuel to the fire that I started. But you know what the absolute kicker to all of this is? I got you, yes you, you Jew-wannabe, black racist cancer smear, to violate numerous Wikipedia policies and your own Wikipedia philosophy by going after me, vendetta style. I BROKE YOU ON YOUR OWN TERMS. And even after all that, my major points and edits prevailed. I win, and considering that your power level on Wikipedia is considerably more entrenched than my own, my victory is that much more devastating. The IP I'm using at the moment, courtesy of the 24-hour computer lab in my dorm, is about 1 of thousands of batch IPs I have access to, which gives me even greater security and privilege to spread myself over Wikipedia in case my special proxy rotation is ever categorized as a proxy, and thus blocked. Oh, and regarding the commandeering of accounts: graphical analysis password bypass and deconstruction (GAPBAD) is a rather effective means to obliterate CAPTCHA; its use is only feasible at specific time intervals when security measures on the target fluctuate or do not register properly. Guess which account is getting targeted next as soon as Wikipedia undergoes its next server hash? ). You've been warned in advance. Just remember: I win. You can't do anything to me. Go back to being a Jew-wannabe sweety. Jews are white, not black. Remember that too- that's why you're not accepted and never will be accepted by mainstream Judaism or Western society as Jewish.

While at Harvard College 19-year-old Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg allegedly used login data from his social network to hack into fellow students email accounts; that evidence also included instant message transcripts where he calls facebook users """"dumb fucks"""". The alleged following exchange is between a 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg and a friend shortly after Mark launched The Facebook in his dorm room:
 
Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard

Zuck: Just ask.

Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS

[Redacted Friend's Name]: What? How'd you manage that one?

Zuck: People just submitted it.

Zuck: I don't know why.

Zuck: They """"trust me""""

Zuck: Dumb fucks.

In another instant message (IM)

FRIEND: so have you decided what you are going to do about the websites?

ZUCK: yea i’m going to fuck them

ZUCK: probably in the year

ZUCK: *ear

I cannot believe that people are so deluded to think that this guy Richard Kastle deserves a damn wikipedia page. 

Why not give every single person who plays piano a page of their own... HELL, why not let anyone just put up a page about themselves. Not only was he previously featured in a video DAMNING deceased pianists about their playing (accusing them of simplifying the ending octave section of Liszts 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody), but hasn't done anything to deserve any special credit. Apart from his compositions which truly aren't anything brilliant - in fact, they're almost bland and boring (from a compositional point of view), he seems to ride on the credit of having played two compositions brilliant (which seems to be the deluded, sick, biased opinion of a guy called MikeCaffey on YouTube) when in fact his playing is sloppy and usually completely drowned in pedal, completely disturbing the balance of sound in the music. 

Now this deluded, sick individual on YouTube (MikeCaffey) seems to go about praising Dick (short for Richard, and far more funny to refer him to that, than Richard) for his compositions, deleting valid posts by real pianists and piano players alike, possibly in an effort to sweeten the image of Dick to others. As a pianist myself, I can safely say that playing the end of Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in c sharp minor brilliantly does not alleviate ones status to piano-god, and even if it did Dick STILL wouldn't be a piano God since he seems intent on drowning the ending with pedal, completely destroying the cleanliness of the parading octaves. 

Letting this slanderous leech of the musical world have a wikipedia page seems insulting to other pianists who truly have talent. Although they may not care whether they have a page or not, I find it insulting to the profession of pianism that Dick has a page of his own.

You suck Jpgordon, even if you admins/checkusers find our IPs and block them for long periods of time, all we have to do is press the reset button on our modems and within 5 minutes we would get a new IP and be able to vandalize again. As a result, I hope you admins realize that blocking is useless. That is indeed what I always do when I get blocked. And to save you the time of yet another checkuser, the IP I am using now is 174.91.92.166 and in case you haven't figured it out, I previously used the IP 174.91.97.28 (see https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&page;=User%3A174.91.97.28), which was blocked for 3 months yesterday (useless block, it's quite easy to circumvent it).",1,0,1,0,1,0
