Dick Cheney is the first sitting Vice President known to have shot someone since 1804, when Aaron Burr shot and killed Alexander Hamilton in the Hamilton-Burr duel.

This is clearly an attempt to tie Cheney to a deliberate and malicious shooting.

Main points AGAINST this article (RfC)
Information that shows irregularities, tendentious editing, vandalism and POV on this article should written here:
I will start from what looks to be the main problem. 
Albanian nationalism refers to nationalism among Albanians. It should not necessarily show only claims made by certain circles as is done in this article. So the first sentence of the article: Albanian nationalism (also known as Albanianism[1][2][3][4][5] or Pan-Albanianism[6][7]) refers to nationalist Albanian ideologies and theories that were cemented during Communist Albania (1945-1991), its continuation into modern Albania, as well as its proliferation in Kosovo is a POV. Albanian nationalism does not refer only to ideologies and theories that were cemented during Communist Albania... it refers also to Albanian national uprising and Renaissance and Albanian national pride. 
Kosovo is a disputed matter and to say: """"The struggle for the liberation of Kosovo from Serb rule became the struggle for the recovery of the ancient land of'the Dardanians and thus a re-creation of their ancient kingdom"""" is a POV. Here are references that beg to differ One, Two, Three and Four. For more read Kosovo.

Let's start from these two issues! —

Even drawing the conclusion that the movie has """"received generally positive reviews"""" is putting spin on it, because what we really mean is that """"Rotten Tomatoes regards 90% of the reviews they sampled to be positive"""".

Thanks for uploading Image:Fosternirvana.jpg. I noticed that the file's description page currently doesn't specify who created the content, so the copyright status is unclear. If you did not create this file yourself, you will need to specify the owner of the copyright. If you obtained it from a website, then a link to the website from which it was taken, together with a restatement of that website's terms of use of its content, is usually sufficient information. However, if the copyright holder is different from the website's publisher, their copyright should also be acknowledged.

As well as adding the source, please add a proper copyright licensing tag if the file doesn't have one already. If you created/took the picture, audio, or video then the  tag can be used to release it under the GFDL.

Hi there! Thanks for the edit, I really appreciate you helping to improve the article.
I have something to say about your edit, however, and I wanted to take you aside a moment and work this out.

The problem sort of exists with the original too, and i've been trying to think what we can do about it.
See, a sizable chunk of people still do know it as 'the alien from alien', and our job is to correct those people when they look it up.

Its a problem with the article I was planning to tackle after the xenomorph issue was settled (if it went that way). The way you have phrased it sounds like its just some uncommon secondary name, which is not ideal, but neither was the way I did it.

Basically it needs to say """"You might know this as alien, but you would be wrong"""", but in wiki language. I've hit a brick wall with how to do that. I'm hoping you might have some ideas for that.

Do you think we could work out some nice sounding way to introduce the article a bit better than it currently does?

 Disagree. Her parents may have lived elsewhere at some point either before or after her birth, but multiple sources already used in the article even list the address of the house she was born in - in Hampstead Garden Suburb, which is neither Golders Green nor Hampstead but another London suburb. Clearly London alone is vague. That's like saying New York, without specifying which borough. Or saying Los Angeles when you mean Santa Monica, Burbank or Malibu. It does make a difference. Seems to me that if we are not specific, we're just inviting endless debate from editors who will want that specificity. We have the correct info now. Best to just use it and leave it.

Other examples exist. Why Kane/Undertaker from WMXX, but not Undertaker/Michaels from WM25, another match which was heavily promoted and considered for the final match on the show?

If you want to have the image removed from the article or only linked to it, then by all means engage in consensus building mechanisms to achieve that balance.

Hi. The issue here is very simple.  The article currently states there is """"NO"""" evidence that ECT causes brain damage in humans or animals.  The article also states that there are """"NO"""" recent reviews that found such evidence.  Both of these claims in the article have been proven to be grossly incorrect. Yet a paragraph is devoted to it.  Because such fallacious claims are made often however, a paragraph was written pointing out an example of a mouse study pointing to the contrary, and also cited a new study that found that ECT compromises normal cerbral blood flow in humans, possible evidence pointing to brain dysfunction.  The information is sound, supported, and appropriate given the subheading and the preceding paragraph that promotes gross misstatements of fact by saying that there is """"NO"""" evidence of brain damage in humans or animals, and """"NO"""" modern reviews pointing to such evidence. (And yes, there are reviews, as has been proven.)   

The progression of arguments to the contrary here is quite odd and revealing:

1) First the paragraph was too long and was trimmed down and a study removed.
2) Then there's an argument that the two studies don't directly relate to one another and shouldn't therefore be in the same paragraph, even though it's abundantly obvious why they are (to contradict previous paragraph finding """"NO"""" evidence in humans or animals, and provide an example of study finding brain damage in mice, and an example study finding compromised, abnormal cerebral blood flow in humans)
3) Then an argument that this mouse study should only be a minor footnote that no one will read (even though the reason it's there is to provide an example that yes, there IS evidence)
4) Then an attack is made on the design of the study, apparently suggesting that it isn't evidence because of the mouse strain chosen. (which I disagree with, and regardless it's not a wiki editor's place to challenge the mouse strain choice of expert neuroscientists who make this stuff their life's work  it's their study. Moreover, it isn't the superiority of the study that got it here, it was listed as an """"example"""" that YES THERE IS EVIDENCE IN ANIMAL MODELS OF BRAIN DAMAGE).
5) Then the claim is made that the mouse study struggles to support the paragraph.
6) Then the mouse study is called trivial until it's replicated (even though again it was added as an """"example"""" that YES, there is evidence, not because of overriding importance)
7) Then I pointed out in the talk page that one of the """"NO"""" evidence claims made in the preceding paragraph in the article is that there are no modern reviews finding evidence of brain damage. I proved this claim to be false, and cited to Peter Breggin, a very well-known MD who has written a book on the topic and a recent comprehensive review of the literature citing close to 200 references and finding numerous evidence of brain damage in animals.
8) Then Breggin is personally attacked, apparently suggesting that his published review isn't good enough to disprove the """"no evidence in recent reviews"""" claim, because he's not a """"reliable source."""" (I also point out that there are other reviews finding evidence, including one done in the Russian mouse study).
9) Then in response to me writing that there there either IS evidence of brain damage in animals or humans or there is not, and that a single study stating that brain damage was found in a modern study can defeat the harsh claim of """"NO"""" evidence of brain damage in animals, it's argued that """"that's not the way that science works"""", and """"several studies also can mean squat"""". 
10) Then it's argued I can't negate """"secondary"""" sources that found no evidence of brain damage in animals or humans with direct """"primary"""" sources of published experimental studies which found such damage as part of their experiment. (This is not to mention that there are also other published reviews finding evidence of brain damage in others' work).
11) etc.

In addition to this, it's claimed that this single paragraph briefly showing a couple studies pointing to possible adverse effects (the subheading IS Adverse Effects, btw), violates the Wikipedia policy of undue weight.  This is incredibly strange as the paragraph immediately before the new paragraph is entirely devoted to multiple claims of """"No evidence"""" of braind damge in humans OR animals.  If a paragraph can be devoted to """"No evidence"""" stating untruths, then one can and should be added afterwards to give a couple of examples of this evidence which is claimed not to exist. 

Of course, the real problem here is the paragraph boldly asserting """"NO EVIDENCE"""" with regard to studies in humans OR animals of brain damage.  This has been proven to be false. The paragraph also asserts that """"NO"""" mo",0,0,0,0,0,0

 If you want a real example of bottom-feeding, take a look at Netty's last edit to this Talk page. Some time ago, I substituted a template on this page, which he had previously peed on; thus this page got tagged, as a template, for deletion. A couple days ago, my nemesis decided the continued presence of {tfd} on my Talk page was an embarassment, and he attempted to remove it. Check out the smarmy edit summary.

Basic concept of GPS
A GPS receiver calculates its position by precisely timing the signals sent by GPS satellites high above the Earth. Each satellite continually transmits messages that include
 the time the message was transmitted
 satellite position at time of message transmission
The receiver uses the messages it receives to determine the transit time of each message and computes the distance to each satellite using the speed of light.  Each of these distances and satellites' locations define a sphere.  The receiver is on the surface of each of these spheres when the distances and the satellites' locations are correct. These distances and satellites' locations are used to compute the location of the receiver using the navigation equations. This location is then displayed, perhaps with a moving map display or latitude and longitude; elevation or altitude information may be included. Many GPS units show derived information such as direction and speed, calculated from position changes.

In typical GPS operation, four or more satellites must be visible to obtain an accurate result.  Four sphere surfaces typically do not intersect.  Because of this, it can be said with confidence that when the navigation equations are solved to find an intersection, this solution gives the position of the receiver along with the difference between the time kept by the receiver's on-board clock and the true time-of-day, thereby eliminating the need for a very large, expensive, and power hungry clock.  The very accurately computed time is used only for display or not at all in many GPS applications, which use only the location. A number of applications for GPS do make use of this cheap and highly accurate timing.  These include time transfer, traffic signal timing, and synchronization of cell phone base stations.

Although four satellites are required for normal operation, fewer apply in special cases. If one variable is already known, a receiver can determine its position using only three satellites. For example, a ship or aircraft may have known elevation. Some GPS receivers may use additional clues or assumptions such as reusing the last known altitude, dead reckoning, inertial navigation, or including information from the vehicle computer, to give a (possibly degraded) position when fewer than four satellites are visible.

Qumar:deletion
This… I don’t know where to start!
In no particular order:-
.a)I found this had been deleted when it turned up on my watchlist,, though I never saw the discussion there; presumably because it was on another page, and this deletion looks like an afterthought.
.b) “decision was to merge with The West Wing # Foreign …""""
Well, actually it wasn’t.
3 voted for merging Equatorial Kundu and Qumar in a new page Fictional Countries in the West Wing;
2 voted for merge and re-direct to WW#F (3 if you count yourself)
2 others had no preference.
In the event you didn’t even do that; a search for Qumar leads to the top of the WW page, making it necessary to scroll through to find it.
.c) I find it hard to believe this would be agreeable to anyone who is interested in, or has contributed to, the WW pages; does that describe anyone who spoke on this decision? 
.d)The reason for the proposal isn’t that clear; “not notable”? So where does that leave all the other pages about fictional characters, places, histories?
.e)“can be re-created if sources are found to establish out-of-universe notability”; what does that mean? If it’s referred to in a book, like a commentary on the West Wing (though you don’t know, and haven’t checked, if there is one)? (for the record, there are at least 5 in the British Library Catalogue, and at least one in our town library; shall I check? Would it make any difference?
.f)“theres nothing on the page that isn’t said elsewhere""""; Well, there was quite a big page before (from memory), now there’s just a paragraph, so something has gone. And if information is in several places, what does it matter? It makes sense to repeat things/items/details from various places onto a single page to make the information more accessible; even real encyclopaedias can do that, the more so a virtual one.
.g) ) The page wasn’t (again, from memory) badly written, or un-encyclopaedic, especially compared to some of the pages I’ve seen; is WP so big that we can afford to be tearing decent pages out? (it’s still not as big or as comprehensive as a decent-sized city library).

 Proposition 

This article is overwhelmed with images of socialist emblems. This is not a gallery, this is an article about socialist heraldry, and it is no rally useful to have images of every single socialist emblem ever used. I think we should make an inclusion criteria for images of emblems in this article. I propose this inclusion criteria: 
We should only add to this article images of emblems of internationally recognized states that existed for more than few years. If the state used several similar emblems during it's existence, they should not all be added, but only the one that was used the longest.
According to this proposition, we don't need emblems of unrecognized states like Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic and Luhansk People's Republic. We also do not need three emblems of Socialist Bulgaria () because they are very similar, practically the same. I am going to remove some emblems according to this proposition.

The article implies that Congress mistakenly defunded the organization due to the later findings that the employees did nothing illegal.

My advice to Sensei48 is to form a skirmish line, and hold that position. Do not retreat to the timber. Neither should he order a “charge to the rear”: that way disaster lies.

Raise her Gold and Blue,
And cheer with voices true,
Rah! Rah! For Notre Dame. 
We will fight in every game
Strong of heart and true to her name.
We will ne'er forget her
And we'll cheer her ever,
Loyal to Notre Dame.

Cheer, cheer for Old Notre Dame
Wake up the echoes cheering her name,
Send the volley cheer on high,
Shake down the thunder from the sky,
What though the odds be great or small
Old Notre Dame will win over all,
While her loyal sons are marching

Aramaean scribes in the Assyrian empire were always picture alongside Akkadian scribes. That at least points to the fact that they lived alongside each other and just as with Sumerian and Akkadian society merging to form classic Babylonian society the same happened of Akkadian/Assyrian society.

Observation duly noted, with this response...

It isn't just that """"elements"""" of French's affidavit is based on other people's stories,  the fact is he swore that """"all facts and statements contained in this affidavit are true and correct.""""  And that included second and third-hand gossip about Kerry's military record in Vietnam.  This guy is  an officer of the court; I find it hard to believe he didn't know what he was doing. 

As to his claim about Kerry lying on MTP in 1971 about his unit being engaged in """"atrocities,"""" let's consider what Kerry actually said:

 SEN. KERRY: There are all kinds of atrocities, and I would have to say that, yes, yes, I committed the same kind of atrocities as thousands of other soldiers have committed in that  I took part in shootings in free fire zones. I conducted harassment and interdiction fire. I used 50 calibre machine guns, which we were granted and ordered to use, which were our only weapon against people. I took part in search and destroy missions, in the burning of villages.  All of this is contrary to the laws of warfare, all of this is contrary to the Geneva Conventions and all of this is ordered as a matter of written established policy by the government of the United States from the top down. And I believe that the men who designed these, the men who designed the free fire zone, the men who ordered us, the men who signed off the air raid strike areas, I think these men, by the letter of the law, the same letter of the law that tried Lieutenant Calley, are war criminals.   

Those sorts of things took place, and were documented as taking place - and in fact were mostly SOP. Even SBVT member William Garlow found  Hoffmann's tactics distasteful . French is not being truthful, or is at best being disingenuous if he simply doesn't think these things should be referred to as """"atrocities,"""" a term that Kerry was quite clear in qualifying. 

And compare French's description of Kerry's """"mutiny"""" remark with what he actually said:

 The fact of the matter is that the members of Coastal Division 11 and Coastal Division 13 when I was in Vietnam were fighting the policy very, very hard, to the point that many of the members were refusing to carry out orders on some of their missions; to the point where the crews started to in fact mutiny, say, """"I would not go back on the rivers again"""" ... 

A little different from claiming that he said """"crews at An Thoi were involved in amutiny,"""" isn't it?  We know for a fact that there was plenty of disgruntlement over SEALORDS policies (read Brinkley, for instance), and officers did refuse to carry out some of Hoffmann's orders .  Is Al French prepared to say no crewmembers ever refused to go back up certain rivers or on particularly foolhardy missions?  We know for a fact the lack of air support was so bad that RF/PF forces  refused to go on patrols without helicopter support.   French is knocking down his own strawman.

I think there's plenty to question in the other affidavits, especially Elliott's and Letson's, but again, I have no problem including them alongside all the other interviews and accountings in the reference section.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

First, I would observe that there was a nearly unanimous consensus in Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Winzapper to retain the article.  Every established user who commented at the AFD besides you supported retention of the article.  Under such circumstances, the AFD discussion would almost certainly have been closed as """"keep"""" regardless of who closed it. I doubt that there would be many administrators willing to delete an article as a result of an AFD discussion in which many established users supported retention of the article, and not one established user besides the nominator supported deletion, unless the article constituted a serious WP:BLP violation, a copyright violation, or was otherwise exceptionally harmful, or there was clear evidence that comments favoring retention were the result of canvassing, abusive sockpuppetry, or other unacceptable activity.  Why?  Simply put, the strengths of arguments offered at AFD discussions do not exist as absolute quantities which are not subject to any reasonable dispute.  Instead, the perceived strength of arguments varies as a function of the person evaluating them.  So, an administrator who decided to delete an article in the face of essentially unanimous support of established users for retaining it would be putting himself in the position of claiming that his personal judgment regarding the merits of the arguments presented was so far superior to the judgment of every other established user who expressed an opinion at the AFD that his personal opinion properly outweighed nearly all others.  An administrator might properly advance such a claim only in rather exceptional circumstances, which were not present here.  This is not to say, however, that AFD discussions are decided purely by counting the votes of established users: they clearly are not.  Rather, the applicability of the principle that AFD is not a vote is subject to limitations, which are most clearly reached when there is absolutely no support by anyone except the nominator for the deletion of an article.  Administrators have been known, on occasion, to delete articles as a result of AFD discussions in which a clear majority of established users supported retention of the article, if they personally believe the arguments for deletion to be more firmly supported by Wikipedia policy or otherwise more persuasive; even in such cases, however, they generally require some substantial support for the deletion of an article before deleting it (though the supporters of deletion may be distinctly in the minority).

As a corollary to the principle that administrators quite rarely delete articles against a nearly unanimous consensus for retention at AFD, it is quite rarely the case that there would be a nearly unanimous consensus for the retention of an article that was in clear violation of Wikipedia policy or otherwise clearly needed to be deleted.  While it is true that Wikipedia's verifiability and notability policies require that articles concern topics of which there is significant coverage in multiple third-party reliable sources, and while the presence of such sources in the article itself at the time of the AFD provides the clearest possible evidence of notability, there is no support, in either Wikipedia policy or practice, for the contention that any article which comes to AFD without the necessary sources to establish its notability, and to which no such sources are added during the AFD discussion, must therefore automatically be deleted.  Rather, where it is reasonably believed that the sources necessary to establish notability are likely to exist, the  community may choose to retain the article, even if such sources are not present at the time of the AFD.  So, if someone were to nominate, say, our article on the National Electrical Code for deletion on the grounds of inadequate sourcing and failure to establish notability, the article would properly be retained, even if sufficient sources weren't produced during the AFD discussion.  Often, the belief that acceptable sources can be found for an article is little more than subjective opinion.  Consequently, arguments of the form """"keep, I believe this subject is notable"""" are valid at AFD, if a sufficient number of established users assert them.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello - I came across your query on the discussion page for the New Rochelle Post Office. If you want the correct information you cannot rely on what Orlady has told you. She is the sole individual objecting to the use of the term 'mural' when referring to the artwork that is in the building. The building is a NRHP however not so much for the architectural significance, but for the murals inside. Specific reference to the term 'mural' can be seen in a number of sources that were provided.  These sources include very reliable documents including: United States Post Offices in New York  1858 to 1943  Thematic Resources (the National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form), The Westchester County Planning Board discussing the post office in relation to re-developing the site,further discussions,  and the New York Times article about the artist selected to paint the murals. The nomination form is the most irrefutable source validating the information (it specifically references two of the three murals when discussing the importance of post office art). Additionally, the city of New Rochelle continues with redevelopment of the area and has recently come to the decision that the significance of the building itself is minimal, with its only true attribute being the 'distinctive curved contour' of the front facade which is familiar to residents of the area and should be maintained. (Im sorry but I cant find this specific document at the moment). The continuing reverting of this information is entirely the result of Orlady who personally does not seem to care for the facts. Unfortunately it is resulting in a deficient and inaccurate article. I also should mention that blocking users as alleged puppets of a banned user seems to be the most useful means for Orlady to control the content of certain articles. She is clearly abusing the tool. The validity of her claims is questionable at best. I was blocked as a result of my contributions to this article, and was labeled a 'sock'. Considering that I am in no way connected to the banned user, I found it rather disturbing to be blocked based on 'evidence' that has absolutely no validity whatsoever. Perhaps you can spend a moment to review the information provided and the facts will speak for themselves. Thank You",0,0,0,0,0,0

Aha! So Kayla and Kailina are the same; but there's more to be explained. After checking some more sources I think we can be sure of the existence of at least two separate Agaw dialects/languages (just like Bender 1976:8 says; but unlike Ethnologue and Sommer 1992): first, Qemant-Kemant-Chemant-Kamant-Kimantinya-Kimanteney, and secondly Kayla-Kaila-Kailinya (ethnonym Betə Israel (cf. Mann & Dalby 1987:16), xenonyms Falasha/Felasha from Ge'ez 'immigrant, stranger'; Yihudi (cf. Ethnologue 1992 as cited in Sommer 1992). Kemant could be extinct by now (Sommer 1992 mentions that """"according to Gamst, Kemant is threatened by extinction""""). In any case, a huge language shift is going on here; all speakers are bilingual in Amharic and according to Ethnologue, only 1650 native speakers of Kemant were left, out of an ethnic group of about 170,000 people in 1998. Endangered, to say the least.
Quirin (1998) leads me to believe that an important reason for Qemant and Kayla being separate languages is that their speakers (coming from a common Agaw base) developed separate identities from the beginning of the 14th century on. However, apparently there's a lot of fuss going on in Beta Israel historiography (cf. e.g. ) and I don't know enough about it at present to judge sources like this (though Qurin seems to have done his homework).
Anyway, a third dialect seems to be Qwera/Quara/Qwarina/'Kara of Kwarasa'/Hwara/Hwarasa; this one appears to be extinct (cf. Ethnologue). It seems to have been related more closely to Qemant — Gamst (p.c. to Sommer, Sommer 1992:358) proposes that """"Quara, Quarinya, spoken by a few Falasha in Quara (to the west of Qemant-land), is nearly the same language as Qemant.""""

 Gabriel Olutola 

There are some issues with Gabriel Olutola, which I just deleted.

I had previously identified some concerns with this article. You seem to understand that there were issues and agreed to address them. We let some time elapse so you could address them, but you did not make any substantive progress toward resolving the problems.

In addition, you are not communicating in a way that is desirable for editors. You are perfectly free to remove material from your talk page (although archiving is generally considered preferable). However, if you simply remove material and do not respond, it is difficult to understand your thinking. I don't know for example, whether you felt that you cured the copyright problems, or perhaps thought that the source of the text was an acceptable source. If you explain your actions it will be easier to help you.

I recently deleted the article because it had copyright problems and I saw no action by you to address them. I now see that you have restored the article in substantially the same form as the article that was deleted. Again, if you do not communicate I do not know what you are thinking. I don't know whether you thought it was deleted in error, whether you thought you cured the problem, or something else.

I notice that the version you restored is not exactly worded the same way as the source. However, we have seen editors who think that changing a word here or there cures a copyright problem. It does not. Please read the following link for more information: Wikipedia:Close paraphrasing

I also ran a duplication detector which does not pick up close paraphrasing, it only picks up exact matches. Even with this cruder measure the article is problematic. I'll provide the link below so you can see the results. However, I emphasize that changing a word or two here or there to eliminate the exact matches is not the cure.

Duplication Detector

Unfortunately, we have identified other articles with issues. I haven't had a chance to look closely but we may be following up with other articles which need addressing.

I urge you to take this quite seriously. If you are editing with a misunderstanding of policy we can help you understand the rules. If you do understand the rules and ignore them, you may be blocked. Explaining your actions will be the best way to ensure that doesn't happen.(Talk) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I know Persians say Azeri are Iranians and Turks say Azeri are Turkish. But the truth is Azeri are a independant people with a combination of the two nations. Medes merged into Persia, the first Persian King was Cyprus and he was half Azeri! After the Persians the Turks took over. We learned they culture and language and still use it today.

For Canada and all other Commonwealth Realms (except for England itself), the monarch appoints a governor-general to take over his or her duties in the realms. Canada and any other country needs a monarchical head of state, because it's a neutral person (and not coming from any party) representing all the People and avoids the country to become a dictatorship. He or she stands for stability, democracy and justice. One only point I don't like on monarchies is that in most of present monarchies the husband of a reigning queen becomes Prince Consort instead of King Consort. That should be changed. And now to the USA: the president is not elected by the People, but by electors. Second, there are only two parties, which have real chances to become ruling parties due to the restrictions of the Constitution.

Scott, i think that is evidence that you still just don't get it.  this has nothing to do with string theory.  string theory is non-sequitur.  i hardly understand string theory (really, just the pop stuff Brian Greene puts on Nova), but i fully understand the argument that, in reality, the only physical quantities that we measure, that we perceive, that make any difference to anything that involves us as human beings (or E.T. beings, for that matter) are dimensionless quantities.  when something changes that affects us, ultimately it's a dimensionless measure, usually the ratio of like dimensioned quantities.  we always measure a dimensionful quantity against another like dimensioned quantity.

if  changed (let's say got bigger), conceptually, that would have meaning, the electromagnetic force (relative to the other fundamental interactions) would have changed in proportion (gotten a little bigger).  then it would appear that the charge of an electron has gotten a little bigger (but it might not have) or that Planck's constant has gotten a little smaller (but it might not have) or that the speed of light has gotten a little smaller (that's the choice you and authors such as Moffat made) or even (if we're gonna say that  might have changed) that the permittivity of free space has changed (like ,  is defined in many measurement systems, such as SI or cgs).  (i doubt anyone will argue that it's  or  that has changed.)  heck, someday soon (i would expect within a decade)  will be defined (because of a redefinition of the kilogram).  if they do that, then a change in  gets blamed on a change of , which still seems most natural to me, but that's my opinion.  even so,. if they did that to  and  was measured to have changed, i would not argue that all of the electrons and protons and positrons in the universe have somehow transferred charge.  i would say that they appear to have a different charge since their strength of their interaction has changed (which is fundamentally all a change in  can mean).  that is all we would know or could ever know.  to blame any conceptual change of  on a change of any of the dimensionful ingredients to it, is silly.  16:04, 19 Mar 2005 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0

Origins
The genesis of this page was as the cobbled together embarrassment of an article List of Charmed episodes as it was constituted around the new year of 2009. (See also: Talk:List_of_Charmed_episodes#Article_split_into_subpages and the following section of Talk:List of Charmed episodes) Subsequent systematic improvements to the inadequate alledged synopses of that page gradually showed by late in the month, the page needed split. Subsequently, the list of episodes was split out into four seasons pages, and concurrently work began transforming that page into a page with a table of articles, without the synopses, which will be handled by pages like this one.
These subpages are named to form the series links:

I notice that we have a Category:European goddesses. It would appear that most European goddesses are individual personas, just like everywhere else. I think what some writers appear to have done is gather evidence that a particular triplet of goddesses associated with fate seems to be attested across Europe (going way back to whenever).
I think a little confusion arises because this reality was expanded upon and popularised by Graves (19th century) and others, leading ultimately to pride of place for the Triple Goddess in neopaganism (20th century), and later popularised again by certain elements within the feminist movement (late 20th century).
Ultimately, we don't have to restrict material to only one article. I doubt that the US civil war is left out altogether from the article on the US, just because it has its own article. ;)
I think Fuzzypeg's main concern is ensuring that Wikipedia documents the scholarship regarding pre-19th century triplicate goddesses in Europe.

I'm very sceptical of such purported discoveries. I mean, 8,000 kilometers (about 5,300 miles) is a lot of mileage for only three and a half years. I can't think of an expedition that would compare (didn't Poyarkov travel a few thousand miles in about the same time period?). Pyanda reminds me of Juan de Fuca: someone who commanded an expedition that supposedly accomplished quite a bit by a person that actually existed, but was recorded years after the fact (Fuca's three decades to Pyanda's century), with little or no primary documents supporting any of the discoveries.

I can't quite agree with the philosophy.  I think """"announce on the noticeboards,"""" and then you can talk to people like a normal human with normal conversation on IRC, if you're going to be there anyway.  Fundamentally, though, IRC is not part of Wikipedia: it's part of Freenode.  Wikipedia's rules are suspended there, including keeping a history, open editing, etc.  Therefore, if you announce first on IRC, you have, effectively, not announced at all.  I've tried to avoid taking such a draconian line, but that is the actual line.  In the meantime, knowing that people will say things as soon as they notice them, and, if they're on IRC at the time, they'll say it first there, the biggest thing is that every IRC user needs to know that whatever is said there simply hasn't been said at all, as far as Wikipedia is concerned.
My talk page should be mysterious to anyone who hasn't seen the logs of en.administrators.irc from Christmas Eve.  For myself I will say this much: I don't get actually angry very often, and when I read those logs I was enraged.  That should say something.  No doubt that argument doesn't look helpful, but I'm willing to go through it and look bad, if necessary, to get people to stop sniping from behind a screen.  If they want to denigrate me, want to spend time characterizing """"idiots who complain,"""" then they should do so where they have to be subject to the same """"assume good faith"""" and """"civility"""" and """"no personal attacks"""" rules that they have blocked people for (repeatedly).

I am posting this part here has it is systematically removed from the main article page. It seems that the communist collaborators and ignorance will prevail over what is the TRUTH and what is obvious.  

The Unknown President
The population of Angola don't know who Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos is. In this respect Angolan intellectuals, Angolan parliamentarians such as Dr Makuta Nkondo  http://angodenuncias.com/denuncias/?p=638  and International Human Rights Activist have denounced this issue. In this regard the Angolan Raper """"Brigadeiro 10 Pacotes"""" issued a video music stating that in Luanda and in Angola no one knows who Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos, and in the neighbourhoods where he supposedly grew up no body know him either    

The Angolan music artists known as """"Tribo Sul"""" issued a rap music track stating that Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos is not Angolan, which is a open secret in Angola.    We therefore call for common sense and request that the misleading information portraying Mr. Jose Eduardo dos Santos as Born in Luanda etc... as total fabrication and of bad taste, and misleading.

JayW - Predators do not scrutinize the internet in the hopes of tracking some kid who foolishly posted their name to Wikipedia. It simply doesn't happen. It doesn't happy here, nor does it happen anywhere else; and I would be happy to concede to anyone who proves otherwise, though I very much doubt that will happen. I whole-heartedly believe the situation this policy is designed to protect against is a terrible myth which, by distracting money, time and effort from actual issues, facilitates the sexual abuse of children.

On the other hand, some predators do use the chat services to anonymously groom children. This situation, while I doubt it would happen in such an incovenient environment, might deserve a policy.

..so, does this policy solve anything, as it stands? No - it doesn't prevent children from stating their age. Instead, it focuses on irrelevant information, like their street address and real name, which the predator can acquire privately once he has located the child's online contact information. Since many people use the same username across all the interwebs, this probably wouldn't be difficult.

The only solution, so far as I can see, is to police kids who mention their age. Any other policy is, to say the least, completely useless. Out,

It seems to me, to use a Christian metaphor, that you cast the first stone.  Basically my attitude here is that it is not only good men who should be identified as Christians.  If someone self-identifies as a train enthusiast that is good enough for me.  If there is a Wikipedia category for train enthusiasts then he should be included.  The category is for """"train enthusiasts"""" not """"good train enthusiasts"""".  We have no need to examine the purity of his enthusiasm.   

Besides, you are on a slippery slope.  In one Western democracy yesterday it was announced that more than 180,000 abortions happened last year.  That country is run by one who identifies himself very publicly as a Christian.  But he never speaks out against abortion.  He also took his country to war on false pretenses (he deliberately told lies) and in that war 20,000 innocent civilians have died who would not have died if there had been no war.  Using your argument Tony Blair cannot be identified as a Christian.   

But I do not want to use your argument.  Nor do I think we should.  (But even if we use your argument we cannot see into Tariq Aziz's soul.)  That you (presumably another Christian) re-act with distaste that Aziz belongs to the same club is not the point.

 External links on ballet 

Hello! External links are often taken as a """"For further reading"""" section, and as such, should complement the article, adding information we could not. As for ballet terminology, Wikipedia has a Glossary of ballet, and as we are working to create free content, it is more beneficial for us to create a better repository of terms and their meanings than to link to a copyrighted collection. Similarly, we shouldn't be linking to content which we should have, or which is only marginally related (physics of all dance is only marginally related to ballet). However, if you meant to reference a section, there's a different method of going about this documented at Wikipedia:Citing sources. The links used would be contained in a ==References== section, and it'd especially help if you could indicate which facts were verified and which weren't.

77edd59733b7d224,"Liver Disorders
The liver is the second largest organ in your body and is located under your rib cage on the right side. It weighs about three pounds and is shaped like a football that is flat on one side. The liver performs many jobs in your body. It processes what you eat and drink into energy and nutrients your body can use. The liver also removes harmful substances from your blood. How does a healthy diet help the liver? Eating a healthy diet helps the liver to do its functions well and to do them for a long time.  Eating an unhealthy diet can lead to liver disease. For example, a person who eats a lot of fatty foods is at higher risk of being overweight and having non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. For people who have liver disease, eating a healthy diet makes it easier for the liver to do its jobs and can help repair some liver damage. An unhealthy diet can make the liver work very hard and can cause more damage to it. What does a healthy diet include? •Eating foods from all the food groups: grains, proteins, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and fats •Eating foods that have a lot of fiber such as fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grain breads, rice and cereals Are there diet changes for those with liver disease? It is important for people with liver disease to maintain a healthy weight by eating a balanced diet with foods from all food groups. Also, •Do not eat uncooked shellfish such as oysters and clams •Limit eating foods that have a lot of sugar or salt Liver Diseases and Diet Some liver diseases have specific diet recommendations: Bile Duct Disease Bile is a liquid made in the liver that helps break down fats in the small intestine. Bile duct disease keeps bile from flowing to the small intestine. Diet Recommendations: • Use fat substitutes • Use kernel oil (i.e. canola, olive, corn, sunflower, peanut, flax seed oils) because it needs less bile to break down fats than other types of oil Cirrhosis Cirrhosis is the scarring and hardening of the liver. Diet Recommendations: •Limit salt and foods that contain a lot of salt •Talk to your doctor about how much protein to have in your diet Fatty Liver Disease Fatty liver disease is the build up of fat in liver cells. Diet Recommendations: •Limit foods that are high in calories •Eat foods that have fiber Hemochromatosis Hemochromatosis is the build up of iron in the liver. Diet Recommendations: •Do not eat foods that have iron •Do not use iron pots and pans •Do not take pills with iron •Do not eat uncooked shellfish Hepatitis C Hepatitis C is a disease of the liver caused by the hepatitis C virus. Diet Recommendations: •Limit foods that have a lot of iron •Do not use iron pots and pans •Limit salt and foods that contain a lot of salt Wilson Disease Wilson disease is the build up of copper in the body. Diet Recommendations: •Limit foods that have copper such as chocolate, nuts, shellfish and mushrooms • Do not use copper pots •Limit eating fatty foodskawaljeet bhinder

 Proposed move 

Rename article as Manchester United 0–1 Arsenal (20 October 1990) and keep flags in teamsheets. The article is about the match and the current title sensationalises one incident, though that incident has made the match notable.

I originally raised this proposal on WP:FOOTY but according to WP:BRD I should raise it here as I am seeking consensus, although I do apparently have the right per WP:BOLD to go ahead and complete the move immediately. The objections to flags seem to centre on a view that the article is, as the title would suggest, about a brawl. But, as I've pointed out above, the article is about the match and I think it should be retitled to comply with other similar match reports in the First Division Matches category. I'll abide by BRD here and leave this a week. If no objections then, I'll go ahead and move the article. Thanks.

I'm not sure and will think about it. , I'm doubt anything could be written about the SNPU that we couldn't fit into the Svoboda article, and so I tend to agree with you.

I'm guessing you'd disagree with this.

Nevertheless, we might all agree that far-right politics are in flux right now in Ukraine, and I wouldn't be surprised if many go the most far-right elements around Svoboda are now attracted to Right Sector.

Pop. (1900) 267,808; area, 6ooo sq. m. The strategic importance of this territory was recognized by the Romans, who defended it on the south by Trajans Wall, a double rampart, drawn from Constantza, on the Black Sea, to the Danube. In later times, it was utilized by Russians and Turks, as in the wars of 1828, 1854 and 1878, when it was finally wrested from Turkey. By the treaty of Berlin, in 1878, the Russians rewarded their Rumanian allies with this land of mountains, fens and barren steppes, peopled by Turks, Bulgarians, Tatars, Jews and other aliens; while, to add to the indignation of Rumania, they annexed instead the fertile country of Bessarabia, largely inhabited by Rumans. After 1880, however, the steady decrease of aliens, and,the development of the Black Sea ports, rendered the Dobrudja a source of prosperity to Rumania.",0,0,0,0,0,0

A broken chair is not a chair
A broken chord is not a chord.
An inverted pendulum is not a pendulum. Never leave out the the """"inverted"""" in """"inverted pendulum"""".

The problem with small wheeels and no castor is that the rider had to ride a combined inverted pendulum with gyroscopic forces that inhibit steering,  and then feed back into """"speed wobble"""" ..instability at speed.

So riding slowly, one can ride the inverted pendulum .   When riding the penny farthing, one had to slow down  to inverted pendulum speeds to turn, and then one had to be a master at inverted pendulum riding to achieve the turn.

Attempting to overcome gyrscopic force of the penny farthing front wheel while moving at speed was not possible, as the small and lightly loaded rear wheel would not grip and so would not provide enough torque. The small wheel would bounce along and provide very little torque.

The penny farthing got the large front wheel because the older castor deficient design did not have signficant castor, and were hard to pedal as the pedal 'plane' rotated compared to the rider (a real pain  in the legs !) 

The safety bike gave the much more leg friendly pedal arrangement , plus the castor on the front  wheel removed the problems with turning ,  stability at speed and feed back to the rider. The better pedal arrangement of the safety bike gave the rider better  ability to do the """"inverted pendulum"""" control at slow speeds.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Shmede 

Shmede, also known as RW, Schememememede or Romeo Whiskey, is a very competitive chap, who tends to frequently cheat at snooker so he can brag to his fellow friends about how good he is at the sport. His most familiar way of doing this involves returning reds to the table that have already been potted. Another canny trick of his is adding more points than he should onto his score, whilst adding less than he should to opponents. He also has a tendency to say he hit a particular ball when it was obvious he did not. At times, Richard can also be mistaken for Nelson Mandela.

He regards himself as a rather specialist aggressive opening batsman when playing cricket, and together with his slow left arm ‘throws’, he is one whack tack and cack cricketer. Richard’s wicket taking ability is particularly admirable, though apart from claiming the wicket of Simon ‘The Don’ Yates, he generally gets creamed all over the park.

Other sports he attempts to play include football, where, over an illustrious playing career, he has inherited a number of enemies, none of which hate him as much as the Sun, as particularly in the summer months, he can be seen rather red as the Sun is attracted to him. Rumour has it, that this sunburn is the reason why his legs contain very little hair.

His attitude throughout all sports is hated by most, as he is accustomed to arguing with most of his fellow players, including ones on his own side!

RW quotes:
Shouts ‘J*ggaboo’ as loud as possible in Rileys
‘Ya scran head’
‘Come back in 5 years’
‘Get a haircut’
'Doooooooooou like smack, doooooooooou like crack, then u will a love my new smack n a crack party bag. It has a smack and a plerrrrrrrrnty of crack. U can a steal ur friends car radio to pay for it' 
'R8 yunes'
'He's done him'
After hitting the wrong ball at snooker 'FOUL?! What you mean foul?! Dint you see I hit the red first, it was so obvious'
'Pre buzz', 'Rich has just sent a nudge', 'Buzz', 'Pre post buzz', 'Post buzz'
'Terina! Chips'
'Costootipoosmesh'
'I did dobin in 12 yesterday......first hole'
(When asked if the bat is knocked in) 'No its not tin' Then asked again... 'No its not tin, probably allumnium or something'
(When wearing velcro trainers) 'Hold this while I tie me shoe laces'
'Tight' followed closely by 'us bramble'
'Half the school fancies me!......just the wrong half'

In conclusion, Shmede can be simply summed up as a towel.

 Shmede and  at Rileys 

Quite frequently, usually by RWs arrangement, a trip to Rileys is organised for a few frames of snooker featuring RW and RB. Originally set for one o'clock, the meet time at 'Brownie's corner' has recently been moved forward to avoid both parties waiting after lunch has been completed. The meet time at present is around 1220. RB often wears what RW describes as 'his lucky top' which features a dragon on the front. RW's lucky chain was removed after he lost nine frames in a row.

To alert RB of his imminent arrival, RW pranks him numerous times along his journey from his home to the corner. These pranks are located at the following points:

When he sets off from his home,
At SPAR, where he picks up his, now accustomed, 'Spearmint Extra',
When he sees 'the corner',
Upon arrival to 'the corner'.

The journey down to Rileys is now via Hollis Lane as a maze has been erected on Horns Bridge Island. Upon arrival, RB picks the usual table 10, table 13 if 10 is not available, whilst RW visits the toilet and orders his Coke with one ice cube, the price of which is extortionate, and a tap water. The reasoning behind the one ice cube is that this is sufficient ice to cool the drink to an enjoyable temperature and yet not dilute the coke enough to affect its taste (noting that the room temperature of Rileys is at least a full three degrees above the standard 20-21 degrees and this hence means that should the generic four ice cubes be placed into the drink, they would melt at a particularly fast rate, diluting the cola even quicker).

Play usually consists of three frames, lasting approximately an hour and a half, although if RB wins the first two frames, RW is more than likely to concede. When pla",0,0,0,0,0,0

That would be pretty odd for those declassified documents to mention a movie that was created after the events for which both the movie and the documents do related about. The declassified documents were not synthesized for the movie, unless you want to prove a conspiracy on the synthesis (very odd).

He's alienated the entire right-wing media community, too, by suing just about everyone; after his latest lawsuit against the Washington Times, he's never going to get a job again.

Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. Thank you for your contributions.

Currently, you are editing without a username. You can continue to do so, as you are not required to log in to Wikipedia to read and edit articles; however, logging in will result in a username being shown instead of your IP address (yours is ). Logging in does not require any personal details. There are many other benefits for logging in to Wikipedia. For now, if you are stuck, you can type {{helpme}} on this page and an experienced Wikipedian will be around to answer any questions you may have.

Please note these points:

 Please respect others' copyrights; do not copy and paste the contents from webpages directly.
 Please use a neutral point of view when editing articles; this is possibly the most important Wikipedia policy.
 If you are testing, please use the Sandbox to do so. 
 Do not add unreasonable contents into any articles, such as: copyrighted text, advertisement messages, and text that is not related to an article's subject. Both adding such unreasonable information and editing articles maliciously are considered vandalism.

User:TTN decided it would be best to merge the lists into the main article and split Smithy Gang into those articles. I recently merged Smithy Gang into the list of chatacters by removing the non-notable characters, and I have asserted that a cameo section in the list of characters is valid, per Wikipedia:Trivia sections and Wikipedia:Handling trivia that uses Alex Trebek#Cameos as a good example. I have suggested that we rename the articles per Wikipedia:Requested moves#Requesting potentially controversial moves to something along the lines of Characters of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars and World of Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars or Mushroom Kingdom (Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars) just like Characters of Final Fantasy VIII and World of Final Fantasy VI or Gaia (Final Fantasy VII). I believe if these articles are to evolve beyond a non-notable list, they should be renamed. For example, List of Final Fantasy VII locations was merged into Gaia (Final Fantasy VII), because a World article is notable, but a simple list of locations is not. That is why there are other secions of the article to make it a World article. It simply has not been renamed yet.

TTN believes the citations in the development and reception sections of the list of locations, books and magazines, are trivial sources. When I added that the 3D perspective of the game is reminicent of Equinox to the main article, TTN removed it since my souce was """"the opinions of the Nintendo Power player's guide writers"""". Although it was actually Nintendo Power magazine, I do believe a magazine is a reliable source, and I gave a page from Next Generation Magazine which also said the same thing. In addition, I was surprized that TTN said that it was from the players guide, since he claims to own the players guide for the game. He has not verified this, since I asked him for citations in May, """"Could you look in the back of the Player's Guide and tell me what “types” of … Magic? I forgot what they call it in the game … well, anyways, what types of Special Attack or whatever it is (actually, could you find out what it's called?) there are? I remember some vaguely when I owned the guide like “Fire”, “Jump”, “Electricity?”, etc. Could you provide a citation, like the page number with a quote in context?"""" TTN replied that he was going to """"get to it"""" (User talk:TTN/Archive 5#List of locations in Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars). TTN claims the player's guide is """"at the bottom of a box that's behind at least five others in a cramped space"""". Seeing that TTN did not recognize that the page was not from the player's guide when I provided a scan of the page in question from Nintendo Power shocked me. However, I have continued to assume good faith by not questioning TTN's honesty.

Per Wikipedia:Consensus#Consensus can change, I have offered five different reasonable, temporary compromises that might integrate my idea with TTN's.
Go over the list of characters so we can delete non–notable characters 
Rename the articles by following the steps at Wikipedia:Requested moves#Requesting potentially controversial moves. 
Cut down the geography section list of locations by cutting it into the regional maps the adventures use when traveling from one to another. I can get pictures and write the fair use rationals, and someone can cut down the text that has no citation and does not allude to other media. 
Write the concept and creation and reception sections for the list of characters 
Write the concept and creation section for the main article

Ah, good catch, thank you, I was going based on the wording of a Times Union article that called it a State historical marker. If the list is indeed complete, please make the note of that invisible, as my note was. When I put a list article up for FL status is when I learned that we dont put statements like """"This is a list of..."""" or """"This is a complete list of..."""" The preferred way of doing an opening paragraph is to actually have a prose that describes and tells about the list rather than being straight forward about it. One I worked on and am proud of is List of incorporated places in New York's Capital District. Some very recently promoted FL's would be the most up-to-date on style preferences used on lists today- such as List of Oregon state symbols which is nearest in type/topic of list to yours that I know of, a search of other list articles of a similar topic and see what they do may be beneficial to this article and the writing of a prose lead. This is really skimpy and just a summary but reading Wikipedia:Featured list criteria could be beneficial if you havent already, or contacting someone who regularly does FL promotion reviews (I can provide you with some names if you want).
Separate from that, perhaps changing the title of the article to expand its scope to include any historical marker would be something you are interested in doing? A separate list article could always be done to cover them. If you're like me and enjoy researching and learning new things, expanding or making a new article for other types of historical markers could be fun and I for one would be very interested in seeing the work and learning more from the hard work that you've shown you do a good job at.

 Harry Potter is a Girl 

Dear Jimbo, I posted something here and it was archived because it was viewed that after a 3 day ban I was too expert in the use of WP:XXXX rules to be a newbie. It was said """"Will be archived: If you ever want to return, Jimbo can discuss this message (and your ADMINISTRATORS comment below) from his talk-page archives."""" I don't even know what that means. Here is my reply to the person that said that. And then the thing that was archived. The longer article was deleted off the page I put it on. I will glance back at my talk page to see if you have anything to say on this matter. If not I understand that it is not your issue. I would though prefer if you looked at it since that was my point, that people in power beneath you seem to want to bite the newbie to the point that the newbie is leaving and not coming back. They even suggested that my issue was with the WP:3RR rule which was not the issue. As a newbie I didn't know about that, and learned my lesson. It was with the time on the talk page being attacked by a WP:GANG / WP:TAGTEAM which are supported by administrators. So the person who archived my comments of your talk page didn't even get the point. Once I was told of the WP:3RR rule I never even touched the article again. Anyway hopefully you will actually read this before someone else finds a WP:XXXX rule as an excuse to delete it. 86.93.139.223  

So you understand, I had 3 days of a block to read the many WP:XXXX that were thrown at me, to then understand them. So while it might be hard for you to believe that someone can read in 3 days a bunch of WP:XXXX rules, it is not impossible. Actually I didn't have to read many, just the ones that were used against me to have me blocked. As I found, they were being totally misquoted against me. So yeah, you might find it hard to believe, you might also want to go to the Alkaline Diet article and look at how many people said exactly the same thing as I did in the past on the article. Is that hard to believe? Don't bother answering, just know that you might want to look at the history and deal with it. I don't understand why this was taken off Jimbo Wales' page by someone other than him with a note hard to believe. Isn't that his choice? Yes I would like him to discuss it with me. As I put it on his page with the express comment that the people (like you) who are in between him and me are the problem. So you making a personal judgement that someone can't read a few Wiki WP:XXXX rules in 3 days gives you the right to ignore my very detailed comments. Sorry but this is exactly the reason I contacted Jimbo and not you. Maximus. 86.93.139.223 (talk)  86.93.139.223

I can't know what is and what is not of interest to you, and following WP:BOLD I am making my statement and you can decide what to do next. I have put it here as I wanted you to know of my experience here at Wikipedia and how after a few days due to repeated WP:BITE I am leaving Wikipedia editing never to return. Because the people between you and me are the problem I thought to go straight to the top. Sometimes the people at the top don't get told what is going on below them. Anyway thanks for Wikipedia.

The net effect is that you deleted a bunch of content, plus which there is more to say about each individual rate (construction particulars for instance), plus it doesn't work with the categorization system.

In the case of the RN rates, all have much to say about them - rationale, evolution, employment, plus a picture or two so we can see what they looked like. This article should be about the system as a whole (who introduced it and why? When did it go out of use? How did it compare to other nations' systems?) - once you have adequate treatment of all that, plus the two screenfuls with two representative pictures per rate, that's a pretty hefty article, no longer easy for reader to get the basic definition of """"third-rate"""".

 POV/inaccurate paragraph 

The Vlachs did not pass the same process of forcible Romanization of alphabet or vocabulary as the Romanians in Romania

Forcible? Nobody forced anyone to change the words one uses. There were French borrowings, but this was done also by Bulgarians and Russians, for example. There was an idea in 19th century to eliminate Slavic words from Romanian and it was labeled as absurd.

and they usually say that they are descendants of Romanized Moesians, compared to the Romanized Gheto-Dacians in Romania. The fact is that both Moesians and Gheto-Dacians were the Thracian tribes, so the substrate was not so different. 

Yes, most linguists think that Moesians and Geto-Dacians spoke the same language, labeled by some """"Daco-Moesian"""", but that's off-topic here. Linking modern people to ancient peoples is nonsense. It's absurd to say that some are descendants from """"Geto-Dacians"""" and others from the """"Moesians"""".

Anyway, the Romanians of Wallachia and Vlachs of Serbia speak the same language! I mean even the same dialect! The southern """"Wallachian"""" dialect is what became standard Romanian language. 

Some Vlachs usually emphasize that the difference between them and Romanians """"are the same as the difference between the Serbs and Bulgarians"""".

http://fornvannen.se/pdf/1980talet/1983_021.pdf
This article was edited and approved by the previous editor of Fornvännen Fil Dr Jan-Peder Lamm 
Fornvännen is a highly reputable magazine
Göran H. wrote the article in 1982.  Jan-Peder Lamm edited the article but  suggested that Göran H. should include a comparison with Stonehenge. Therefore did J-P L supply Göran H. with archaeological history about Stonehenge. Göran H. re-wrote the article with comparison with Stonhenge and the article was published in 1983.

Jan-Peder Lamm, born 27 October 1935, is a Swedish archaeologist. He received his PhD in 1973 from the University of Stockholm for a dissertation about a Migration Period elite cemetery near Drottningholm.
Lamm taught archaeology at the University of Stockholm in the 1970s and then worked until retirement as Head Curator for the Swedish Iron Age at the Museum of National Antiquities in Stockholm. He is a member of the editorial board behind the journal Fornvännen and has taken active part in the Helgö project since the 1960s.
Fornvännen (print: ISSN 0015-7813, online: ISSN 1404-9430) is a Swedish academic journal in the fields of archaeology and Medieval art. It is published quarterly by the Royal Swedish Academy of Letters in Stockholm, Sweden. The journal's contributions are written in the Scandinavian languages, English, or German with summaries in English. Fornvännen has the alternate title Journal of Swedish Antiquarian Research. The editor in chief is Lars Larsson.
Fornvännen began publication in 1906 when it replaced two earlier journals, Svenska Fornminnesföreningens Tidskrift and Vitterhetsakademiens Månadsblad. Early contributors included noted archaeologists Oscar Montelius and Hans Hildebrand.[1] Since 2000 it has an online version, since 2007 its first 100 annual volumes have been available on-line, and since 2009 Fornvännen is published as a delayed open-access journal with the online version of each issue appearing six months after the paper version.
Fornvännen is an ERIH category B journal. According to Ulrich's, it is indexed in Anthropological Index Online, Anthropological Literature, British & Irish Archaeological Bibliography (Online Edition), Nordic Archaeological Abstracts, and FRANCIS. It was previously also indexed in Internationale Bibliographie der Rezensionen Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaftlicher Literatur and Linguistic Bibliography.[2]

I'm archiving this section because the pettiness simply is non-productive.  Let's try to figure out something that we can do constructively with these articles.  An A7 CSD was clearly wrong, but let's face it, most of these articles deserve to die.  The question is how to handle this constructively, which is what is going on above.  Let's stop quibbling over the rules and work towards getting something constructive done.-' NO! I'm Spartacus! 

Steve, I can tell you one way which will not work for the articlesand that is to do as you have done, and deleted some of them as G4, as if the AfD had closed the way you wanted it, not as keep. And the many you deleted (as did Orderinchaos) as dg-a7, non-notable person, in total defiance of WP:CSDA7.    The closer told you the right waynominate for deletion the ones you want to, individually.   I've asked you both on your talk page to restore them.  Sarah, can you explain to them about the inadvisability of outright   defiance of Wikipedia policy?  After we get this cleanup up, I'll talk a little about proper merging/redirect. As you may guess, I shall almost certainly to revert any redirects or merges except with consensus for each article. That does not mean I might not agree to some , most, or even all of them if procedure is followed properly. '  
I would suggest that threatening the community to edit war against it when it is trying to find a solution to a problem and work through differing and even opposing points of view to mutual satisfaction, is neither a wise nor an advisable course of action. Your behaviour at the past AfD is already under scrutiny - you openly defied policy in ways I have never actually seen from an admin who managed to keep his bit thereafter. VirtualSteve and myself closed articles which had been recreated against consensus, the recent AfD offered no opinion on any individual article and was a reaction to the mass nom (which, while I supported, I did not initiate nor did I think it was the absolute best way to resolve the situation - though as it has gotten the right people talking to each other, may yet result in progress). A bit of cooperation rather than snarky threats to disrupt and offline abuse of contributors would go a long way from you, DGG. Orderinchaos 
No, but I can explain to you about the inadvisability of outright defiance of Wikipedia's policy on wheel and edit warring. The edit war policy states """"Edit warring is the confrontational, combative, non-productive use of editing and reverting to try to win, manipulate, or stall a content dispute."""" Strangely enough that sounds an awful lot like what you're threatening to do. You've certainly got a check on the """"confrontational"""", """"combative"""" and """"non-productive"""" criteria. Redirecting and merging are editorial decisions which can be performed in the usual manner and the threat to revert attempts to do so is truly stunning. As is the arrogance implicit in the statement that you'll return to lecture us poor shmoes on how to do merges and redirects the """"proper"""" way. 8| You don't have any more authority here than any one of us and your behaviour regarding this subject has been outrageous and disruptive. I haven't had anything to do with you before this so I don't know if this is an aberration or if it is how you usually behave and approach dealing with other editors and fellow admins but if it is, as emails I've received since my email to the mailing list would suggest, there are serious concerns about your behaviour that will need to be addressed. As a co- (by 5?!) Vice President of the Wikimedia NY sub-chapter you really ought to be setting a far better example and not acting like an arrogant bully-boy, standing over people who are discussing ways to resolve this, and threatening to revert good faith attempts to clean up a mess, which even you yourself have said needs to be cleaned up. You really should know better and I'm appalled by your behaviour. Sarah 
I've also received some interesting info in recent days about unrelated disputes, and have made the relevant authorities aware. The odd bit is that there isn't even a dispute here as such between the different active, editing parties here - merely differing positions on notability which can actually be negotiated. The editors who come to this as fans have said they are - 1. willing to work with us; 2. willing to help with content.

There is also such a thing as qualitative, that is spirit of the law, rather than letter of the law that you seem to be incapable of understanding.  
As I stated, I reverted because I realized that I was in the 'Crucifixion in art' section and that my statement didn't wholly apply.  I reverted because there is important art scattered among Manga, and the movies and 30 minute toy commercials of Anime. If this had been the 'crucifixion' article I would have left my statement in.  Having said that, I will restate my objections to that particular image.  Sailor Moon, the Comic, is an important and potentially relevant piece of art.  It is the Wonder Woman of Japanese Manga;  it is liberating to girls in an otherwise oppressive culture.  Sailor Moon, the Cartoon, exists only to sell plastic make-up cases and moon wands to 8-12 year olds.  Art requires that the Artist had something to say.  If you found an identical image from the comic, and some source that said that Naoko Takeuchi had some reason for it being there, I would have little objection.   As I said, there are other actually relevant and artistic crucifixions done in Anime and Manga, and I would have no objection to those being included either.  68.114.130.234",0,0,0,0,0,0

I've just made another update adding more details I was too tired to add last time.  The article is starting to come together, and I plan to begin working on filling in the {Winners} tables with the 1979-1995 winners.  I'm still not really convinced the page even needs the """"Winners"""" tables, since the ceremony is equally dedicated to awarding television actors (if not more so) and the categories have changed so much over the years it would be impossible to efficiently list all the winners in the various categories that have popped up and disappeared over the years: Dramatic Films, Comedy Films, Action-Adventure Films, and then the """"splitting"""" of categories into age groups, etc. It gets pretty convoluted, so I think it might be a better idea to use the """"Winners"""" section to mention some of the notable former child stars who were nominated for or won a Young Artist Award and then went on to receive  acclaim as adults, but for now I think the tables that are on the page should at least be complete, so I'll be working on that next.

Purrum, get the story accurate rather than make more false allegations about Opas. You are trying to confuse the """"facts"""", as per usual. Truth is, Opas wrote many articles, which have always clearly stated the """"facts"""" - that only one single shot was heard by all persons and prison officer Paterson testified he fired one single shot. Also, prison officer Pascoe admitted on national television in 1986 (19 years after Ryan was hanged) that he fired a shot from tower 3, which might have killed Hodson. Pascoe stated that he was a young scared coward at the time for keeping quiet as he didn't want to get into trouble and lose his job. Hence, there has been much speculation over the decades of where the fatal shot was fired from, and by whom. The """"fact"""" remains that the police and prosecution failed, for whatever reason, to provide a shred of scientific forensic evidence, which would have proven beyond reasonable doubt who's rifle fired the fatal shot. Nobody's rifle was ever tested. There were lots of prison officers with lots of rifles at the time everyone heard one single shot. Not one single rifle, including Ryan's rifle, was tested for evidence. This is a """"fact"""".

Once again, I'll chalk this up to poor communications, rather than any malice on your part.

After you said """"Why should I listen to you anyway"""" it was pretty clear you didn't want me to answer you, so others stepped in; now you're blaming me for your behavior and the other people responses, and calling me a bully?

I'm justifiably angry!

 Questionable """"Unresolved Disruptive Technologies"""" 

Some of the examples of """"unresolved"""" technologies promoted as disruptive cannot honestly be considered """"unresolved"""".  The most glaring of these is """"e-commerce vs. physical shops"""".  It is absolutely clear that both e-commerce and physical shops are completely entrenched in their own respective niches, and while there is a lot of competition between them in some areas, the idea that either one could entirely supplant and eliminate the other in the forseeable future* is lunacy.  Similar arguments apply to """"free / open-source vs. proprietary software"""" and """"Internet Video on Demand and IPTV vs. Advertising supported broadcast and cable television"""".

The examples of """"Music downloads and File sharing vs. compact discs"""", """"ebooks vs. paper books"""", and """"VoIP (and VoIP over 802.11) vs. traditional telephone and mobile phone service"""" are much better examples of """"unresolved"""" potentially disruptive technologies.

Welcome!

Hi, and welcome to Wikipedia. I'm from WikiProject Pakistan. We're a group of editors working to improve Wikipedia's coverage of Pakistan.

There are a variety of interesting things to do within the project; you're free to participate however much—or little—you like:

 You can give your input at project's main discussion page and keep it on your watchlist: Wikipedia talk:Notice board for Pakistan-related topics.
 You can !vote and work on saving articles that are up for deletion at Wikipedia:WikiProject Deletion sorting/Pakistan.
 Want to know how good our articles are?  The assessment department is working on rating the quality of every Pakistan article in Wikipedia.
 Can you code?  The automation department uses automated and semi-automated methods to perform batch tasks that would be tedious to do manually.
 Please participate in any of our descendant workgroups that might interest you.
Add your name in the members at Wikipedia:WikiProject Pakistan/Members. There's also a  user box template which you can put on your user page to identify yourself as a member:

 Cadaver sanguisugus 

Hi, do you have a scholarly source for the term """"cadaver sanguisugus"""" having been used at least once by William de Newburgh or anyone else? I notice that there are a lot of Google hits on vampire forums etc., but according to this paper, only the word """"sanguisuga"""" occurs, and it is translated by historian James Carley as """"a leech"""". In the Medieval sourcebook edition of Newburgh, the sentence reads """"The young men, however, spurred on by wrath, feared not, and inflicted a wound upon the senseless carcass, out of which incontinently flowed such a stream of blood, that it might have been taken for a leech filled with the blood of many persons.""""

No point in wasting other editors time, if the images have absolutely no chance of being allowed to stay in the end.  Every image above said that it was taken from somewhere, and that's generally not allowed.  There are some specific exceptions, but I don't see them applying.  You should read the Copyright FAQ, specifically section 1.1 and 4.  If you took something from somewhere and modified it, it would count as a derivative work.  The copyright for the original still applies in that case, so it will not be allowed to remain here.

 As for using pictures created by your father, I think most people will accept if you claimed to have his permission (I think there is a more formal way to register the permission, but I wouldn't bother).  You should know, though, that the license tag you selected (public domain) allows anyone in the world to do anything they want with it.  Essentially, you're releasing the copyright.  That's good for Wikipedia, but if you think the picture is of great quality, you may wish to retain the copyright and instead license it with one of the GFDL licenses, which are still accepted on Wikipedia.  If this is something you want to do, I'll be happy to guide you through selecting an appropriate license for your needs.

 In short, it seems you are not entirely familiar with how copyrights work.  Even with a link back to the source, you can't just take the image and use it here.  There are some exceptions that can allow the use of non-free materials, such as fair use (section 5 in the FAQ), but then it would require re-tagging and a detailed fair use rationale.  It doesn't look like any of the remaining images can't conceivably be replaced by free alternatives, and none of them are absolutely essential to the articles they're used in.  Hence, you'll have a hard time getting the fair use rationale accepted.",0,0,0,0,0,0

 My response to Mr Nathanael ,corcerning his astrological beliefs along with his biased and bossy behavior in wikipedia

The problem with Mr Nathanael is that loves to act like a self proclaimed Administrator here in wikipedia and deleting even reliable sources from other members that contradict his own personal beliefs (or his friends) from his picked sources and i am not talking only about deleting Astrology-online but other sources too that i citated and Mr Nathanael try to delete them with some unjustified cheap excuse.... 

Here is one example below of Mr Nathanael bossy behavior here in wikipedia from the Scorpio History page when i contributed a reliable source from Kelli Fox (A professional Astrologer as i clearly pointed him with a url of her homepage)

 Sarsaparilla 

In brief, here's his history:
 He was involved in proposing (with Abd) something called Delegable Proxy.  I wasn't involved in that, but I gather that his contributions were perceived as disruptive and he was blocked indefinitely.
 He used sockpuppets to evade this block.
 Eventually, his block was lifted, and he resumed editing openly as User:Obuibo Mbstpo.
 Many of his edits with this account were perceived as very annoying - he opposed all deletion, for example, and would make significant changes to policy pages without advance discussion, citing WP:BOLD and WP:BRD).  He also proposed new policies that could only be described as """"bizarre"""", for example allowing people to treat Wikipedia like Myspace if they agreed to put Google ads on their user pages.  Some people wanted to re-block him for this; I continually argued against doing so.
 He created Obuibo Mbstpo, a hoax article about a fictitious Nigerian parliamentarian.  When confronted about this, he fabricated a source to defend the article.  He was blocked again.
 He used sockpuppets to evade this ban.
 He eventually took responsibility for the hoax article and fabricating the source.  Once he did this, I advocated - eventually successfully - for his unblock.
 Once unblocked, he created an article on the Easter bunny hotline a phone number which, while existent, was clearly non-notable.  He was blocked again as a result.  I stated that I considered this block unjustified, but that I wasn't going to exert any energy to get him unblocked, since I was pretty sure he'd created the Easter bunny article in bad faith.
 He used socks to evade his blocks.
 He expressed an interest in appealing his case to Arb Comm.  I told him that if he agreed to edit only the arbitration pages, I would unblock him to do so.  Moreover, I stated that I would advocate for a partial unbanning under those circumstances.  He responded to this by declining my offer and continuing to sockpuppet.
It's true that he's never actually been disruptive in parliamentary procedure articles, at least to my knowledge.  I don't care; he's clearly here primarily to disrupt, and the project needs him gone.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Is Brian really an atheist? 

In the recently aired episode, """"April in Quahog"""", Brian can be clearly observed praying some time after the news report leads the public to believe that a black hole is going to swallow the earth. Also, at the end of the episode, Brian leaves the house saying he made a deal with someone that now that the earth is spared he would go volunteer at the soup kitchen. Based on the context of the situation and Stewie's remark in the background that the 'someone' Brian made a deal with was God, this calls Brian's atheism into question and suggests that he has developed some closeted religious beliefs (though other evidence from previous episodes might lead one to suspect that they have been there all along). There are only two other explanations for this series of events that I can think of: One would be that one of the underlying ideas behind the episode is something to the tune of 'there are no atheists in foxholes', though this is unlikely because Brian can be seen following through with his promise which a person who had temporarily reverted to religion because of fear wouldn't do, let alone that any kind of conservative message is very unlike McFarlane. The other would be that McFarlane is somehow poking fun at peoples' work righteous attitude towards religion, however this is also unlikely because in order to understand the joke, an in depth understanding of what Christianity actually teaches would be required which most people (including McFarlane) likely do not posses.

Well thank you for at least stepping up and citing some kind of reasoning for what I consider unreasonable actions on the part of others Bob Rayner!

No original research?  Are you kidding me?  Years of research was reported (both failures and successes), that was also physically verified experimentally by over 20 others world-wide, and is cited on my original, and now archived (and now unalterable by me) open.org/davidc website, on both archive.go-here.com and archive.org in Europe.

The past updates on that archive collection details those years of experimental research, including the works of others on the subject around the world, beginning with the first physical verifications by James Hurl of Australia, and follows the story through to the last update before I gave up for a while out of exasperation, due to unrelenting stupidity and prejudice (don't confuse our religiously scientific dogma by citing facts).

The theory of operation I believe is clearly stated, and the """"flat earth"""" prejudice against the subject is apparent in the overall tone and presentation of the balance of the definition of """"Inertial_Propulsion"""".  A lone dissenting voice challenging the current dogma is how ALL of science progresses past the ignorance of yesteryears.

To disallow original research is to attempt to hold ALL of science to a stable state, and ignores the dynamic nature of the search for greater truths than we currently understand.

Science is NOT a BIBLE, and DOGMA is anathema to the entire process of research!

Should the games listing come out of the main page and instead go to somewhere like RPG/RPG Listings?
Well, there are also listings in the subgenre articles, so I think we should merge them.  07:28 Jan 16, 2003 (UTC)

I think the more useful distinction is between Role-playing games and Role-playing generally. I'm taking the latter from this page and making a new page just for the more general case.

Also note that I use """"role-playing"""" as the generic term more commonly linked to psychological uses because it is so cited in Webster's New World College Dictionary. Moreover, I am adopting the """"role-playing game"""" usage (hyphen between role and playing) in order to follow that convention and because it makes sense grammatically (hyphenate compound adjectives modifying a noun). 

However I am thinking that """"role-play game"""" follows common usage better than """"role-playing game."""" But I'm not going to redirect the page now, anyway (Dec. 26, 2001)  

No one I know of (and I know lots of gamers) says """"role-play game"""".  It's always """"role-playing game"""", and I am sure that's the most common usage.   

Not to sound like a nerd or anything, but White Wolf is not, strictly speaking, a role-playing game. They are a publisher. Their role-playing game universe, World of Darkness, encompasses between 5 and 12 or so (depending on how you count them) role-playing games... OK. I'm really not that much of a nerd... OK. Maybe just a bit.  10:39 Dec 6, 2002 (UTC)

Isn't Battletech more a table-top war game and not an RPG? I have never played it, but isn't there Mechwarrior, which is an RPG based on Battletech's world?  07:24 Jan 16, 2003 (UTC)

Battletech was purely wargame, then Mechwarrior was made to turn it into an RPG, however they are basically the same thing, Mechwarrior is like AD&Ds; Player Handbook and BattleTech rules are simply the rules for combat, battletech being more complex than AD&D.; Battletech is notable from other RPGs in that correctly played one's character is as mortal as all the enemies one fights, so usually you die. Its basically a wargame where the units have stats which change over the course of a campaign, and most people generally have the commander of their forces represent themselves, thus, an RPG and a wargame. Also its common for the GM or DM to be replaced by a classical referee and then the players, instead of playing as a team, go to war with each other. 

Battletech was a miniatures game, based on Japanese anime, in the """"mech""""  genre. Later a set of rules was developed that allowed one to play a mech pilot in an ongoing campaign. Battletech was published FASA, which is now out of business. Along with Battletech FASA also published games such as """"Behind Enemy Lines"""" (World War Two skirmish game), """"Shadowrun"""" (cyberpunk/'magic returns' roleplaying), and """"Earthdawn"""" (fantasy roleplaying). At present both Battletech and Earthdawn have found new publishers.

For a list of RPGs I recommend trying the Yahoo and Google directories You will find listings for literally hundreds of games. Have fun.

Finally, when I have it composed I will be uploading an essay on roleplaying games, and why they really aren't games at all. At least not in the traditional sense of a game as something with victory conditions and competition among the participants.

Hope this finds you all well. 15:14 Feb 9, 2003 (UTC)

Sounds interesting, but remember that Wikipedia tries to maintain a neutral point of view.  It may be better to simply provide a link to your essay.   15:43 Feb 9, 2003 (UTC)

Merriam-Webster's definition of game includes as its first entry activity engaged in for diversion or amusement and then equates it with play.

14:58, 21 September 2009 Kelly A. Siebecke (talk | contribs) (10,340 bytes) (the facts were there and JoyDiamond insists on replacing them, removing them, or exaggerating them - edit reverted) 
This just an example of the misrepresentation of the type of continued harassment I have been receiving from Kelly Siebecke.
I replaced parts of articles that were erroneous, removed undue repetition, I exaggerated nothing.
I received a warning this morning that I had been previously warned about removing anything from Kelly's talk page. This is simply untrue. Her only warning was not to TALK (what are talk pages for ?)
A little history: I am a senior citizen who is an acquaintance of Karel Bouley. My first edits were to change things I considered unkind and then all heck ensued as I was told I was not using an objective point of view. My mistake. After discussion with  Feral Druid and another editor, I apologized for my error and assured them  I could be objective and neutral. They accepted that.I am not a wide-eyed fan or close friend. We have a very intermittent working relationship. However, I am privy to the truth of his schedule, personal facts, his history and the details of the death of his partner, whom I also knew. I also participate in his chat room. 
In the chat room, I was warned that there was a room who ostensibly had a grudge against Karel and that may be in an issue. I didn't really take it seriously. As I mentioned I am an older woman with much experience in dealing with difficult people. So, I was not expecting any problems. FYI, I have a Master's degree in Medical Sociology, a Doctorate in divinity. In my B.A. studies I minored in Communication and problem resolution. 
In my observation of Karel's article, I began to notice subtle and not so subtle changes in his article that were making it increasingly negative, positive aspects were deleted even though properly referenced. I made what I considered objective and neutral edits. My edits were reversed and replaced with even more negativity. AS I fumbled my way thru Wiki I discovered the history page and the person of Kelly Siebeck. I checked with the person who had warned me and found it was indeed Kelly. He described it as a vendetta after she had been banned from chat. She denies this is not the issue and angrily claims she is not angry! Please read her  page and decide for yourself about this woman. The problem has escalated recently into personal attacks, removing positive facts and their references. She will tell you I am not good at references. She is right. Feral Druid has been very kind in helping me with those. I still have a lot to learn. BUT I will correct information that is an outright lie and/or demeaning to Karel. I have deleted several times her claim that one of his radio shows was once a week. It is a daily show and was properly reference until she deleted it. SO  now I am reported for excessive deleting of outright misrepresentation and lies!
I do not want to argue with this woman claims her knowledge is superior to mine. That is just ludicrous. I have 14 years of education and 40 years of experience of which she had no knowledge when she claimed she was just WAY more informed than I was. I would just like her to cease and desist and preferably be blocked from Karel's page. Go back to the original article and compare if you can. I will have NO reason to edit when Karel's page is cleaned up and stays that way. Karel has requested that it be locked. There is no reason to repeat he was fired at the beginning of too many sentences. She does that repeatedly. Yes, he was fired, Twice. No reason to repeat it over and over. Much of his colorful history and various talents have been deleted. It is sad. I tried writing her a nice ministerial letter to no avail. I am tired. I edit ONE article and am repeatedly attacked dismissed and insulted.  She is petty and without relent. AS the """"great"""" philosopher Rodney King said """"why can't everybody just be nice? ;-) I work with Karel. I know the good the bad and the ugly, and will record such as long it is truthful and factual.
I am sorry this dear woman a has a problem with Karel and myself. What started out as a relatively decent article has turned mean spirited and wildly inaccurate. Karel is controversial enough with someone adding to it. Please help. I am a nice lady with a little temper. My grandchildren think I am awesome. I am funny, I have something to contribute. I was Valedictorian at age 42. Work with me please. I thought if I could work with Karel I could work with anyone. I was wrong.

First frame of reference: Antiochus IV Epiphanes as per the Book of Daniel.

Given that many historians, critics, and many Jewish and Christian scholars believe that the Book of Daniel is about the events in Israel from the beginning of the Babylonian Captivity to the end of the Maccabean Revolt, they would say that the Old Testament reference is to Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the man who attacked the Temple in Jerusalem and defiled it by sacrificing a pig on the altar, erecting a statue of Zeus as himself in the temple, raiding the Temple treasury and minting coins saying """"Theos Epiphanes"""" (God manifest), etc.

In Revelation, John borrowed the """"Son of Perdition"""" concept from the prophecies of Daniel, relating them by language. He refers to """"the star that fell from heaven"""" by two names, one Greek, and the other Hebrew. The Greek name is """"Appolyon,"""" from the Greek root word """"apolumi."""" It refers to utter loss, eternal destruction, and disassociation."""" The Hebrew name is """"Abaddon,"""" from the Hebrew root word """"'abad,"""" which means the same thing as the Greek root word. In the Book of Daniel, the interpreter says that the eventual destiny of the """"great beast"""" is to be """"destroyed"""" ('abad), and given to the eternal flames (i.e. hell).

Second frame of reference: Judas Iscariot

In John , Jesus says that of all his disciples, none has been lost except the """"son of perdition"""". The New International Version translates the phrase as """"the one doomed to destruction.""""

There were actually two users supporting deletion (Spartaz and Peripitus).

 Hi there! Thank you for your querie about the Humanistic teachings of Nichiren Buddhism. Let me start by saying that the title """"Humanistic Buddhism"""" is rather sematically weak: because there are no 2 types of Buddhism: one Humanistic and another non-Humanistic. I think we should alter the title into """"Buddhist Humanism"""". If you trace the word Humanism you'll find various views: Christian Humanism, secular Humanism...etc... and adding the term """"Buddhist Humanism"""" is appropriate. 

 Secondly, the term Humanistic Buddhism or Buddhist Humanism, whether in China or Japan or the USA, is based on the Buddha's teachings - in particular the teachings of the Lotus Sutra. (The article mentions this clearly). The Lotus Sutra - of course - is not a private property of a certain temple or nation (Chinese, Japanese etc...) Buddhism of the Lotus Sutra is a universal teaching for all Humanity.

Historically, it was TienTai of China who placed the Lotus Sutra as the highest of the Buddha's teachings. Later it was introduced to Japan and the Tendai Sect emerged upholding the Lotus teachings, which was the ground for Nichiren, who appeared in 1222, to declare his teachings based solely on the Lotus Sutra. Currently, a 12 millions Samgha Nichiren Buddhist group (the Soka Gakkai International) is actively working for: """"Spreading Buddhist Humanism in the Community"""" http://www.sgi.org/about-us/members-stories/spreading-buddhist-humanism-in-the-community.html

 Nichiren Buddhism focuses on the Lotus Sutra: “Buddhist humanism:  It is a philosophical perspective that reflects the core spirit of the Lotus Sutra”
Buddhist Humanism: http://www.daisakuikeda.org/main/philos/buddhist/buddh-05.html

 I think it is more accurate and more professional to refer to Buddhism as either Theravada or Mahayana. In China or Japan, you have Buddhist schools which are either Theravada or Mahayana. There is no such thing as """"Chinese"""" Buddhism and """"Japanese"""" Buddhism. Using the term Chinese or Japanese Buddhism is plainly wrong. For example Zen has branches and temples in both Japan & China. It remains Zen. No need here for confusing """"passport"""" added to Buddhism. Nichiren Buddhism is found all over the world but mostly parcticed in Japan, this does not make it Japanese, but correctly: a Mahayana school based on the Lotus Sutra. It is even not logical to speak about Humanism and Humanity and in the same time restrict Buddhism to artificial national descriptions of  Chinese and Japanese terms. 

 Wikipedia articles must be impartial and must bring various views. Humanistic values of Buddhism cannot be patented to this temple or that priest only. All respect worthy people working to spread Buddhist Humanism must be acknowledged. I am doing research to include the participation of various Mahayana schools in the teachings of Humanism of the Buddha teachings which are for all Humanity. Thank you for your input and let's cooperate to improve the article.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

This article (in its current state) is weird. It looks like someone pushing an issue or their own advice or something. I can't explain it. Looks a little bit like an essay on agriculture in general. But the only information i think we need to keep from it which regards agricultural productivity is:

for economists: agricultural productivity is measuring production of an agricultural good + estimating its value on the market, which = an indication of its profit-making potential.

for farmers: the term agricultural productivity means first the ability (for themselves or their community) to survive on the agricultural goods they produce. [perhaps list here the agricultural products mentioned in the article which the community can use, e.g. food (crops, dairy & meat), hides, manure, etc]

the part about it being a better idea to produce a variety of products instead of just specialising in one product (eg crops) is interesting information, but i'm not sure it belongs here. Any ideas on how to incorporate it into this article, or perhaps another one?",0,0,0,0,0,0

__TOC__

Totoro and Shinto
I don't believe the section """"Totoro and Shinto"""" is necessary. Totoro has nothing to do with anything religious. Even though there appears shrines and a tree with a shimenawa, it doesn't mean that Totoro has shintoist themes because you can see shinto shrine everywhere in Japan. Regarding appearance of shrine as Shintoism is just a misunderstanding by foreigners who have little knowledge of the Japanese way of religion. Obake has nothing to do with shinto either. No Japanese people regard obake as a part of shinto. If you call Totoro religious, almost all Japanese anime and manga will be religious. Do you call Inuyasha religious just because Kagome lives in a shrine? Or do you call Yu Yu Hakusho religious because Yusuke became a ghost and there're many yokais in the show? Or do you say Shrek has Christian themes just because there's a church? Calling something shintoism just because it is traditional is nonsense. Even if Totoro seems to have shintoist themes to the westerners' eyes, it just means Totoro is a movie set in the Japanese countryside and it is nothing worthy of special mention.  

You may believe most Japanese people are shintoist, but it is not necessarily true. They go to shrine on New Year's Day not because they believe in shinto but simply beacuse it is Japanese tradition. The same thing can be said about the appearance of the shrine in Totoro. The appearance of shinto shrine or that of obake cannot be connected to shinto. Believe it or not, it is true that there's no Japanese word for """"shintoist"""" although there is the word for """"Buddhist"""", bukkyouto. In other words, Japanese people don't regard them something like """"shintoist"""". To Japanese, shinto is not something you believe in or you don't blieve in. There's no bible or dogma. Shinto is nothing like Christianity, Islam or Buddhism. It is even doubtful whether it is proper to say that shinto is a religion. 
Totoro is nothing religious. Repeat, the appearance of the shrine doesn't mean Totoro has shintoist themes. I must say that to see Totoro religious is only a biased viewpoint. If there're no dissenting opinions, I will erase the section """"Totoro and Shinto"""" on the 24 of April, a week after my first note on the issue.  

True, Totoro is not religious, but there are significant Shinto themes throughout the film. The Totoro are forest/nature spirits, the tree where they live is part of a shrine, and so on. Having Shinto themes does not mean Miyazaki was trying to get across some religious point. Rather, I imagine he was trying to evoke images of a lost past (as it is set in the 1950s) when things were simpler, and trying to get people to remember their roots and not forget their traditions. As you wrote yourself, Shinto is not so much a religion anymore (except to a very few), but more of a set of traditions with some religious elements. Totoro can have Shinto elements without being a religious film. I don't think anyone is arguing the film is religious. You're the only one who's said anything about that. I do find it odd how you reply to yourself above, and appear to be arguing with yourself.···? · Talk to Nihonjoe 

No, I didn't talk to myself. I wanted to say some more. That's all.  

Although I reverted the deletion of this section (see following thread), I have no familiarity with this topic and no opinion whether this section belongs in the article or not.  ☎ 

I agree with Michael Friedrich. All the spiritual creatures appearing in Totoro (totoro/troll, cat-bus, etc.) have as little resemblance to traditional Japanese/shinto spirits as monsters from Nausicaä in contrast to those from Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away that have more expressly Japanese looks and names. 

In either way, unless the author of the section have reliable sources to back up his interpretation of this film in there, it should be removed. A couple of sentence that cite McCarthy's article may stay, but the rest appears to be a product of original research.

One solid example of why that content can not stay. Your edit said: The story was unsubstantiated, with no presentation made of either tangible proof or any named sources. Yet the reference you provided to back that up is an article by Glazer himself that says: Several sources have told FOX Sports that Favre earlier this year phoned the Detroit Lions prior to their battle versus Favre's old team, the Green Bay Packers, and gave them a rundown of the nuances of what Green Bay does on offense. According to the sources, Favre actually spent over an hour on the phone with Lions coaches, who were connected with Favre by then-team president Matt Millen. That story is not """"unsubstantiated"""" and the use of anonymous sources is completely normal and accepted in journalism. Calling the story unsubstantiated is a violation of WP:BLP, and implying that it was incorrect because of the lack of """"named sources"""" is an arbitrary standard that violates WP:NPOV. In addition, in the third source you provide, Favre admits that he did have a conversation with the Detroit executive, and that """"Favre said former players and coaches exchange information all the time."""" That doesn't disprove anything Glazer said, and in some ways seems to support it. As I said above, if you reinsert that content, I will have to block you from editing.

Again, NK never existed as a region before 1920s. While Nagorno translates as mountainous, it was never a separate region.

Hello Mion.  I think you are confused regarding the last edit I did to Bioconversion of biomass to mixed alcohol fuels.  Please check out the links again.  You will notice that those links basically are simply Dr. Holtzapple's presentation, which is already cited there in the article (reference # 1 in the present version after your rv), but Dr. Holtzapple simply speaks as the slides are shown.  If you notice, there was already a video clip of Dr. Holtzapple giving a presentation (reference #2 in present version), but in that clip he presents about a lot of things, whereas in the ones I added, he concentrates only on Bioconversion of biomass to mixed alcohols fuels.  What exactly made you think that this was a """"shameless pushing for publicity"""" as you put it? The name of the company that is commercializing this technology (i.e., Terrabon, L.L.C.) does not appear ANYWHERE in those video clips, only the University LOGO of the College of Agriculture who were the ones who made the video clips.

The TIGHAR-Nikumaroro Fiasco
Two years of speculation and hype came to a numbing climax on
March 16, 1992, at the National Press Club in Washington,
D.C. At a crowded news conference receiving national TV
coverage, Richard Gillespie, executive director of The International
Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery [TIGHAR], unabashedly
announced that the Amelia Earhart mystery “is solved.”
Since early 1990, following the group’s first excursion to Nikumaroro,
a 3.5-mile long coral atoll in the Phoenix Islands, about 2,100 miles
southwest of Hawaii and three hundred miles south of Howland Island,
the national media had touted TIGHAR’s theory that Nikumaroro could
be the final resting place of Amelia Earhart and Fred Noonan.
The “evidence” Gillespie presented included a battered piece of aluminum,
a weathered size 9 shoe sole labeled “Cat’s Paw Rubber Co.,
USA,” a small brass eyelet, and another unlabeled heel the group found
on Nikumaroro during TIGHAR’s highly publicized return there in
October 1991. These items, elaborately displayed and labeled in a glass
case, all came from Earhart or her Electra, according to Gillespie.
“There may be conflicting opinions, but there is no conflicting evidence,”
Gillespie said. “I submit that the case is solved.” Gillespie then
bit his lip and looked down at the floor — a curious yet revealing display
of body language for someone claiming to have solved one of the
20th century’s greatest mysteries.
Gillespie and Patricia R. Thrasher, TIGHAR’s husband-and-wife
team, theorize that through a navigational error, Earhart and Noonan
overflew Howland Island and landed on a reef on Nikumaroro during
low tide. There they died of dehydration a short time later. The plane,
they said, was washed over the reef when the tide came in and now lies
under 2,000 feet of ocean.
The April 1992 Life magazine featured a six-page spread penned by
Gillespie, who cites Navy pilot John Lambrecht’s July 9, 1937 report:
“Signs of recent human habitation were clearly visible [on
Nikumaroro], but “repeated circling and zooming failed to elicit any
answering wave from possible inhabitants.” Gillespie called this report
“hugely significant” and “tragically inadequate. What had not been
done in 1937 had to be done now. We would have to search
Nikumaroro.”
Gillespie credited two retired military aviators, Tom Gannon and
Tom Willi, of Fort Walton Beach, Florida, for the theory’s origin.
“Using celestial tables, Gannon pointed out that on the morning of July
2, 1937, the rising sun would have provided the precise line of position
Earhart said she was running,” Gillespie wrote in Life. “By flying
southeast along that line, Noonan could be sure that, even if he missed
Howland, he would reach an island in the Phoenix group in about two
hours. Clearly it was the safest, sanest course to follow. I traced the line
on the chart and read the name of the island: Nikumaroro.”
This supposition was convincing to some, but Devine wasn’t
impressed. “There is considerable information in Gillespie’s rendition that
can be faulted,” Devine writes. “One example is his attempt to foster a line
between Howland Island and Nikumaroro. He presents Earhart’s last message
as ‘We are on line 157/337 ... We are running on line.’
Earhart never reached Howland Island. Earhart never
saw Howland Island, therefore Howland Island is not a reference
point for a landing on Nikumaroro. Earhart’s authentic
last message received by Coast Guard personnel on board
the Itasca, and recorded by Commander Thompson, related
no reference point: ‘We are on line of position 157-337 ...
We are running north and south.’ Earhart was not flying east
toward Howland Island or Hawaii. She was on a course, a
compass course or line of position 157-337, which terminates
on the island of Saipan.1
With Our Own Eyes
– 163 –
– 164 –
Earhart was not adept at navigation, and may have stated
her reading from a pocket compass she carried on her person.
She was probably and almost certainly stressed by ensuing
events, especially if Noonan had been rendered unconscious
during the almost disastrous takeoff of the overladen plane.
If Noonan had not been incapacitated, I assure you that he,
one of the best air-and-sea navigators of that period, would
have been communicating. He would have guided their
plane on a pre-arranged course, and calculated for accura",0,0,0,0,0,0

 links 

Dharmabum420 and others seem to enjoy removing links from the article. I am not a webmaster or even know one. I found the site outside the wall on my space, and since then have found it to be quicker on posting news and tour info then any of the other sites. I think it deserves a link here with the others. I must admit, I messed up the link by missing a few rules to begin, but since then have fixed that. Dharmabum420 said it seemed self promotion, well I simply just copied the title of the page, it is not self promotion. Since then I have written what features the site holds, but it continues to be removed. Google stats do not legitimate how good a site is for info, and this is NOT a rule by Wikipedia, so stop treating it as one. Thank you, please keep the link 
I would suggest the link be removed until a consensus can be reached here.
I'll assume that it's not self-promotion despite the earlier """"greatest site ever!"""" type description, but regardless, I would personally argue against the inclusion of the site, for a variety of reasons:
Wikipedia is not a link repository, and guidlines suggest only one fan site for such an article, and we already have far more than that.
No Google hit within the first 100 links in a """"pink floyd"""" search and no Alexa rating; while not a set policy on Wikipedia, such rankings are often used to determine a site's notability when trying to decide whether to include the site in an article already well-stocked with other, high-rated sites.
The only content on the site that is not easily available on far more popular sites is a selection of photos of people's tattoos. While mildly interesting, it's hard to argue that it increases the value of the Pink Floyd article itself, as few people who read the article will be searching it out for information on Pink Floyd tattoos.
Much content on the site is commerical, marketing T-shirts and the like. This is clear in the discography, which holds no information other than a simple list of the albums (available on Wikipedia itself anyway) with links to purchase them to an Amazon seller account.
The site in question is very low-quality compared to the rest of the resource links; confusing, messy and difficult to navigate, intrusive music with no way of turning it off, and it has major compatibility problems with Firefox 1.5 and Safari (perhaps others, that's what I've got to try).
That's my 2¢ on this particular site. - a 

I'll double 's 2¢ and even add in another penny to make it an even nickel. It's a very sub-par site and doesn't contribute anything to this article.  

I will disagree with both of you. while you claim only one fan site is appropriate, it clearly states """"Note: fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included.)"""" this fansite is very imformative and has more details on wanted details. For example, this site has details about a On an island live dvd with a direct link to saying David will record the rah shows for a dvd. Visit the other sites, none of them have this info and this is just one instance. You are wrong about it being the normal material. Also after paying attention to this site for sometime, it has continued to be the first in announcing tour dates for Rogers tour, and apparently has already secured a interview with one of Rogers bandmates. While you may think that the videos on the site are annoying, many fans love this. I am one of them, I cant think of another site where I can view much of the videos on this site. You say its difficult to navigate and I laugh at that, there is a simple naviagtion bar at the left hand side of each page, just like fleeting glimpses bar. Also every site has a discography, but very few have a videography, this alon makes this site better then most. So it has some comercial availability...so what? It still is a great source of info. Your google pink floyd rankings are a joke. 80 out of the first 100 are not updated and far subpar then this site. I wonder how many people search for pink floyd tattos, probably far more then you think, because I for one know of no other site that has this, and I have picked a tat from the site to get myself. This site deserves a link and I disagree with both of you

 Also now that I think about it, show me another site that streams Davids mermaid gig, or has each of his promo videos for tracks of the new album? Not even DG.com has those avaialable anymore. Also how about the interview on the Roger waters tour page? Link the other fansite that has this. None do. This site was also the first that had Rogers complete touring band lineu",0,0,0,0,0,0

Sorry to annoy you again mate but I also feel that these pages need to be addressed as when I tried to make changes he changed it all back
first is the Category:Townsville/Thuringowa, Queensland I think this needs to be Townsville and Thuringowa (remove the / )
next is Electoral district of Mundingburra here he says """"The seat is one of four within the Townsville-Thuringowa urban centre in North Queensland"""" and this is not it is in Townsville and has nothing to do with Thuringowa city.
the next one is of the most concern to me as it is misleading Electoral district of Thuringowa here he says """"The division encompasses suburbs of the City of Thuringowa on the western edge of the Townsville–Thuringowa urban centre"""" if you have a look back at the edits I tried to do you will see that I made a good point as his ref is from a reporters POV and mine is from the Gov's website Thuringowa is a city (LGA) and has it's own voting system we don't vote for Townsville so Townsville should not be listed here but I will leave it up to you.
the next page is Electoral district of Townsville again he has """"The seat is one of four within the Townsville-Thuringowa urban centre"""" as with the others the urban area is what he says is the """"city"""" but the Electoral district also is rural so it is not just part of the urban area so I feel that on the Townsville one it should have Thuringowa removed and on the Townsville one have Thuringowa removed (please see my edits and you will know what I mean)...you will also see that he has said on the Townsville one that the """"Townsville Electorate is bordered by the Hinchinbrook (North), Burdekin (South), Mundingburra (South and West) and Thuringowa (West) Electorates."""" but yet he has put Townsville-Thuringowa on all the pages.
also please see the list of pages below as he has put Townsville/Thuringowa on them and it should read Townsville and Thuringowa due to the page being about places in both cities or the places in Thuringowa should be removed from this page or changed to Townsville and Thuringowa,

but this one he has almost correct just to show you how it should be Suburbs of Townsville the only thing i would change here would be Townsville and Thrunigowa not just Townsville,

Additionally, adding the 'unsourced' tag to Iranian peoples is quite innapropriate. A simple look at the page shows at least 12 sources, not 0, as the tag implys.""""

Well what I was trying to explain is that I never make any personal statements about him (with the exception of """"to promote a positive image of Iran and Iranians"""", which, as I explained later in the same section, any person assuming good faith would take as an insult). You also might want to talk to him about accusatory statements such as this one, personally pointing me out by name. I never did anything comparable to this. Is this in accordance with your policy of """"we discuss articles, not users""""???? 

As for the unsourced tag, it's been discussed in the talk page. The article does not provide any sources discussing the subject of the article. All the sources provided are about other ethnic groups, but they make side comments that have been taken out context and are contradictory to some of the other statements appearing on the page. The article is on Iranian peoples, so it should contain at least one source discussing who these people are. Such a source has yet to be provided. 

I think the article was initially meant to be written on the linguistic group of all speakers of Iranian languages, but the definition has changed considerably due to some misunderstandings (Iran is also the name of a country and some Iranian citizens see themselves as part of a greater ethnic group, that of """"Iranian peoples"""" - see the article on Greater Iran for signs of this). I'm not sure what's the best way to move on from here. The article definitely has to be rewritten with a clear definition in mind, but a lot of users are not being cooperative. I'd consider any advice or mediation. Thanks, Talk

A question for   It may seem an odd question to WP purists, but considering the importance WP places on reliability of secondary sources, why does WP not require a same or similar vetting process of its editors, particularly those who seem to speak only for themselves?  The entire concept of requiring contributors to discuss/argue with a username is absurd in its most basic interpretation.  For all I know, I could be spinning my wheels fighting for accuracy with a demented, mind game-playing geek living in inner Mongolia.  It is imperative, in my mind, that those who demand respect offer up some sort of evidence, as I have, of their actual ability, credibility, reliability, accountability...  their authority to control.  If it's required of the sources, it should certainly be required of those who quote them and write about them.  Similarly, how do I """"call for consensus?""""

I think there are passages in Proudhon that read like minarchism. But there are just as many others if not more that don't. Whatever Larry Gambone says (I see that's where you've been taking your Proudhon quotes from, which is I guess why you never give decent references), there is certainly inconsistency - or at least, a greater degree of complexity than I think you are willing or able to accept, in Proudhon's work. But then who isn't inconsistent? As I said, it's not hard to find quotes in Proudhon that are against anarchism or that support property (in the full-blown sense). That doesn't mean that he was never an anarchist. 

I think 'On the general idea of the revolution in the 19th century' has his fullest discussion of the state and of his version of an anarchist society. It's definitely worth reading, and is widely available in english (though unfortunately I don't think it's on the net). 

In Section IV (On the principle of authority) you can find for example:

""""We conclude without fear that the revolutionary formula should not be direct legislation, nor direct government, nor simplified government; it is no more government.""""

""""Neither monarchy, nor aristocracy, nor even democracy, where this third term implies some or other government acting in the name of the people and calling itself the people. No authority, no government, even of the people: there is the revolution.""""

And there's plenty more in that vein.

f2b695aaeda9cc0a,"Deletion of Malenovski and Kiev school district citations 

Given that this is a contested article, I wanted to explain my reasoning in recent changes.  Firstly,  I inserted exact statistical per centages for the # of schools teaching in Ukrainian.  I did this b/c using partly to characterize 48% and overwhelmingly to characterize 70% is really pushing it.  48% is almost 1/2 and 70 is about 3/4.  Partly sounds like 1/5-2/5 and overwhelmingly is somewhere between 85%-99% broadly understood.

Now about the Kiev's school district footnote.  In my opinion, whereas the information is true, it is too narrow for our purposes here.  Citing national or at least regional statistics seems more appropriate.  As for Malenovski's article, the issue was unverifiability of the statistics.  I read through the article and came to the section where Malenovski cites the numbers (towards the end).  They are there, but no original source is named, no link is given for verification of the numbers.  Finally, I hope that wikipedia editors contributing to Ukrainization will continue to insist on the level of scholarship expected and enforced for sources/articles dealing with the Holodomor article.  Citing Malenovski and going to the lengths of translating his pov (in this case) is rather unacceptable.

By the way, I certainly prefer Gogol in Russian than in translation to English, Polish or Ukrainian.  How can you not love?:

Gyan Publishing and circular refs
I'm reinventing the wheel you discovered: WP:RSN#""""Faith & philosophy of Hinduism"""".     talk   
Yikes. Those pseudo sources are back again. I knew I should have started WP:List of Circular References way back then. Just never got around to it (and I had some disagreement from other editors at that time). What do you think, Will? Would this be a good idea? — (talk) 
Another pseudo-source I see used often are some books called something like the """"Webster Book of quotations on Politics"""" (but that's not it), which are issued on a variety of topics. They cite their source as Wikipedia, but they abbreviate it """"WP"""" and many editors don't catch that.  I think there's merit in a central list. It wouldn't fluctuate much - books aren't going to be re-issued to address the problem, though some websites might fix it. The only gray area I see are those sources which cite Wikipedia, where it's possible to exclude the WP-sourced content and still use the other parts. I suppose that a search of the RSN archives and of pages that link to WP:CIRCULAR would find most instances that have been discussed. This problem is only going to get worse as Wikipedia continues to grow and as publishers grow more desperate for profit in a dwindling market.     talk   
I agree. The problem will only get worse and, over time, it becomes more difficult to parse the article histories to determine if/when the article was copied. And rather than search through the growing mountain of archives, it would be nice to be able to quickly direct an editor to a previous discussion  especially in cases like ISHA and Gyan which will obviously pop up again. I think what would work is a page with a table format which lists the title, the publisher, a link to the RSN archived discussion, and a Notes column which discuss those 'gray areas""""  whether the entire source is copied or particular chapters/sections. I'll try to work something up over the weekend and then ask for your input.  — (talk)

 Pretty badly written introduction. 

Namely that the writer seems more interested in writing about common law than civil law. While I am sure some degree of comparison is very useful, if not necessary, I don't think that going to great lengts to explain what common law is and then just say """"and civil law is not like this"""" is a very good way of defining civil law.

The 4th paragraph in the intro (the largest one) is the main culprit here. In fact the third sentence in it doesn't even follow on properly from the first two and should logically read pretty much the opposite of what it does. In addition it seems to be be very US-centric: while it mentions English Common Law, it then goes on to list examples of basic tenets of this which seem to be drawn directly from the US Constitution.

So I think it's pretty badly written as an introduction, but as I don't know too much about the subject I don't really want to go about editing it myself.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Redirect from hoax page """"Hamlet of Denmark"""" 

Hello ! I just wanted to point out that the redirect that you created from Hamlet of Denmark should point to Prince Hamlet (which is the article dedicated to the character) and not to Hamlet. Best regards! (talk) 
 I thought about it, but the play also has King Hamlet, the ghost. (I have no preference either way; if you believe Prince Hamlet would have been a better target, I might reduce the protection for a while, so that you can change it.) -   
 Well, I confess that I have absolutely no idea about how to find whether people who search for """"Hamlet of Denmark"""" are more interested in the prince or in the king. I would say the prince, but it would be only a conjecture. Given the ambiguous nature of the expression, your choice seems the most reasonable. Sorry if I didn't give a better thought on it before contacting you. Cheers! (talk)

 Well, since we're making a list, individual bootlegs don't need to be notable themselves, but I know what you mean, we need some standards for inclusion. As with the sketchy nature of bootlegs themselves, we need to make sure we included only actual bootlegs (I mean """"bootleg"""" in the traditional sense of the word). Generally, I would say if we can find enough information to write a short paragraph or so on it, then let's include it. Most of the sources for this information is going to be found on personal sites of collectors and not really verifiable, so I would say for every inclusion we should have at least two independent sources.

Why? None of the other examples has citations. Why is this needed for the iPod?

Google has  (lots of examples) where """"ipod"""" is used as a generic term for a MP3-player, but is a 'citation' from Google sufficient?

However, I was again frustrated by failure. I have since come to understand that the answer eluded me because it required a lesser mind, or perhaps a mind less bound by the parameters of perfection. Thus, the answer was stumbled upon by another, an intuitive program, initially created to investigate certain aspects of the human psyche. If I am the father of the matrix, she would undoubtedly be its mother.""""

Possibly v1 & v2 also had Ones? The Architect speaks of the anomaly being ineradicable despite his best efforts, in which case it would be present in the eutopia and dystopia versions too.

You say:
X + Y = Z,  Z never Equals X, Z never Equals Y.

It's faulty:
X = 0

C.
What you meant to say is:

If any two variables, X, Y, (X,Y != 0) are added, the sum will never equal any one of the two variables.

D.
But, what if we take a person with 3 different ancestries? In theory, if one has 3 different ancestries they are """"never just one of the ancestries"""", however you would qualify such a statement.

So, X + Y + Z = A, A can never equal X, Y, or Z.

Of course here we'd have to add the condition that X, Y, and Z must be > 0. Whereas in Example C, the variables just cannot equal 0.

The difference between her mugshot photo and the celebrities that you've mentioned is that they are CELEBRITIES, and I feel she isn't a celebrity.  Everyone you mentioned is famous enough AND/OR their crime was (in)famous enough to warrant a mugshot photo.  

If the reason of keeping the photo is that it relates to the article, I say that the drunk driving section is overkill.  It's tabloidism.  Granted, she isn't completely unknown to the public or unpraised by critics, but the entire drunk driving arrest section should be a blurb.  Also, her fame (or lack thereof) and the lack of severity or newsworthiness of the crime (even though I loathe drunk driving) is why the photo should be removed.

...which ‎Guest2625 removed with the explanation that this entry doesn't contain the """"terms"""" used in my sentence.  

There's a theoretical explanation for the world's current tax system...either that or we're all crazy.  If you're saying that this entry doesn't at all discuss the theoretical basis for our tax system...then clearly that's a problem.  You don't solve that problem by removing the one sentence that does mention the justification for our tax system...you solve it by creating the section that does provide the justification.  In order to do that...you first have to review all the references that I added to the benefit principle entry.  If you're not willing to make that effort...then please don't edit this entry. 

Having already read through all those reliable sources and many many many more...here's my take.  This paper...The Pure Theory of Public Expenditure...by Paul Samuelson has been cited over 5,000 times.  It provides the definitive theoretical justification for our tax system.  Samuelson's argument was that the benefit principle had a very limited scope because of the preference revelation problem...a problem which tax choice effectively solves. That's it...that's our tax system in a nutshell.  That's the bottom line that readers should not have to wade through miles of minor details to find.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Preliminary investigation by a private agency does not rule out the possibility of the State's involvement, however ludicrous that may seem. 

While it is hard to provide any direct evidence of such a connexion, it is obvious that the killer's psychology and motivation were in some way aided by external agents, who may have been funded by Public moneys.

The above conclusion is based on -

1. Extensive tracking of ABB by State agencies prior to the attack 

2. Facilitating the procurement of arms and explosives.

3. Behavior of ABB during the attack, hints at Immunity, not Rage or Hate.

4. Social exclusion and brainwashing by agents close to ABB - denial of any employment, or opportunity, or correction, or sanitation of ABB in spite of previous crimes.
It is a well known fact that Agents in Norge subscribe to """"Voice Transmission"""" - implanting ideas in other minds like a radio.

5. An Almost Impossible explanation for the Genocide - Islamophobia - killing natives (children) has nothing to do with it, unless it is a Fear Tactic with supposedly greater meaning.

This does indicate an extremely feudal and ancient societal structure prevalent in Norge.

The Agency is completely confident of the above claims and will back it to death.

The investigation shall continue.

0edc87d7b769dc5c,"""With over 100,000 college students studying abroad every year, there's bound to be all kinds of tall tales, urban legends, and misinformation swirling around.  While there may be grains of truth in some of these stories, below are some common misconceptions about study abroad.

Misconception #1: Studying abroad is very expensive.

Truth: In most cases, it is actually cheaper to study abroad.  Let's say the tuition at your school is $5,000 per semester and room and board is another $4,000.  Now add in the additional fees you have such as health insurance, books, and laundry.  You are now well over $10,000 for the semester.  Well, all but one of our programs in Spain is under $10,000 per semester and that includes everything except your airfare and spending money.
TAB

Misconception #2: I can't use my financial aid to study abroad.

Truth: In almost all cases, your federal aid (Stafford loans, Pell grants, etc.) can be used to study abroad and in some states, you can use your state aid as well.  It is also not uncommon for your federal aid to increase when you study abroad since some of your school scholarships may not transfer.

Misconception #3: Host families are all poor and just do it for the money.

Truth: The last thing any study abroad company wants to do is have an unhappy student on their program.  The goal is for the students to be happy so that they will tell their friends what a great time they had.  If we were putting students in bad families, in dangerous neighborhoods, then no one would ever recommend us to their friends.  Since the number of universities that endorse our program doubled over the last year, it's a pretty sure bet that students are happy with our choice of families. 

Misconception #4: I'll be so busy with schoolwork that I won't get time to see the country I'm in.

Truth: This one is hysterically funny since your average study abroad student comes home with about 400+ photos from a long list of countries.  Students have plenty of opportunities to travel and we even take our students on trips to give them a better feel for the country they are in.

Misconception #5: I might not graduate on time if I go abroad.

Truth: If you have already used up all of your elective or general education courses, then it's true that you might need to bulk up on courses before or after you go abroad.  If you plan ahead, however, and leave some electives open to you, then you should be fine.  The clear majority of students who study abroad still graduate in four years, despite being away from their home campus for a semester or two.

Misconception #6: Most of the world hates Americans, so I won't be safe.

Truth: There's no doubt that there are a lot of people who don't like the American government, but that has nothing to do with the American people.  If you compare the violent crime rate in the United States to that of European, Australian, or Asian countries, you will see that the United States is actually far more dangerous.  There are some areas of South America and Africa that are not especially safe, but there are also many countries on those continents that are incredibly safe.  Go to the U.S. State Department website and check out the crime statistics on the country you are interested in to see how safe it is.

Studying abroad is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that every college student should take advantage of.  Before dismissing it due to the bad experience of one friend or rumors you have had heard, speak with your study abroad advisor and get the facts.  I guarantee that once you look at all that studying abroad can offer you, you'll be hopping the first flight abroad.

One organization that help ensure that you have safest, unforgettable yet affordable study abroad experience is Academic Studies Abroad.    Here are some of our very popular study abroad programsin the following countries:

-Study Abroad Spain- Academic Studies offers study abroad programs in Barcelona, Madrid, Salamanca and Sevilla.  

-Study Abroad England- Academic Studies offers study abroad programs in London.  

-Study Abroad Italy - Academic Studies offers study abroad programs in Florence.  

-Study Abroad France- Academic Studies offer study abroad programs in Aix-en-Provence and Avignon.

I had to learn all this copyright stuff the hard way myself when I was looking for photos to put on the Duran Duran article (which is now a featured article, btw); the ones that are there now are press release photos, which Wikipedia has decided can be used if they're tagged with  (one of the Wikipedia:image copyright tags).

1659ed55c9111a68,"""After this case, the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) attempted a nationwide assessment of child grooming.  The report found that police, social services and charities were failing to properly investigate this """"hidden issue"""" and that a quarter of offenders reported for child grooming since 2008 were Asian, an apparently disproportionate figure, but Peter Davies, the head of Ceop, was quick to clarify that the findings did not provide a national picture because of incomplete data, and cautioned against extrapolating anything from the results. He added that """"looking at this issue through the lens of ethnicity does not do the victims any favours.""""

Again - I'm not sure that this section needs to exist. Also from the outset it is misleading. CEOP constantly monitor for and act upon child grooming  - they didn't suddenly decide to start after this case. 

CEOP has existed since April 2006 and there has been a phased introduction of their work in conjuration with partners ever since - starting it's main recognised operations in 2009, by which time the police were acting. The wording implies that CEOP had not acted earlier to protect the victims - they could not act they did not exist! TTFN

 Housewife

 Citation templates 

Hi Conrad. I would appreciate if you could take the citation templates under your auspices. I know you are one of the best template specialists here, and you have been a great help during the WP:AUM wars, for which I was and am very thankful. Now  (used on more than 15,000 pages), , .  are fully protected and the admins that drop by there don't always know what they are doing. Since I've done a lot there and tried to keep things running there it would be a shame if everything would go down there, after I (and others) have invested that much their wiki time (including you!). I intend to step back there a bit, not alone due to the fact that I can't edit anymore there, but it's nevertheless a good breaking point. I do not intend to leave Wikipedia completely, but I start getting some serious """"all is done what I could do"""" feelings. So I probably won't be that much around as during the WP:AUM wars last years. Thanks for everything and whishing you all the best.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

He is the president of NOMAS and, to quote an article on the front page of his site today:

Want To Be A Good Dad? Support Mom And Avoid Father’s Rights Groups

Over the past decade, fatherhood has been all the rage and dads are naturally the talk of pundits on Father’s Day. So let’s say you’re a divorcing dad and you’re having trouble coping. You look for help on the internet and discover the father’s rights movement.

Be warned – avoid father’s rights groups like the plague. According to the pro-feminist men’s group The National Organization For Men Against Sexism (NOMAS), “male supremacist groups (“Father’s Rights”) have caused unspeakable harm to our country and to our children by encouraging abusive fathers, often with little past involvement with their children, to seek custody as a tactic to pressure a mother to return or to punish her for leaving. “Shared parenting”, “friendly parent”, involvement of both parents and other concepts that seem fair and benevolent have instead been used to manipulate courts and legislatures to help abusive fathers.

Again, these are feminist groups that, frankly, view men as biologically and culturally flawed to begin with and father's as unnecessary opining as to the beliefs and goals of people interested in father's rights and, here on Wikipedia, they are characterized as, not just authoritative sources for information on father's rights groups, but also members of those groups who act as their spokesman.  It should go without saying but quotes like the above and sources that make them would be universally reviled by anyone interested in father's rights advocacy.  When authors like this are cited it should be clarified that they are hostile to father's and father's rights and have views that are diametrically opposed to any that the mainstream FRM would actually espouse",0,0,0,0,0,0

That being said, I think you should look close at what they edited, and come to your own conclusion. They gutted whole articles.

I will not abide an abuse of power, and will not let this rest without their being brought to justice  they are bullies, and this was wrong.

I for one would not stand silently and idly by while the Wehrmacht makes the Jews disappear into the railroad cars.

Moreover, their actions showed an intent (and attempt) to bully me into silence about their misconduct. It was a cover up.

Accountability in this system is important. Those who abuse their powers do not deserve to be trusted to hold the reins. They deserve the severest sanctions, and should be stripped of administrative privileges.

  is correct as regards changing one's name.  As per the reference he supplied, in the Republic of Ireland, all that is necessary is that one begins using the new name, and that it not be done for fraudulent purposes.  Doing so is extremely common - how many thousands of women, for example, take their husband's surname on marriage without getting their name changed by deed poll?  Changing one's name in this way is an entirely different thing from having one's Registration of Birth amended, where specific statutes apply.

So one can change one's name in common usage from, e.g., George to Jack, but George would remain on the Register of Births, unless you also changed it by deed poll.

 Feral Dogs 
Something about what is said about feral dogs in the article doesn't match with observations on feral dogs. Actually it doesn't even match with some articles in wikipedia. E.G. the Dingo is a feral dog too and they are excellent hunters, as well as the Carolina Dogs, who even seem to have some unique hunting skills. It's also wrong to assume that feral dog packs lack the social structure of wolf packs, you should browse for """"Tuscany Dog Project"""" (thats a study concerning this topic) and the dogs there, although not completely feral, have a very complex social structure in their pack (check the german version of wikipedia if you like, there's a full article). Also wolves don't form packs on general, in Italy and in Germany as well many packs only consist of the parents, their current litter, and the litter of the last year. In Italy, there are many solitary wolves and many who only live in pairs, as well as quite a few packs of feral and semi-feral dogs who can hunt prey wolves aren't capable of and who are competing or interacting with wolves (depends on the situation). So all in all feral dogs aren't that poor.168.224.32.15  

The dingo has had thousands of years to revert back to a semi-ativistic state. Domestic dogs havent had that amount of time to become fully fledged wild animals.

While domestic dogs do form packs, there is little monogamy, cooperative hunting, or mutual puppy care.129.12.200.49  

In all cases? If known cases of adoption, care for puppies by aunts (I admit, there is no prove for care by males), monogamy and cooperative hunting. As a matter of fact, these things aren't as common among wolves as most people think. Don't you think, you generalize to much?
E.G. Erik Zimen (a famous cynologist in Europe) witnessed no monogamy in his poodle group. Observations by Eberhard Trummler and Elizabeth Marshall Thomas came to different results (the first observed dingo/wolf/dog-mixes and the latter Sibirian Huskies), as well as Guenther Bloch in his studies in Italy (two groups and one pack of near-feral dogs, mostly or entirely mongrels). You should keep in mind, that there isn't much data concerning this topic and it wouldn't be the first time that an observer didn't really observe and just judged by what he/she already thought to be true. Remember, for a long time people thought, that wolves would generally form packs with an alpha on the top and an omega on the bottom of the pack or that dogs would always search the nearness of humans, because """"they are born that way"""". Both """"Facts"""" have been proven to be wrong since at least the 80's, although they are still in the mind of many people.  

Laughter in dogs?

 """"First edition preferred"""" 

Hi.  I was amused to see this added to the infobox on The Small Rain, published in 1945. Having collected L'Engle novels for over 30 years, I've still never even SEEN the original cover of this book - and if I did, I'd have to think long and hard before spending several hundred dollars to buy it and scan it for Wikipedia. Rest assured that I will always post first edition covers if I have them, but it's not always possible. For example, my hardback of The Young Unicorns is an ex-library rebinding.  I've searched online for the cover of the first edition, and nobody has one posted.  All I see is lots and lots of copies of the current paperback cover art. No big deal at this end - I know you're just adding standardised info on what we want to post whenever possible. Still, I'll be very surprised if we ever get 100% compliance on L'Engle books of the 1940s to 1960s. Regards, and keep up the good work!  | Talk | contribs """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi,um, This is not correct English composition;  """"prohibited in article text, that is, how they were recently used here""""
When you use id est or """"That is"""" in that context you are expounding upon and explaining the original sentence, e.g., prohibited in article text, that is"""", you can't use it. You used an example, thus e.g. or the English equivalent """"for example"""", or the more simplistic, """"like"""", ''prohibited in article text, like, how they were recently used here.
As far as this:WP:ACCESS#Users_with_limited_CSS.2FJavaScript_support, 
""""However', consideration for users without CSS or JavaScript should extend mainly to making sure that their reading experience is possible; it is recognised that it will inevitably be inferior"""".

I may be wrong but your reference to WP:HiddenFunction concerns hiding text not to a collapsible table.
'''As of December 29, 2006, this technique is disabled on this wiki. The class hiddenStructure still exists in the CSS, but now outlines the text in green instead of hiding the text. This is to find any remaining instances of hiddenStructure in templates. Note that this only disables use of the CSS class hiddenStructure. It does not prevent use of similar tags like display: none or visibility: hidden.

The collapsible boxes contain information that serves as an addendum to what is in the article. It adds to the reading experience by making the page neater. The example I used with the """"Genes"""" is a prime example, looking at that abortion is enough to give somebody a headache.

The collapsible boxes I added in the Auschwitz concentration camp and the Mathausen concentration camp articles, among others, makes the pages look neater and more interesting. Nobody has complained about:WP:ACCESS.

However, HBC is also used in other episodes of the series such as South Park Is Gay, where it's a stand-in for Bravo (or more likely its parent company, NBC).

 Requested move 

:Thompson people →  – This move was done by a speedy change, not by RM, with MOSTCOMMON and ENGLISH being used as the reasons.  But CANENGL applies on Canadian English articles on Canadian topics, and """"Nlaka'pamux"""" is now the standard in Canadian English, and like other indigenous endonyms in Canada is now the expected norm.  Unlike the parallel RMs at Lillooet people/St'at'imc and Chilcotin people/Tsilhqot'in, where there is a marked difference in google results, the difference in google results here is marginal, though still in favour of Nlaka'pamux, which gets 28,200 results vs for """"Thompson people"""" there are 28,000 - but a glance at the first page of that search demonstrates that not all of those are about these people.  I don't have t ime at the moment to search on media sources such as the Vancouver Sun or [http:thetyee.ca The Tyee], which are in British Columbia, or in the Globe and Mail....but I know the results will overwhelmingly favour """"Nlaka'pamux""""....as do the people themselves.

Hi there.

It's great that you welcomed a user on User talk:Zoe molina, however, there were a couple of problems. I think that you probably used copy-and-paste, so, the links did not work, and the 'helpme' was actually on the page - the big 'I have a question' box was appearing.

Also, you added a non-free picture, and they cannot be used on user pages.

In future, the best thing to do is, use a 'welcome' template - you would put, for example. {{subst:welcome}} (and then sign with ~~~~. That will add a 'standard' welcome on their page, and all the links will work.

You could make a test page of your own - User:Percyfangirl44/test - and try it on there.

For more help, you can either;

Leave a message on my own talk page; OR
Use a {{helpme}} - please create a new section at the end of your own talk page, put {{helpme}}, and ask your question - remember to 'sign' your name by putting ~~~~ at the end; OR

Image copyright problem RE: Image:Zeorin.jpg

Thanks for uploading Image:Zeorin.jpg. The Wikimedia Foundation is very careful about the images included in Wikipedia because of copyright law. We need you to specify two things on the image description page:
 The copyright holder, and
 The copyright status

The copyright holder is usually the creator. If the creator was paid to make this image, then their employer may be the copyright holder. If several people collaborated, then there may be more than one copyright holder. If you created this image, then you are the copyright holder.

Because of the large number of images on Wikipedia, we've sorted them using image copyright tags. Just find the right tag corresponding to the copyright status of this image, and paste it onto the image description page like this: {{TAGHERE}}.  

There are 3 basic ways to licence an image on Wikipedia:
An open content licence
Public Domain
Fair Use

The copyright holder gets the best protection of their work by licencing it under an open content license such as the Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike licence. If you have the express permission of the copyright holder to licence their work under the above licence, use the image copyright tag: . The GNU Free Documentation License is another option. Again, if you have the express permission of the copyright holder, use the tag .

The copyright holder can also release their work into the public domain. See here for examples.

Images from certain sources are automatically released into the public domain. This is true for the United States, where the Wikimedia servers are located. (See here  for images from the government of the USA and here for other governments.)  However, not all governments release their work into the public domain. One exception is the UK (see here for images from the UK government). Non-free licence governments are listed here. 

Also, in some cases, an image is copyrighted but allowed on Wikipedia because of fair use. To see a) if this image qualifies, and b) if so, how to tag it, see Wikipedia:Fair use.  

For more information, see Wikipedia:Image copyright tags. Please remember that untagged images are likely to be deleted.

If you have uploaded other images without including copyright tags, please go back and tag them. Also, please tag all images that you upload in the future.

Any line segment can be divided continuously ad infinitum.
At all times, with each division, the length of each part shortens by a half,
while at the same time, the number of parts multiplies by two.
So, how can an infinite number of parts
make up a finite whole? Because for every division, the lengths
of the parts are reducing as fast as the number of parts are increasing.   

There is not enough in sources for Zeno's writings to fully justify saying that Zeno ever actually claimed that the sum of an infinite number of numbers is infinite - though he has been interpreted that way by some. What is clear is that he thinks a task with an infinite number of steps cannot be completed.   01:03, 10 August 2012",0,0,0,0,0,0

That's ridiculous, just take one look at the article. Any other point of view besides the russian one would do some good. 
I also, didin't see a dispute except with russian poster whom I believe are too brainwashed by their own government controlled media to even have a rational discussion, that's what happened to the rest of the editors on the article.

Hi, nice to meet you. I'm mostly into classical music, but I'll take a peek at Smashed Gladys on your account. I would suggest waiting until you've been here at least three months or so, usually people are hesitant to grant adminship to someone who hasn't been here that long.

Hi Pickelbarrel. Well, I'm a Wikipedia:Administrator, which means that, apart from the usual work of editing and writing articles I can do a few additional things associated with trying to keep the place running smoothly and cleaning up when it runs less smoothly. So I can (un)delete articles, (un)block account, (un)protect pages and edit protected pages within strict limits. That's all, though. Some people find these things useful, others are fine with never having those additional abilities and the responsibilities that come with them.

The actual process to becoming an admin is to make a Request for Adminship, in which the community will scrutinise your general conduct and work. Generally, the community does not grant adminship to users with less than 3 months of good contribution across a reasonably broad spectrum of activity. After all, if you're going to have the ability to help look after the place, you need to be well-familiar with how it normally looks and works. So you need to show that your responsible and trustworthy, civil when in conflict and that you have a good grasp of the various policies, guidelines and common practises. There's a lot of advice in WP:GRFA which you can look through. You can also read through the current nominations on WP:RFA and see the reasons people give for supporting and opposing requests.

You may find that your time on Wikipedia is entirely fulfilling without the additional admin tools — after all, you don't need any of them to actually write the encyclopedia. -talk

Yes. A new logo was leaked to Kotaku from a GameStop employee. It was marketing material, verified by Kotaku and IGN in their post, that stated it could not be displayed until the week of March 3. And there was that Dutch writer who stated he was at a closed press event at Rocksteady at the beginning of February, with an embargo on information until March. It looks as though it could possibly be Game Informer's next cover story. And then last night IGN found that piece on the Hush facebook page, but there is some question to the official nature to that page. Also, if you remember Azrael's speech in City, he says that soon """"Gotham will burn"""", which might link to the logo, which sees flames around the bat logo. -   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

f632c8f9eff82d84,"On the fringes of any nation the melting pot effect is less pronounced. The homogenisation of England did not permeate beyond the Tamar into the Cornish peninsular until the later half of the 19th century, and it is this fact that gives rise to a separate Cornish identity. In the rest of England the Celtic identity of the Britons was subsumed by the waves of Anglo-Saxon, Danish and Norman invasions, but the King on the throne of England has been the Cornish people’s overlord for some 1200 years. Even so, the Cornish language aside (of which there has not been one native speaker for 150 years), I wonder if this identity is any really any stronger that that of Yorkshire. A Yorkshireman has a distinct identity different from much of England but very few would not claim England to be the nation of their birth.

In the 19th century a Cockney and a Geordie meeting for the first time would have found great difficulty communicating, though they were speaking the same tongue, but both would have been sure they were living in England. England was until relatively recently a land of containing many regional identities and has only relatively recently started to become a blurry single entity. What is England and Englishness anyway? Is it drinking tea?, or eating roast beef?, or playing cricket? or a sense of fair play?, or belief in trial by jury?, or a particular sense of humour? If it is anyone of these I don’t see how the Cornish differ from the English.

Leaving aside these philosophical issues and returning to the realpolitik as sjc calls it the situation is clear. The Cornish nation ceased to exist some 1200 years ago and the duchy of Cornwall is irrelevant to the governmental administration of the region. It is administered by a county council fairly elected by the inhabitants many of whom are happy to call themselves English. Some are not, but some Scots nationalists dislike being called British, the fact remains that Scotland is in Britain (UK) similarly those Cornish people may dislike being called English cannot get away from the fact that as it stands Cornwall remains a county in England until a Cornish nation is re-established. Despite the aspirations of Cornish nationalists/separatists and despite the anachronistic state of affairs regarding the Duchy of Cornwall, Cornwall is currently a county in England and to fail to describe it as such is simply erroneous. It would be a misrepresentation of the facts to state otherwise. 

As for the arguments regarding the specific wording of this article, as long as it continues to state that 'Cornwall is a county of Great Britain' or similar avoidance of the words 'county in England', new readers will contineu to try to correct it back to 'county in England' because rightly or wrongly, that's what everybody apart from a small minority (and as far as Wikipedia is concerned I think it's a minority of one), perceive it to be. 00:41 Sep 10, 2002 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0

 More To Benjiboi 

You wrote on the Sanchez article discussion thread:

 For those looking for the information, Sanchez apparently used to place ads as """"Excellent Top"""" and he a related website http://excellent-top.com/, the access which has since been blocked by the site owner. This is likely the same ad referenced in the Colmes interview and comparing information from the porn site before it was removed unearthed some pretty compelling information but I'm not sure if it warrants much research but it matches information to a Matt Ayala Sanchez with the same birthdate. So might be worth including if reliable sources confirm.

This is incorrect. Sanchez ran Excellent-Top from 1999 to 2002. Then he went into business as """"No Regrets Massage"""" in New York. The phone number from the """"No Regrets Massage"""" ads, which ran in the New York Blade for most of 2004, is where Alan Colmes contacted Sanchez. My partner reached him at the same number. All of this is detailed on my partner's website, which was termed a """"hate site"""" by Elonka and the other senior Wikipedia administrators and editors because it called Sanchez a fool.

My partner thinks Sanchez is a fool, and said so. I agree with my partner, and more. Having an opinion about a set of facts does not invalidate the facts. There is no need for you to reinvent the wheel. All the facts are at that website. Sanchez knows it, and so do the powers-that-be at Wikipedia. They are determined to keep those facts out of the article and drive away anyone who brings them to light, no matter what Wikipedia's rules might say to the contrary.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I had never thought that this double perplexing situation will be resolved so easily and successfully. I am very happy that all the Hindu leaders showed a great understanding and took a totally thoughtful and cooperative stance in the moment of this terrible and responsible situation so that we could arrive at a satisfactory solution to come out of this very complex situation. This could be possible only due to the struggle and vehement efforts made by Mahatma Gandhi for it. I was very surprised when Mahatma Gandhi accepted and gave assent to all my demands and even congratulated me. If he had adopted the same stand in the Second Round Table Conference, this difficult situation wouldn't have arisen. I am very happy to give acceptance and assent to this successful pact. If my Upper Caste brothers wholeheartedly accept and try to implement this pact, then I and my untouchable brothers would be very happy.

1. Moved the Hariakhan Baba paragraph above Post-Yogananda Claims. According to that entry Hariakhan Baba taught from 1860 (before Paramahansa Yogananda was born) to 1924 (before the publication of the Autobiography of a Yogi in 1946). People accepted and revered Hariakhan Baba as the Babaji since pre-Yogananda times. The timing of his appearance also coincides with Lahiri Mahasaya's Kriya Yoga initiation from Babaji (1861).

2. Corrected a minor spelling error from Hari Dasa to Hari Dass.

3. Added Roy Eugene Davis' name and book as support for the Mahavatar Babaji/Hariakhan Baba theory. Basically,  to show that there is someone from the lineage of the author of Autobiography of a Yogi who agrees with Dass and (Mahendra) Baba's conclusion. Roy Eugene Davis was ordained by Paramahansa Yogananda himself in 1951. So, for someone like him to agree that this Hariakhan Baba is the same as the Mahavatar Babaji mentioned by his Master and venerated by all legitimate kriyabans from the Lahiri Lineage is not a light matter.

4. Added Sidhoji Rao Shithole's legal and proper name.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I've always heard that we should never use ten dollar words when twenty-five cent ones will do nicely.

 RE: Just The Facts Ma'am... 

Hello Diligent...

Adding well documented statements of fact that directly contradict a candidates own current """"Official Position"""" is healthy in a free and open forum like wikipedia.  Like with others who are critical, I don't see you being critical of editors who only make reference to un-encyclopedic sources such as a candidate own controlled web page or an un-referenced list of """"official positions"""". According to your reasoning, the political positions section of each candidates page might as well be a direct link to their own web site or positions list from their own hard drive.

As for me I will continue to promote wikipedia as a free medium where by the lobbyests and special interests do not have a corrupting advantage over the rest of us.

 Fixing the article 

I’ll propose below, for comment, a couple of alternative ways to proceed to fix No Gun Ri Massacre. But first ….

The recent interest shown by ,  and, now,  presents a real opportunity to improve the article and bring it back to high WP standards. In the past couple of years, new sources have been published and there have been new developments, including a more settled estimate of the dead from South Korean authorities. They belong in the article.

But it will be a demanding task; there’s a hell of a lot wrong here. And, most of all, to fall back on a cliché, it’s essential not to lose sight of the forest for the trees. One big “forest,” clearly, is the way-out-of-line behavior of WeldNeck, not just at No Gun Ri Massacre, but Wikipedia-wide, as evidenced by the repeated warnings from other contributors, including many he simply deleted from his Talk page, as with ’s edit-warring warning at [], and including ’s observation [] that he has engaged in “POV pushing on all the articles you have edited.” As said, one must go back in his Talk history to find the thousands of illicitly deleted bytes. Then recall his outrageous action of just two days ago, killing my posting here at NGR Talk, and his taunting “have fun with this” when he posted his frivolous bid for a topic ban at ANI. When you combine all this with his dozens and dozens of rapid-fire, unjustified, unexplained reverts at No Gun Ri Massacre, I think it should be clear this is a guy who cannot be trusted on anything.

The “trees,” the distractions, are the red herrings that WeldNeck and other denialists wave on No Gun Ri. (Before WeldNeck, there was an NGR denialist going by """"Kauffner"""" who got banned for general mayhem around WP.) The denialists arose in the year 2000, grasping at anything to attack those whose research work exposed No Gun Ri and thereby made the U.S. Army look less than saintly. One of their problems, along with their blinding anger and their obtuseness about so many things, is that they’re stuck in the year 2000. 

Since then, after long investigations, the South Korean and U.S. governments confirmed that the U.S. military killed the trapped refugees at NGR “by the effects of small-arms fire, artillery and mortar fire, and strafing”; it emerged that more than a dozen military documents showing orders to shoot civilians were suppressed in the U.S. investigation; a Harvard historian reported (in 2005) the discovery of a U.S. ambassadorial letter to the State Department warning, on the day the NGR killings began, that the Army had decided to shoot approaching South Korean refugees (another suppressed document); other media organizations, including the BBC, replicated and then advanced the NGR story beyond the original reporting; a government committee led by South Korea’s prime minister certified a minimal death toll, with identified victims; and the government built a large memorial park and museum at the site where the facts of NGR are enshrined in exhibits and informational material, and where a new, consensus death toll is accepted. This is the “forest” to keep in mind.

Other knowledgeable journalists and academics have looked to me to maintain integrity on this subject in WP and elsewhere, as a retiree with more time available to learn WP's basics and monitor things. But they and I literally haven’t had the stomach even to read the article for many months, so disgusted were we at the way one out-of-control guy was allowed to run roughshod over the truth, not to mention turn it at times into a semi-literate, illogical mess. I’ll swallow hard and read it now.

A couple of possible ways to deal with this problem:

TimothyJosephWood, admirably, was willing to dig right in yesterday. He started from the top of my “litany” of WeldNeck’s unjustified reverts (a list done months ago but never posted until two days ago), and it turned out that first revert, a minor matter, had been remedied since I first noted it. A possible solution: I’ll compare my two lengthy lists of problems (from late 2013 and late 2014) and update them into one that lists problems that still exist. And Mr. Wood or others could then work from that. That might take me one day to prepare.

Alternatively, I myself could begin making edits, and other interested parties could stand by and observe the reaction (and ask for better explanations from me or whatever). In that case, I might as well also assemble some of the new material and sourcing I refer to (to include new external links etc.). That might take me u",0,0,0,0,0,0

Checking the history of Irving Kupcinet's career will establish who was familiar with him.  I believe you are arguing just to be arguing.  

Washington, DC might not have been a mecca for Hollywood movies in 1963, but it was a respectable newspaper market where Irving Kupcinet would have loved to gain more readers.  But he didn't.  His column never reached that city.  All the way until he retired in 2001, very few people in the DC area gave a damn who he was or who his Hollywood friends were.  I was there.  And I can prove Kup's column never was.  If you don't want to be """"little known"""" outside of Chicago, then you better make friends in DC.  It's the Shakespeare capital of the Western Hemisphere because of all the pressure to succeed academically and in public service, but it still has migrants from Illinois  the land of Kupcinet and his name dropping.  Do you know how many people have to work for a congressman or a senator ?  Yet these Illinois people in DC could not read Kup's column when they got homesick.  They couldn't introduce other DC people to Kup's column.  

He was little known outside Chicago, indeed.  So he had something on a network for six months on which Carolyn Jones appeared ?  That's nothing.  In the 1950s the networks were begging for commentators to go on live television, and they came and went without any impact.  Carolyn Jones needed all the exposure she could get.  Her career wasn't on the level of Audrey Hepburn's.

My addition to the article allows that Kupcinet was well - known in Chicago and Los Angeles.  Elsewhere he was a ship passing in the night. News flash: there was no Internet when Karyn Kupcinet died.

Let's see someone other than Wildhartlivie say Irving Kupcinet was well-known outside Chicago and Los Angeles.  Wildhartlivie did a great job on the man's resume, but let's be realistic about who would have given a damn about his daughter's death a month after it happened.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Speedy deletion of Moviedoody
 A tag has been placed on Moviedoody requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done under section A7 of the criteria for speedy deletion, because the article appears to be about a person or group of people, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not indicate the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable, as well as our subject-specific notability guideline for biographies. 

If you think that this notice was placed here in error, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the article (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would would render it more in conformance with Wikipedia's policies and guidelines.

Part III

What's with blanking out the names completely? So much for compromise. I'm going back to COUNTING the pre-1925 champions. Here's why:

1. The outside sources, such as the Encyclopedia Britannica, list them.

2. All the arguments that could be made against the pre-1925 French tournament could also be made against the other three.

3. The idea of the """"slam"""" didn't even emerge until the 1930s, with Don Budge...but do we see anyone black out pre-1938 Wimbledon champs?

4. It's clear that the French tournament was MORE open...their first champ was a Brit, as was two runners-up in the early decades. Interestingly, the US """"Open"""" in 1881 was open only to Americans, and was for several years. Yet we count them, because that's the origin of the tournament.

5. There's also the pro-am dispute, pre-1968. 

6. Wikipedia is supposed to reflect pluralistic viewpoints, not just the one of one person such as Fyunclick who violates WP:OWN to contort this and similar tennis articles to reflect his own views, rather than reflecting outside sources that existed long before Wikipedia did.

The tensor density is not """"artificially introduced"""". The numerical values of the four components of Ad are exactly the same as those which appear three times each among the components of Aa b c along with three each which are their negatives and forty zeros.

If someone naively attempted to use Maxwell's equations in a curvilinear coordinate system or in the presence of significant amounts of gravity, then he would find that they still work in that context (except for the constitutive equations which relate D to E and H to B). How can this be explained in your ideology? It only makes sense when one realizes that some of the quantities are tensor densities.
So please see that I am not adding tensor densities to make life harder.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia.

While blocking IP addresses responsible for anonymous, clear-cut vandalism is routine, many other uses of IP and username blocks are contentious. Where consensus proves elusive, such blocks are damaging to the community.

The most controversial blocks are blocks of:

 suspected """"sock puppets"""" or """"reincarnations"""" of banned users
 logged-in users with a substantial history of valid contributions,' regardless of the reasoning for the block
 blocks made under the disruption provision of the blocking policy.
 blocks that, while possibly wise, lack policy basis.

Once you are convinced that a block is warranted, the recommended procedure for | controversial blocks is:

 Check the facts with care.
 Reread' appropriate parts of Wikipedia:Blocking policy.
 If possible, contact other administrators informally to be sure there are others who agree with your reasoning. The administrators' noticeboard, IRC and email are effective tools for this.
 Place the block, exercising due care in the wording of the """"reason""""  message, and include a link to the user page of the user being blocked.
 Place a notice of the block on the talk page of the affected user, with additional rationale, outlining the facts and the part of the blocking policy you feel applies.
 Be willing to discuss the block with other Wikipedians. Such discussion usually takes place either on the blocked user's talk page, or the administrators' noticeboard (the latter especially in those cases where it was already raised there).

Block wars, in which a user is repeatedly blocked and unblocked, are extremely harmful. They are a source of frustration and disappointment to many seasoned Wikipedians and tend to encourage further bad behavior on the part of the blocked user. Avoid them. Instead, discuss the matter, and try to reach a consensus.

If no consensus has emerged after several respected Wikipedians have reviewed the matter, the user should be left unblocked.

 It's hardly libel, nor is it revenge. I don't even recall a google cache that you got deleted. (Please provide the ref to satisfy my curiosity.) No, this is about circumventing a topic ban by creating a sock. That's all. I happen to hate sockpuppetry and fight it when I see it. You aren't the only one. I often go after socks and hunt them down and make sure they get what they deserve. It's not about admins or not. It really makes no difference. You screwed up royally by using a sock. Your defenses here have only dug your hole deeper by showing you don't understand the seriousness of that offense, and of the reasons for your topic ban. You keep blaming others instead of seeking to understand and promise to reform. I have seen many a blocked editor succeed in getting their block overturned at the last minute by showing they had the ability to learn from their mistakes, take full responsibility for their own actions and the consequences that followed, and show promise that they could develop a positive learning curve. You have flunked on all counts. Too bad. BTW, an indef ban isn't lifelong, IF you avail yourself of the offer proferred above.

 BTW, you have now attempt to get you block overturned three times. I don't recall ever seeing a fourth attempt succeed. Usually it is seen as evidence of WP:IDIDNTHEARHAT and the block then applied to the talk page. Also, if you keep arguing in the manner in which you have been, the result can be the same. You ONLY hope is to show complete contrition and a very clear explanation of exactly what you did wrong and how you regret it and will do better. Nothing less will do.

 Some tips for you! 

Hi , I thought I'd drop a few notes on your talk page with some help on writing articles o)

First of all, it may be best for you to do a bit of reading, starting with the Wikipedia manual of style, which will give you a lot of information about how Wikipedia prefers its articles to be written.  It's not as hard to follow as it might look; quite a bit of the information there probably won't be vital for you at first.

Second, I recommend you make a user sandbox - which is just an area you can use to practise in, and to make notes in, and to get things ready in.  If you click this red link: user:/Sandbox, that will let you create that page (it gives you an edit window to start work in).  Anything, anywhere, on the help and information pages which gives you an example, try it out in your sandbox until you're familiar with it.

For your article, the next thing you want to do is start collecting as much information as you can about it.  Google searches (particularly in Books and Scholar) will be your best friend for this!  Once you've found the information, the next most important thing is to start writing up each fact in your own words (very important, this), and make a note at the same time of exactly where that information came from.  Build in the references as you go along; I'm going to copy in, down below this, a whole heap of help on doing references, which was produced by one of our best teachers ().

Here's another place that you'll find incredibly useful - citation templates which you can copy and paste into your sandbox, between  tags; you just fill in the blanks from your sources into the template, and you'll end up with nicely formatted inline citations o)  It all helps.  Remember to add a references section to your sandbox (make a new line, and put ==References== on it, and type {{reflist}} on the next line, so that you can see how your citations look as you do them.  Remember to save your page often! You don't want to lose your work.

Hopefully this will give you a good start and make life easier for you.  (talk …stalk!) 
How references work

 Simple references 

These require two parts;

a)
Chzz is 98 years old. """"The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 

He likes tea.  [http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com Tea website] 

b) A section called """"References"""" with the special code """"{{reflist}}"""";
== References ==
{{reflist}}

(an existing article is likely to already have one of these sections)

To see the result of that, please look at user:chzz/demo/simpleref. Edit it, and check the code; perhaps make a test page of your own, such as user:/reftest and try it out.

 Named references 

Chzz was born in 1837. 
""""The book of Chzz"""", Aardvark Books, 2009. 
 

Chzz lives in Footown.

Note that the second usage has a / (and no closing ref tag). This needs a reference section as above; please see user:chzz/demo/namedref to see the result.

 Citation templates 

You can put anything you like between  and , but using citation templates makes for a neat, consistent look;

Chzz has 37 Olympic medals.  {{Citation
 | last = Smith
 | first = John
 | title = Olympic medal winners of the 20th century
 | publication-date = 2001
 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]
 | page = 125
 | isbn = 0-521-37169-4
}}


Please see user:chzz/demo/citeref to see the result.

For more help and tips on that subject, see user:chzz/help/refs.

This was to judge by appearances. As theoretical physicist Robert Grumbold puts it, “It took two decades of IT to reveal what the Cantab editors were really up to, but it’s now clear that their achievement was staggering. Basically if each letter of a Cantab article is plotted as a point in an n-dimensional space, then you find that the piece on the piece on Benjamin Zephaniah, written in early 1988, actually traces out an encrypted set of instructions for twisting vortical gravity fields to produce a singularity in ψ-space. And the City Issue of Summer 1988 is decades, if not centuries ahead of its time. The uninitiated were evidently deceived into seeing nothing more than a shameless piece of careerist self-aggrandizement in the hallowed Cantab tradition. “In fact”, says Grumbold “this is no less than a prototype of a 13-dimensional machine which time-locks a 9-dimensional black hole. We can see the equations but just don’t have enough neurons to even begin to figure out what they really mean”. But where was the portal and why did it have to be closed? Was it in the paste-up room cupboard? Had interdimensional creatures from another universe been progressively using it to control the minds of the film reviewers in 1985/86? Is it true that at 1.41 am on 23 May, 1988, a packet of chocolate Hobnobs on the layout desk suddenly shot across the room and disappeared into the wall? Why did so many people go into the nearby round church and so few come out? And why did so few people go into the nearby Indian restaurant and so many come out? Who or what was the Chief Editor, who subsequently disappeared in South America? Did (he) come from an extraterrestrial civilisation so advanced that trade journalism is unknown there? And why does supernatural sleuth Mike Dash repeatedly censor any attempt to tell what really went on so long ago, years after he’d left Cambridge? What is his dark secret? Had he already experienced something that has tormented him ever since and prevents him from getting a life even today? This is evidently one mystery too many, even for him….

 Use of """"America"""" when the meaning is """"United States"""" 

You are correct, that one irks me so whenever I see it I change it )

In school, the difference between America and the United States was beaten into our heads. America is two continents. The United States is one country. There is no country or nation named """"America"""". So when someone puts """"Nationality - American"""" , well, what does that tell us ? He's not European or Russian, I guess. But he she or it could be from Guatemala, Venezuela, Costa Rica, Peru or thirty other countries. The use of """"American"""" in that way is flat-out wrong. And becoming more and more common, alas !

You are correct, occasionally using 'United States' becomes very cumbersome in a sentence. As an occasionality, what the heck. But we really need to stomp on this total misuse of the name """"America"""" when people really mean """"United States.""""

 Please delete user/disc pages; warn jayron/redpen/mufka 
Hello stephen,
If you could please delete my page and page history, I'd be much obliged.

I requested speedy deletion on 1Apr for reason 1.6. jayron deleted it, then acted  as if s/he did me a favour. I feel jayron shouldnt have been the one to delete it initially as s/he  and I have negatively interacted in the past. Followups from jayron included an unneccesary block; followed by telling me to get a yahoo email so that I may contact wiki admins! 

Wiki is all about anon editing  as such I didnt and wont get an email account in order to communicate as it is not required.

Since then jayron,redpen, mufka have been repeatedly editing my page. I blank my page they restore it. This has been happening since April, so for 3months now.  I bet if I changed their pages they'd posting threats of  """"i'll report you"""" and/or """"you will be banned"""". It is quite easy for me to get a new ip address but I dont think Ive done anything wrong, so  I wont change my ip address. 

If my pages needed to be restored /reverted, I definitely think those three arent the ones who should do it as they/I have  a convoluted history.

If you could please delete my page and page history, I'd be much obliged.
If you could contact jayron, redpen, & mufka & ask that any problems they have they let an admin or arbitrator know, instread of making changes or posting to me.

The amazing thing about this show was how Melvin Lindsey was at the time. I grew up listening to it and I had no idea that Lindsey was in his early 20s when he started it.  That show was so powerful and so professional that I alway thought that Lindsey was much older. It is by far one of the most moving, rich and beautiful radio shows that I ever listened to. I am saddened also to read about Lindsey's early death. What an enormous loss.

Likewise, Catt's """"electromagnetism"""" does not pass muster. """"Displacement Current (and how to get rid of it)"""" throws up quite enough problems. Reading it critically reveals that although the article makes assertions about displacement current, the only """"real science"""" is does is to model the voltage at the source end of a transmission line as it is charged through a resistor. Since """"displacement current"""" is the prediction that a changing electric field causes a magnetic field, the only way to disprove the concept is to disprove the existence of the effect. Catt et al didn't even try to do this. It would appear that they think that because they can get to the end of the calculation without introducing """"displacement current"""" that they can say that it doesn't exist. They are in total denial of the fact that their mathematics works because it has the equations that describe a capacitor built into it.

 Mr. Rogers's Ghost 

Ghost of Mr.Rogers

I (Brittany. M) once went to my best friends house. Her name is  Jade. C. It was all fun and games for us until we kept hearing the door open and close, even the dog jumped up to see if any one was there, Jade was bringing in a dog (from outside) and saw a person shaped figure. When she came inside to tell me and her aunt that she saw someone we told her that is was probably her mom. When her mom came inside she claimed it was not her. Later her aunt was talking to Jade's great grandmother about sound horns. While that was being talked about Jades brother was talking about how people in their family was 12 years apart. Someone called at 12:12 at night (12 years apart) he said he was Fred Rogers saying he found our missing cat (on a cell phone that was abandonded, meaning no one uses) then we said we were not missing a cat then he said he was missing a brown fluffy cat. At first we thought it was someone drunk or a prank caller, but then we felt it was posessed, and we got so scared we couldn't even talk to hiim it felt like he was standing right outside our window. He asked """"If you saw Lady Elaine what would you say to her?"""" ,and """"Do you know where I could find any good horns for my train?""""(Jade's aunt and grandmother were talking about) It was too much of a couinidence to be a prank. It was no one in the house either because we were all in the kitchen. At one point we all fell on to the floor.

The only reason one would use them is that they contain claims that have not been accepted by mainstream historians.  Also, they lead us into discussions about what really happened which is a misuse of other editors' time.  We have an unsubstantiated claim by Jenny Marx made years after the event that her husband provided money for workers to buy weapons.  We do not by the way have any reliable sources that these workers obtained or used weapons in Belgium in 1848.  Reliable sources state that the French government supplied unemployed Belgian workers with weapons in Paris and these workers then returned to Belgium in an attempt to overthrow the government.  We know that Marx was arrested on suspicion of carrying arms and was ejected from the country, but in fact the accusation was false.  The types of additional sources that Martintg has provided are unreliable.  Boris Nicolaevsky for example was a communist activist (writing in 1933), not a mainstream historian.

 Pearl Buck illustrators 

Personally, I am aware of no precedents for including references to illustrators of works in the biography of the author. Such content could reasonably I think be added to the content in the bio of the illustrator, but from what little I know the author doesn't necessarily choose the illustrator, so there's not necessarily any real connection between the author per se and the illustrator. Having said all that, inclusion of such info in the articles on the books themselves makes perfect sense, and if it can be established that there was a degree of personal contact between an author and an illustrator, that could be referenced in the article too. But personally I can't see justifying the existing section in the article in question.

Ok, I added a paragraph about Native Americans and the national park. Chief Joseph's band crossing the park is perhaps the key event, but also notable is that the """"Sheepeater"""" Shoshones had been permanent residents of what became the park until leaving per a treaty (unratified), and that after the Nez Perce crossing of the park and a Bannock band entering the park in 1878, and the Sheepeater Indian War, park superintendent Norris had a fort built to make sure Indians would be prevented from entering the park (the Sheepeater War did not occur in the park but influenced Norris's decision). I'm not sure where this fort was built. These three bits of history seem important enough to include in the park's History section. Unfortunately due to the years when these things took place, the 1870s and 1880s, chronologically they fit into the subsection called """"Park creation""""and seem somewhat out of place among all the info about the early superintendents, rangers, and so on.

 Some more detail about Mormonism and constructions fundaments 

Regarding polygamism with early mormons, Joseph Smith and his first group of 12 mens were using it all the time but hidding it from their wifes... Joseph Smith was married to more than 20 womens, without the knowledge of his wife, and problems occured when this first group around him wished to make this polygamism as an official rule of their sect.

As the first wife of J. Smith was to know about her husbands several wifes, and made a scandal against it and asked for divorce, so angry she was against him, Joseph Smith changed his mind. It made J. Smith to think a little more about the problem and to make it a non legal part of their rules, which made the other male members angry at him. It end up as a polygamism rule, but first fully applied to all after Joseph Smith death. As many things in mormonism they first appeared after the foundators death, and are mostly made by its closest coworkers to assist them in gaining more power. 
It is also very well known that previously to Smiths writings about the supposed contain of its golden books, he was contacted by various members of masonics loges, and many of this church rituals, both sacred and profane, are directly taken from classical freemasonry and masonic orders'rituals. Many of the believes enumerated in the mormons books are also directly taken from those traditions, therefor the mormons books looks more, for a religions and myhtologies and esoterisms specialist point of view, like an amalguame or milk shake of several religious and sectars theories, well known within other religious groups, than a religion in itself. Nothing in the mormon books is original, all is taken from somewhere else, often with quiet a unimaginativ mind.

The mormons researchs in latin america have given zero zero zero as prooves who could elaborate anything stated in the book of mormon as a source, or even ressembling source, for all the tribes described there. 
Another correction to what some have earlier stated here: there is a hell in mormons theory. 
Only true mormon, true knights of the later days saints, and else being it since as most generations as possible, have access to heaven,(the upper part, nearest to God). The downs part being reserved to just coming in members and half fallen members. And out of it is hell, for non mormon, who cannot access the other levels, and will never been able to be in the upper levels. It is clearly stated in the mormons teaching, and I heard it several times, by mormons priests, that there is no salvation for non mormon. Christian go to hell too, and none of the christian priests are recognized as such, nor are they aknowledge the power to baptise anyone, and they teach that even the first apostles, those walking around Jesus Christ, were not able to baptise others and that it is therefor their power was stopped there, until Jesus christ himself took to latin america, and baptised a bunch of by mistake-landed-there-hebrews, and later on this power was given by Christ and Moises itself to Joseph Smith. 
And thats the way the story goes.

The foundator of the christian church is by definition unable to baptise others. Peter was spiritually impotent if we are to believe the mormonic song. 
A way one can undoubtly see the influence of freemasonry in the mormon church is their attribution of 1st and second degree of priesthood, like a copy-paste of hebraic traditions, with some dubious change into it. 
You are missing here also, the place of womens in the mormon church where political reasons, clearly prevail: It is for exemple today teached, that the upper god, is a goddess, the wife of God, and higher than him, and that she cant be named, and very little is known about her because she is OH! so high and special. It is also teached that the reason why women cannot be priest nor teach like priest, nor baptised, is that women are per birth closer to god than men, and that is therefor men only must try to come closer to god by manifesting their spirituality from an early age, all things a woman do not need to do as she has it all to begin with... It is also teach that men must fight harder to attain the same spiritual level as women have, and thats why women must do other things in the mean time: like give birth to more mormons members, do the cleaning and make food, and play missionary 1½ year of their life just before getting married, as soon as they return from mission time. All that good propaganda methods to secure the upcoming of new female members in that order, as well as keeping the youngsters in the old sheme of things, without risking having them asking certain questions, very up to date, very warms, and never answered by this church. 
There is of course nowhere in the mormon books where anyone could actually read exactly the thing stated above, but the",0,0,0,0,0,0

For example the reference you put are biased on one openion and in one direction that is Anti Ahmadiyya websites. How can some one claim that the material which is published on Ahmaiyya site is edited..even if it is edited to suit something, we must accept it as an Official point of view of a community, we dont have to agree with it, but we have to accept it as Official point of view. So if you put some information from an Anti Ahmadiyya web site it will be biased as on the official web site you dont find this information, the best informaiton will be if we can match this information on both sides, other wise, regardless true or false, it will remain Biased and that is against the Policy of Wikipedia. That is why i have suggested earlier that there is no restriction on puting information on open plate form like Wikipedia, but instead of puting on this artical there are other artical where this information can be put it. For example, there are Artical like Islam and Quran, but Critism on Islam is a totally different Artical, so the Islam Poisition is defined in Islam Artical, but Critism was defined in other Artical. If a Bio Artical like Mirza Ghulam Ahmad is a Bio Artical, the Critism or his so called failed Prophecies, will not suit for this Artical. You can even creat a new Artical more suitable to the title and information against him or his Community. This will be more sources, more reliable and athenticated rather called Biased and may be reverted repeatedly.

For reference I quote (with added emphasis) from Wikipedia:Five pillars about WP:NPOV:
Wikipedia has a neutral point of view, which means we strive for articles that advocate no single point of view. Sometimes this requires representing multiple points of view; presenting each point of view accurately; providing context for any given point of view, so that readers understand whose view the point represents; and presenting no one point of view as """"the truth"""" or """"the best view"""". It means citing verifiable, authoritative sources whenever possible, especially on controversial topics.

However, on closer inspection, I would be willing to bet that a judge or jury would find that I am arguing on the merits of the Wiki-policies and outside sources, while JJB is using scorched-Earth tactics. Please consider this example:

    The evidence does not favor backing off from requesting a move, for compliance's sake, in some other polite way. First, the """"vote"""" remains 6-4 by my count: no consensus. Second, your unsourced statement of thousands of """"longevity myths"""" cites is probably a Google exaggeration based on estimated mirrors; see above where I sourced the real numbers as 92 vs. 91. Third, this exaggeration only reflects the fact that a vast number of """"myth"""" mirrors stem from Ryoung's wholly unsourced 2005 insertions. (The User:Shii/Hoaxes page normally considers this as evidence of hoaxing. See User talk:Shii/Hoaxes#Longevity, ticklish situation for 26 phrases originating from Ryoung that have exactly zero Google support outside his 2005 insertions.)

            Yet another FALSE accusation. There is no """"hoaxing"""" here at all, nor has there been any attempt at """"hoaxing."""" I am not responsible for third-party sites, but if they choose to copy my work, might it be because they consider it a reliable source?Ryoung122 

                Comment: Looking closer, we see that it was JJB that listed this as a """"hoax"""":

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Shii/Hoaxes#Longevity.2C_ticklish_situation

Citation of one's own accusation is a circular argument, and thus invalid.

In other words, JJBulten first adds material to Shi's page then cites his own add as """"proof"""" of hoaxing. Actually, it's only proof of his fanaticism, of hitting 'below the belt' in an attempt to radically remake this page in his own image. """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Notice to vandalizing halfwits, linkspammers, and people who don't read WP:NOT

Before you sit down and construct a series of vandalizations to this page, or whine about the article I put a CSD tag on, or my AfD vote, you should be informed that your world orbits a ball of fire. This ball of deadly heat is paradoxically far enough away that it actually provides some level of benefit to those who spend a measured amount of time in front of it. While you should not in any way stare at it, a respectful glance in its direction will show you that it is warm and in some ways healthy. 

Accompanying the ball of fire is a collection of variant photosensitive lifeforms and constantly recycled breathing material, suitable for your use at any time you so please, and containing life-giving elements. As an added bonus, most of these materials are available to you entirely for free and 24 hours a day. 

We encourage you to cease vandalizing or whining on this page and get to know the magic ball of fire.

Credit to User:Elaragirl for the above

Disclaimer: The above is intended as a humorous way to emphasize a point. If you are not humorous, feel free to continue to be a halfwit or linkspammer, or both if you prefer. You may also ignore the fiery ball, if you so please, however I warn you that without it, you would never have been permitted to enjoy linkspamming or halfwittedness or ignorance of WP:NOT.

 List of products in The Simpsons 

Hello George. I see you've been actively making additions to List of products in The Simpsons. It is good that you're enthusiastic about the list. However, I would like to suggest that you might be going a bit overboard. There are literally thousands of products and stores in The Simpsons that are seeing in single shots as throwaway jokes, etc. If one were to list them all, the list would be fairly bulky and useless (this has happened on other Simpsons lists already and have had to be cut back). I'd like to suggest the following guidelines:
Stores aren't products, so I would suggest you not list stores such as """"Herman's Military Antiques"""".
Bulk groups of products like the """"many antiques at Herman's Military Antiques"""".
Do not include real-world products like """"English Muffins"""". If you do that, it's pointless. Everything in the house is a product. TVs, couches, drapes, carpet, etc. Besides which, I would argue that noone in the world would ever need to look up whether English muffins are sold on the Simpsons. Real world products are assumed to exist on the show since it is rarely shown otherwise.
The list should really be for Simpsons-invented brand-names or invented products.

The next issue is subjective, but I believe crucial to keeping the list from spiraling out of control:
Products on the list should only be included if they are used more than once on the show. Throwaway jokes like Itchy & Scratchy Land Personalised License Plates are basically just describing a joke on the show. The list is really designed more for things like Laramie cigarettes, squishys and things that make up the Simpsons lore than a list of throwaway jokes. That doesn't mean some of your edits aren't perfect for the list; I believe you added """"Radioactive Man Comics"""", """"The Springfield Shopper"""" and """"Li'l Bastard Kits"""". These are great ones, but things like """"Disemboweller IV"""" needn't be included.

I am going to be deleting some of the ones that fall into the bullet point list above (real-world items and bulk groups) but I'm not going to immediately delete single-appearance items, but I suggest you join a discussion at Wikipedia talk:WikiProject The Simpsons#List of products in The Simpsons.

Adult Film Career Revision Proposal

This paragraph needs editing.  It has several problems

 Moving to Germany had nothing to do with Adult films.
 This sentence is superflous:  """"Other films included Man to Men and Jawbreaker.""""
 This sentence seems to be selling the films or gratuitously promoting them. """"Scenes from some films have been re-released as part of compilations which is common in the porn industry. The compilation Touched by an Anal was released in 1997; a more recent release was in 2006, Mansex Meltdown.""""
 This sentence has nothing to do with the Adult Film Career heading: """"Though he has appeared in gay and bisexual porn films, Sanchez identifies as heterosexual and has stated that he has had no homosexual contact since joining the Corps in 2003.""""

Re-write for Adult Career 2.0

So, we could re-write:

In the early 1990's, Matt Sanchez lived in Montreal, Canada where he worked in the adult entertainment industry in all-male films for prominent directors John Rutherford and Kristen Bjorn and Chi Chi Larue at the studios Bijou, Catalina and Falcon Video.  For French-speaking films, he used the stage name Pierre LaBranche, but all of his titles in the United States were under Rod Majors.   

During his career, Sanchez stared in several award-winning adult films including Call of the Wild, Jawbreaker and Idol Country co-starring Ryan Idol and Marco Rossi. 

Scenes from many films have recently been re-released as part of compilations; Sanchez stated in an interview with Radar Magazine that it """"was just the nature of the business, you shoot a lot of films and they use them forever."""" Sanchez later wrote, """"In porn, everything taboo is trivialized and everything trivial is magnified.""""

7237be43cb786baf,"""::I am surprised you dispute whether or not the Analects contain music criticism when this is so widely written about. Your criticism of Steben’s 2010 paper, “The Philosophy of Music and Ritual in Pre-Han Confucian Thought” http://www.academia.edu/1929545/The_Philosophy_of_Music_and_Ritual_in_Pre-Han_Confucian_Thought_Exalting_the_Power_of_Music_in_Human_Life) for not using the word “criticism” is as unsupportable as your insistence on the word “theory.” Lest we devolve into absurd arguments about the definition of “criticism,” In general, the word is defined as “The action of criticizing, or passing judgment on the qualities or merits of anything….” (The Philological Society, ed. The Oxford English Dictionary, Vol II C, Oxford at the Clarendon Press, 1970, p.1181). With regard to music specifically, “The Oxford Companion to Music” defines it, in specific regard to music, as: “…the intellectual activity of formulating judgments on the value and degree of excellence of individual works of music, or whole groups or genres.”(Latham, ed. Oxford University Press, 2002, p.324) Steben’s paper then clearly describes Confucius’ criticism. As another example, WP’s article on Yayue refers to Confucius’ writing: “The term yayue itself first appeared in the Analects,[2][3] where yayue was considered by Confucius to be the kind of music that is good and beneficial, in contrast to the popular music originated from the state of Zheng which he judged to be decadent and corrupting.[4][5] Yayue is therefore regarded in the Confucian system as the proper form of music that is refined, improving, and essential for self-cultivation, and one that can symbolize good and stable governance.[6][7] “ The Analects contain music criticism whether the word “criticism” appears or not. I think you may be the only person around who thinks otherwise.

 New 2012 study by Mark Regnerus, sociology professor at the University of Texas 

A new study conducted by Mark Regnerus, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas has revealed, among other things, that 40% of children (aged 18 to 39) whose parents are homosexual have had an affair while married or cohabiting, compared to only 13% of children from heterosexual families. It also showed that 23% of children whose parents are lesbian or gay have been touched sexually by a parent or an adult, compared to 2% of children from heterosexual families, and that 31% of them have had sex against their will, compared to 8% from heterosexual families. The study stresses, however, that it would be wrong to conclude from its data that the abuser was necessarily one of the parents, or that the abuse had anything to do with the parent's sexual orientation. The study also shows that 12% of those with lesbian parents and 24% of those with homosexual fathers have considered suicide, compared to 5% of those from heterosexual families. Children with homosexual parents are also more than twice as likely to be in therapy """"for a problem connected with anxiety, depression or relationships"""" - 19% of children compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Furthermore, 20% of children with lesbian parents and 25% of children with homosexual fathers have had a sexually transmitted disease, compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. 28% of children with lesbian parents and 20% of children with homosexual fathers are currently unemployed compared to 8% of children from heterosexual families. Adult children with homosexual parents are also more likely to smoke marijuana and to get arrested.

Due to the findings, it is very controversial, and that is why my edit here: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Homosexuality_and_psychology&diff;=497579176&oldid;=497039907 and here: http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=LGBT_parenting&diff;=497585303&oldid;=497583187 has been undone, simply because another user disagreed and claimed the study is: """"widely criticized and flawed."""" Criticized by whom? It is a new study, nobody had yet written an article debunking it. Flawed according to whom? Your personal opinion? That is not a reason to vandalise the article and undo my edit.

The study is published and available here: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0049089X12000610

There is no valid, honest, objective reason to remove this information from the article, yet I was forced to open a """"talk"""" about it because of no other reason than somebody not liking the results of the study. This is unacceptable, yet here I am anyway, opening a """"talk"""" about it. So, what is there to discuss? Your opinion disagreeing with the results?

She gave conflicting evidence over when she took the photos, but as far as I know, she didn't initially deny she took the photos. (I will double-check this) But her initial testimony to the FBI closely matches what she told the WC several months later. She later said that the photos were taken a bit later (not late Feb- early Mar 1963 as she told the FBI/WC, but late Mar/early Apr), which fits in with other evidence. Most importantly, she maintains to this day - even as she now thinks her husband was not responsible for the assassination - that she indeed took the photos.

You think PSP Wiki is have trusted sources? Its copy of Wikipedia and users are adding information not Sony.  
In PSP Wiki is written: The latest reported firmware version shipping pre-installed on new PSPs is 5.50 (confirmed by a few people who buyed a PSP-3000 Special Edition (Harry Potter Version).   
This have trusted sources???: (confirmed by a few people who buyed a PSP-3000 Special Edition (Harry Potter Version)?? OH YES SONY CONFIRMED THAT!!! OR WHAT?? [and even world bought is written wrong]  
Actually a new PSPs have a version 5.70 or higher. Even in Wikipedia is written: [5.70]This firmware is only available pre-installed on new PSP-N1000 (PSPgo) models and cannot be downloaded. SO ARE YOU BLIND OR WHAT???!!! AND HOW CAN BE THIS POSTED IF IT DOESN'T HAVE SOURCE?  
And 5.70 is also installed on new PSPs 3000. I can confirm that. On PSPs came with limited edition GT bundle. I bought one.(already sold it because its not hackable)

Underage children are children beneath the legal age of consent (different states have 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 as the underage limit. Children in most countries means someone under the age of 18. In Ireland for example, a 'child' aged 17 is over the age of consent. In Britain it is 16. Do you know the first thing about the topic? 

The name is standard english asage. Scandal is a POV term. Allegation allows the discussion of cases that have not yet come to court, which cannot for technical reasons be prosecuted and cases that were thrown up as invalid. Roman Catholic Church sex abuses allegations in standard english means allegations about the Roman Catholic Church. 

Public relations is minor tabloid point when you are discussing the rape of children, so stop adding in an irrelevant topic.

a43a5be8a17eb6a4,"Please stop vandalising my writings in the dog article 

Nothing in my writing here is controvertial and in need of citation. It can all be looked up by the reader on any level. Do you need citations that dogs did not decend thousands of years ago from the wolves that are alive today, as most people believe? Do I need proof that they decended thousands of years ago from the wolves that LIVED thousands of years ago? Why does this need citation? Is this your problem? I am merely pointing out the error that so many, many people make. They hear that dogs decended from wolves, and they look around and see the only wolves left in the world in any number today are the wolves of northern lattitudes...they see the grey wolf of northern Eursaia and the timber wolf of North America, and believe that all dogs decended from them. Humans are a tropical creature that moved into the colder regions. Everywhere man goes, wolf populations dwindle, as anybody knows, and in ancient times, before man, there were wolves all over the world, adapted to their own climates. What part of this needs citation? Obviously, the first dogs to be bred were the ones where the people first lived, which is obviously the warmer climates, and it was THESE wolves that gave rise to most of our dog breeds, not the northern wolves. Now the wolves of the colder regions are the only ones left in number, the wolves in warmer places, where dogs were first bred, are almost all gone. Some northern breeds decended from northern wolves, yes. The spitz breeds and sled dogs, etc. This is all so obviuous, can you tell me what part of this you don't understand, and need citations about? I feel like I am talking to a child. If I tell my child that George Washington was the first president, to I have to give a citation? This stuff doesn't need citation.

You are a vandal, because you, as the only person on earth who doesn't agree with this, erased three whole paragraphs, not once but twice, on the grounds that there were no references, even though much larger tracts of the article are more controvertial and have no citations. You erased every word I wrote, even though all of it is true, none of it is controversial, and this is nothing but pure vandalism.

You need citation that dogs interbreed with coyotes? Why? How can you not already know that? How is this possible? And articles about the Russian jackal-dog hybrid are all over the web. Can you use a search engine? Look up the pre-caudal gland in any veterinary text. Things that are controvertial or new need citations to the new or controvertial sources, but when something become so widely-known that it can be found in every reference work out there, it no longer needs specific citation. For anything I wrote, you can look it up in Britannica. If you read something that you did not know, it doesn't mean the author needs to cite references for you, it just means you need to do your own homework. I am merely pointing out the things that are such a big part of common knowledge, and using them to prove that dogs did not all decend entirely from modern wolves of the colder climate where people didn't even live when dogs were first domesticated. In all my years of veterinary practice, I have probably told 100's of my patients that dogs decended from warm-climate wolves, NOT all of them come from the northern wolves. Now, after all these years, I am confronted by a web vandal who tells me I have to cite freaking references about this. It is purely annoying. 

If you erase my writings again I will report you as a vandal. Really, do NOT do it again.

It is not without a reason Telugu script has been linked to old-Kannada script. It has been well documented by many scholars and in many books. It is also widely accepted by Telugu ppl as well.

OTHERWISE;  you have to show immediate references or supporting articles, proofs etc. I would like to receive those proofs, if this is really a documented proof, I very much would like to read them.  
PLEASE REFER TO SOME RESPECTED ENCYCLOPEDIA LIKE BRITTANICA ABOUT THE SO-CALLED ARMENIAN GENOCIDE, TO SEE WHAT NEUTRALITY REALLY MEANS !

No academic research , conducted in Turkish Republic, ever denies the fact that """"MANY"""" Armenians were killed during the relocation but """"A MILLION"""" IS REALLY A BAD EXAGGERATE.

Just because there are some PUNKS ( Do they call themselves System of Something? ) who make their homeland's propaganda, does not mean that you can falsify the history.

Well, dear Ahasuerus: It is actually difficult to edit any page in Wikipedia without Muslims jumping at you and trying to censor you with all sorts of excuses. You must understand that the freedom of speech for Muslims is an alien concept. In Islamic countries if you say something against Islam they kill you. Where they can't kill you, they censor you. Wikipedia seems to be dominated by Muslims. This of course is not true in all the pages where Muslims have no interest, but when the interest of Islam comes in, they can be quite bullish in making their word prevail. But that is another story. This article started with some explanation like this:

In recent years especially after the 9/11 some observers, including Muslim dissidents have stated that Islam presents a threat bigger than Nazism not to just the Western world but to all non-Islamic countries. They have labeled those who defend Islam and try to be politically correct about it, the today’s useful idiots. 

[Ali Sina] states: “They are idiots because they speak without knowledge of Islam and its threat to mankind and they are useful to the Islamists with whose help they can penetrate the non-Muslim countries and destroy them from within.”  The same author writes: “More abhorrent than war is making peace with evil. In the words of the 18th Century British parliamentarian Edmund Burke, """"All that is necessary for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing."""" Those who advocate peace with Islam are idiots of this century. If we do not stand against Islam it will grow and then billions will die. Trying to appease Muslims is foolish. It is informed by ignorance of Islam. Most cancers are treatable, if detected in time. But if ignored, they will grow to a stage that will kill you. Today we have the choice. We can either fight Islam and extirpate it before it threatens our existence or wait and face the apocalypses.” 

Muslims obviously don't like Ali Sina. For some reason anything you post here from him they will delete at once. So the above passage that explained the concept was deleted. The administrator SlimVirgin despite claiming impartiality, has yet to show that in actions. I could be wrong but for reasons that I explained to her, I have still to be convinced of that claim. I found out that she is Iranian, like Ali Sina, but of course most Iranians are still Muslims. She even once tried to discredit Ali Sina saying that he is Islamophobic. Obviously she sees genuine criticism of Islam unwarranted and interprets that as Islamophobia. My judgement about her is just based on my first impression and I could be wrong. I have explained to her my concern about her impartiality already and I hope she will eventually show I had misjudged her. 

In Wikipedia there is a lot of Islamic propaganda which are not true at all, but generally critical views about Islam do not survive. Why? If Wikipedia is impartial shouldn’t we give equal space to both sides? Would we accept if e.g. scientologist or any other cultists try to take over the Wikipedia and disallow any criticism of their cult? What is happening is very disturbing. There are hundreds of pages in Wikipedia that are misleading because they are edited and controlled by Muslims and as soon as you try to post anything showing the other side of the coin they revert it and even call your contribution “hate speech”. What about the Quran? Isn’t that book a hate speech?  

Funny thing is that they throw at you the basic rules of Wikipedia when in reality it is they who constanly breach those rules. 

If you try to write anything that Muslims don’t like they will delete it with invalid justifications. This is a very disturbing trend. For example the quotes of Ali Sina were removed because, as they said, he is not notable. There are 200,000 pages talking about faith freedom international. There have been death threats in Islamic sites against him, there are a few Islamic sites created just to refute him. Doesn’t all that say that he is notable at least to be quoted? Finally if he is notable enough to have a page in Wikipedia why his quotes should not be published? 

I am not familiar with the structure of Wikipedia, but I suppose there must be some committee that would check into complaints. (All I am hoping is that this committee is not already taken over by Islamists)  Is there a forum where important questions such as the direction Wikipedia is taking is discussed? 

Sorry, this subject might have not belonged to this page but these are things I would like to discuss. Is there a place to do that?  My point is that if Wikipedia loses its impartiality and becomes the guardian angel of a certain cult or religion, it loses its credibility fast.  05:13 2",0,0,0,0,0,1
