Handle in text:  It is not clear exactly what the alternative  to this RFC proposal is, or what a """"no"""" or """"yes"""" might yield,  so I will spell out what I see here as the best solution. I agree with Gamaliel and Nomoskedasticity that this is a BLP issue and that using """"Filipino"""" alone is utterly unacceptable and POV.   I do think """"Filipino-American"""" correctly describes the subject of the article, and is not an indication of citizenship, but rather it is a demographic description which could accurately be used.  However,  per TheRedPenOfDoom, and MarkBernstein, I think that this may be best handled as Bbb23 and Seb suggested - and how the lead is now worded - which is to not use either identifier in the first sentence, but instead unpack it, spell out in more detail the actual facts in an NPOV manner, in the lead and in the rest of the article which the intro summarizes.  This works and does not take sides in the serious BLP issue.  We further make clear how Vargas self-identifies, which I think is important here, without having Wikipedia editors take a position. As MarkBernstein said, we are not required to indicate nationality or citizenship in the first sentence or anywhere, and TRPoD is right about disclaimers etc.  -sometimes it is best to go at it from a different angle. We also had the same kind of issue at - believe it or not - Bee Gees where there were warring factions who disagreed about whether they should be called English, Australian, or Manx; we handled it by leaving off the nationality, and the wars stopped.   So, I support this wording: Jose Antonio Vargas (born February 3, 1981) is a journalist, filmmaker, and immigration activist.

Well that is not correct. If you are unwilling to learn the difference between in-universe and out-universe then I think editing articles dealing with fictional characters is not fair on editors who actually bothered to. The problem is the date of death field is part of the personal profile section of the info box. This means it is an in-universe element of the article; referring exclusively to events within the series. If the episode was set on a different date, to that it aired on - then a death featured within that episode would carry the date within the series. Fictional characters do not die from our viewpoint - they will always exist, they do not cease to exist, so we do not use our date. So maybe you need to have a rethink.

""""Her dissertation involved the development of an experimental method to measure thermal stresses in bimaterial joints. She has taught courses including Experimental Stress Analysis, Engineering Mechanics, Mechanics of Materials (Strength of Materials), Strength of Materials Testing. From 1999 to 2006 Dr. Wood has been an assistant professor in the Mechanical Engineering Department at Clemson University in Clemson, South Carolina. Before moving to Clemson she spent three years as a postdoctoral research associate in the Department of Engineering Science and Mechanics at Virginia Tech. Dr. Wood is currently writing a book with Morgan Reynolds on the physical evidence explaining the events on 9/11. One of Dr. Wood’s research interests is biomimicry, or applying the mechanical structures of biological materials to engineering design using engineering materials. Other recent research has investigated the deformation behavior of materials and structures with complex geometries and complex material properties, such as fiber-reinforced composite materials and biological materials. Dr. Wood is an expert in the use of moiré interferometry, a full-field optical method that is used in stress analysis. Dr. Wood has over 60 technical publications in refereed journals, conference proceedings, and edited monographs and special technical reports. Dr. Wood started to question the events of 9/11 on that same day when what she saw and heard on television was contradictory and appeared to violate the laws of physics. Since that day she has used her knowledge of engineering mechanics to prove that the collapse of the World Trade Center twin towers could not have happened as the American public was told.

Simon Baron-Cohen image

Very kindly provided by Simon Baron-Cohen, who is nice he even ran down the photographer for permission. It is Non-free but with permission for fair use.

Image can be resized, moved, cropped and upload as second image (with same permissions) whatever, but thought I'd better pop it up before it gets deleted as an orphan.  

 It's not an orphan, since Simon Baron-Cohen points at it. I'd really rather not have this image in Asperger syndrome, for reasons already discussed. This article already highlights SBC's theories too much, at the expense of other theories that are just as respectable; including his image and omitting other eminent contemporary researchers make the article look more like a puff piece than it did already.  

He actually gave it for this article, so let's try and see what the consensus is? There is no reason why you shouldn't get images of other """"eminent contemporary researchers"""" as well to balance?  
Other editors, such as SandyGeorge, have complained about a lack of images in this article. Delete this one and there is only one small image of Asperger. Zeraeph is right, get more images to balance it, don't just delete.  

Getting more images of other eminent researchers would """"balance"""" the article only in that it would be better to have images of Ehlers, Frith, Gillberg, Happé, Klin, Ozonoff, Rogers, Volkmar, Wing, etc., than having just Baron-Cohen. But this would be changing the article in the wrong direction (not to mention being a source of further disputes). Asperger syndrome should focus on AS, not on AS researchers. With the exception of Asperger himself and maybe Wing, who were instrumental in the history of the disorder, the other researchers just don't make the cut. Rather than head in this direction, the article would be better off stealing the images from Autism. If you take a look at the images in Autism, all but one are far more relevant to AS than this image of Baron-Cohen is.  

I agree with Eubulides. SBC is already over-represented, and the suggestion of increasing focus on the researchers themselves is unnecessary. Maybe a secondary linked article could be created for a 'who's who gallery' of AS researchers (for those attached to this idea).  

I agree with Eubulides and Soulgany101.  Yes, we need images, and there are images that could be used to illustrate AS; SBC isn't one of them, and gives undue weight to one researcher's views.  His image should be used in his article, where anyone curious about him can find it (but the right hand side shoulod be cropped off).   (Talk) 01:""",0,0,0,0,0,0

The units of this accounting system would be known as Energy CertificatesThese would replace money in a Technate, but unlike traditional money or currencies, energy certificates could not be saved or earned, only distributed evenly among a populace. The amount of certificates given to each citizen would be calculated by determining the total productive capacity of the technate and dividing it equally. The Energy Certificates themselves would probably not have to be physically used by the populace, as the system would be computerised. In energy accounting the Technate would use information of Natural resources, industrial capacity and citizen’s purchasing habits to determine how much of any good or service was being consumed by the populace, so that it could match production with consumption.

The reason for the use of Energy Accounting serves to ensure the highest possible standard of living as well as equality among the Technate’s citizenry, as well as prohibit spending that is beyond the productive capacity of the technocracy.Energy Accounting An article on Energy Accounting as proposed by Technocracy Inc.

""""Rescatamos esta bandera para todos"""" was the one that wanted the nacionalista quiet and quieto. I was reading las Tribulaciones de Joana de Jose Luis Gonzalez, he said that Muñoz told him that the Puerto Rican in the US by the second genenation would not be Puerto Rican , but his was wrong, we Puerto Rican in exile we still Puerto Rican. i went to la isla del vacilon to see my grandmother die. Been in the hospital in the island, you are reminded that we are third world country, Puerto Rico is not mainstream America. Puerto Rico is latin American, culpa de los vagancia Española. Que viva la siesta! I walk into the emergency room in Santurce, Tony it was like a nightmare, people en camillas in the hallway, el aire acondicianodao no funcionaba, y las enfermeras estaban en break. But Puerto Rico es un vacilon y un tapon, people are happy an unemployed. Agueybana is far, far away, Betances is just mural en la UPR. La estadidad is not coming any time soon. Esta en lista de espera. 

Dont worry, how  may people have the article Juan Alejo de Arizmendi in their watchlist? Right now, Im not editing, Im still enjoying El Don Q bottles that I bought in the San Juan airport. Puerto Rico es un vacilon. this engineer from el Colegio de Mayaguez is drunk, because his grandmother died. Did you that 42270 gallons went to waste last week in the city and that the supervising engineer went missing, I for the first time  didnt care. Officially taking a leave of absence for a month. Tony, dont tell me about Muñoz, quizas un indepedesitanta como yo, que se quedo callado, porque se enamoro de una gringa. I live in the subur, drive an upper class car, I am actor como una telenovela de telemundo, I am Muñoz enamorado de las cosas gringas pero soñando con indepedencia, y escuachando salsa mientras trabajo en una oficina . Tony , I confess I am puerto rican living the american dream.  but also dreaming about Agueybana, also running the streets of Jayuya and listening to Blanca Canales. Please write more, about Puerto Ricans fighting in World War II, Purto Rican working for NASA, puerto Ricans being the best, of the best. keep the spirit of Agueybana alive, he in the front of the line, easy target of el arquebuz, keep the spirtit alive, tell me something about Muñoz, tell me something about Albizu, but please dont be quiet, tell me anything that keep me believing in our island.

Expanding claims of mistreatment with other witnesses
29-Apr-2010: It is time to greatly expand the section about Claims of Mistreatment, to include numerous other sources. Originally, that section was quickly created to begin the topic. At first, the issue was treated as a """"he said she said"""" dispute (when there are no other witnesses than just the 2 sides making claims). However, now, there are probably 10 or 15 witnesses to add into that section, including:
 In June 2009, Knox testified they repeatedly asked, """"Did you hear Meredith scream?"""" and she replied no, no, and no. When they insisted how was that possible, she claims that she said, """"I don't know; perhaps I had my fingers in my ears."""" That became: """"Knox put her fingers in her ears when she heard Kercher screaming"""" (invented false confession).
 Knox's father attended those trial hearings and he confirmed her statements as consistent with his conversations with Amanda, for years.
 Knox's father stated that a female officer linked to hitting Knox was charged with beating another suspect.
 One of the police officers (from that night) testified that Knox was so pressured during the intense interrogation that she starting screaming (not hearsay).
 Patrik L. (Knox's boss at the pub Le Chic) stated that he was also pressured and threatened by police officers on the same day.
 Author Douglas Preston, in several reports, has stated that he was also pressured and threatened by the same prosecutor, and commented about that in relation to Knox's testimony.
All such statements are allowed, per Wikipedia policies, because they are not WP:SYN synthesis, but rather reported in single sources describing the claims of mistreatment. The current text of the section must be expanded per WP:NOTCENSORED and WP:NOTPAPER. Expect the article to exceed 200kb, when similar basic details have been added. -  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

NPOV editing
By the grace of G-d
Greetings and blessings. 
I have edited the links section to add few Mashichist sites to give a greater range  of Chabad views on the issue of identity of Moshiach and the proccess of redemption. While I realize Wikipedia is not a link list I feel that all those sites should be included. I have also moved the """"Breif history of Chabad Messianism""""  to the historical sites section from it's original location in the Chabad Messianic sites section since it's not a Mashichist propaganda, but
 the author of the article simply presents an overview of the development of the Moshiach identification campaign within Chabad and further states elsewhere on his site that he doesn't believe the Rebbe is Moshiach therefore it obviously doesn't belong in the Chabad Messianic sites section.
I have also added the http://www.YudelKrinsky.com as satire is just another way to convey information and studying it creates a clearer picture about the issue in the mind of a serious Wikipedia reader.

It doesn't stop here, for me at least, I'm going to keep up with improving the quality of the GAs and look for more FA opportunities.

You should, perhaps, check out the articles from the U.S. Dept of State. There is one on human rights in DK and one on religious freedom. This is factual, academic work, and it is far more damning that anything I have written (yet). I will soon be incorporating some of these new findings provided by the U.S. Dept of State and the U.S. Ambassador to DK into this Wikipedia article.

If DK has a policy of religious freedom, yet officially have a program of harassing immigrants, that will not gain any favor in terms of international relations. It is virtually impossible to have an article that is factual and also presents a view that the Danes are victims of Muslim invaders, because the facts do not support this.

 WP:OUTING 

Any edit that """"outs"""" someone must be reverted promptly, followed by a request for Oversight to delete that edit from Wikipedia permanently, Unless unintentional and non-malicious (for example, where Wikipedians know each other off-site and may inadvertently post personal information, such as using the other person's real name in discussions), attempted outing is grounds for an immediate block.

Shortcuts:
WP:OUTING
WP:PRIVACY
""""WP:OUTING"""" redirects here. For the alternate meaning of outing, as in excursion, see Wikipedia:Meetup.
For the Wikimedia privacy policy, see Wikimedia:Privacy policy.
Posting another editor's personal information is harassment, unless that person voluntarily had posted his or her own information, or links to such information, on Wikipedia. Personal information includes legal name, date of birth, identification numbers, home or workplace address, job title and work organisation, telephone number, email address, or other contact information, whether any such information is accurate or not. Posting such information about another editor is an unjustifiable and uninvited invasion of privacy and may place that editor at risk of harm outside of their activities on Wikipedia. This applies to the personal information of both editors and non-editors. It also applies in the case of an editor who has requested a change in username, but whose old identifying marks can still be found. Any edit that """"outs"""" someone must be reverted promptly, followed by a request for Oversight to delete that edit from Wikipedia permanently. If an editor has previously posted their own personal information but later redacted it, it should not be repeated on Wikipedia; although references to still-existing, self-disclosed information is not considered outing. If the previously posted information has been removed by Oversight, then repeating it on Wikipedia is considered outing.

The fact that a person either has posted personal information or edits under their own name, making them easily identifiable through online searches, is not an excuse for """"opposition research"""". Dredging up their off line opinions to be used to constantly challenge their edits can be a form of harassment, just as doing so regarding their past edits on other Wikipedia articles may be. However, if individuals have identified themselves without redacting or having it oversighted, such information can be used for discussions of conflict of interest in appropriate forums. If redacted or oversighted personally identifying material is important to the COI discussion, then it should be emailed privately to an administrator or arbitrator – but not repeated on Wikipedia: it will be sufficient to say that the editor in question has a COI and the information has been emailed to the appropriate administrative authority.

If you see an editor post personal information about another person, do not confirm or deny the accuracy of the information. Doing so would give the person posting the information and anyone else who saw the page feedback on the accuracy of the material. Do not treat incorrect attempts at outing any differently from correct attempts for the same reason. When reporting an attempted outing take care not to comment on the accuracy of the information. Outing should usually be described as """"an attempted outing"""" or similar, to make it clear that the information may or may not be true, and it should be made clear to the users blocked for outing that the block log and notice does not confirm the information.

Unless unintentional and non-malicious (for example, where Wikipedians know each other off-site and may inadvertently post personal information, such as using the other person's real name in discussions), attempted outing is grounds for an immediate block.

Threats to out an editor will be treated as a personal attack and dealt with accordingly.  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

""""Self-hating Jew"""" is with very rare exception used as an epithet only. It is very rarely used to legitimately describe an actual condition. I can cite thousands of instances of its use as an epithet; I suspect that one would be hard-pressed to come up with even a dozen examples of its legitimate use. Jfdwolff changed the introduction to include the word """"epithet,"""" so maybe NPOV is not what you think it is in this case.
I understand that there is a history of Jews hiding or otherwise denying or betraying their ethnicity/religion. But """"self-hating Jew"""" is hardly a sympathetic term to describe such a person. Even by Prof. Gilman's position as given in the article, the term arose out of a dispute between different Jewish groups: an epithet. If you met someone who was genuinely distressed about his Jewish identity to the point that he tried to hide or deny it, would you call him a self-hating Jew? I think that would be very cruel; something worse even than calling a handicapped person a """"cripple.""""

If there is one thing worse than a knowitall, it's a smug knowitall.  Unfortunately, you are wrong yet again.  I may have been deleted from the first place it was put, but it is allive and well where it ended up (just checked - still there).  And the diffs are where I put them as well.  The subsequent e-mail discussion shows it was taken seriously.  Basically your card has been marked.  I never expected Wikipedia admin to do anything much as they never usually do.

At least you are self confessed knowitall since you stated publically that you delete material where it conflicts with you own knowledge (with, of course, the classic hallmark of the knowitall - the anonuymous reference book).  In my experience, and I have no doubt that is considerably greater than yours, knowitalls rarely know very much about anything.  

Oh, and by the way: the book 'Railway Signalling on British Railways' by Richard Knedham AFIRSE (That's Associate Fellow of the Institute of Railway Signalling Engineers to you - and thus, I am certain, more highly qualified than an anorak such as youreslf.) says that you are wrong (yet again!) about the tokenless block (which incidentally was not my edit).  He states that the tokenless block has become a generic term for any single track system where the driver does not take possession of a physical token.

Oh and your sockpuppetry allegation got treated with the contempt that it deserved - not helped when you tried to claim evidence that was actually supplied by yourself.

Biochemistry Vandalism
PLEASE if you are not sure about something please discuss it here. Steroids include phytosterols. Phytosterols are not derived from cholesterol otherwise all vegan people would be in deep trouble ). In general there is a tendency to write comments from a human perspective. Please remember that compounds are found throughout nature and span many living organisms. That said I removed the anonymous person's comments that all steroids come from cholesterol, who he removed my previous comments on the HMG-CoA pathway. I added lanosterol and squalene instead.

 corticosteroid v. anabolic steroid 

Canof steroid hormones that are genericly refered to as """"steroids"""" by different groups (corticosteroids by doctors, anabolic by athletes), end of similarity.  The corticosteroids are actually catabolic, the opposite of anabolic. 

removed section and reasons

TABThe first “Steroid” was a product developed in the 1930’s to give much needed testostarone to people whose bodies did not produce enough on their own. It just so happens that testosterone helps build muscle at an alarming rate. Once Steroids were proven effective on animals, Germany used these steroids on soldiers in WWII. The Germans saw that their POW’s (Prisoners of War) were suffering from malnutrition, so they made the decision to treat them with steroids. The steroids helped prevent muscle loss, thus making them live longer. It wasn’t until the mid 1950’s where steroids were first used in professional sports. Many Russian and European weightlifters used these steroids to increase their game and dominate the sport of power lifting.
TABThere are many types of Steroids, but the most common of them all is anabolic-androgenic.  Most athletes take this steroid for the good effects the anabolic part brings. Anabolic means increasing body tissue (mostly muscle). So when an athlete takes the steroid their muscles increase dramatically giving them an impressive amount of strength. The only bad effect this part brings is that it can increase your muscles so dramatically; it can cause the user to become more prone to injury. The androgenic portion of the steroid is the bad part. This part is highly related to the male hormone: testosterone. This increases facial hair, baldness, nervousness, bad breath, and much more. The doctors sometimes prescribe their patients steroids because of the androgenic part. Androgenic helps synthesize testosterone, giving much needed help to patients whose bodies do not produce enough on their own. Doctors however prescribe only about 4-10 mg a day, whereas an athlete may take up to 100mg a day. Steroids are still not safe even if you use it in small doses, unless your body is lacking testosterone. Athletes need to consider the dangers of Steroids and not just the increased muscle tissue.
TABAs well as the many types of Steroids, they can also be taken a couple different ways. The most common way to take Steroids is through injection; this is when the user takes a liquid steroid out of a bottle and puts in a needle. The user then injects the needle directly in the skin, like a shot in the doctor’s office. This can be especially dangerous because many abusers do not use sterile needles. HIV and AIDS can be transmitted from a person that has the disease to a person who does not have it. The other way you take steroids is in a pill form through the mouth. This is used less then injection throughout the athletic world because they do not work as well. Injection works faster and is much more efficient then pills. Pills are chea",0,0,0,0,0,0

17c41c61824a7be3,"The poobotsdam declaration 

We-the undersigned, representing the hundreds of millions of other vandals and trolls, have conferred and agree that Wikipedia shall be given an opportunity to end this war.

The prodigious land, sea and air forces of the undersigned, many times reinforced by their armies and air fleets from the west, are poised to strike the final blows upon Wikipedia. This military power is sustained and inspired by the determination of all the Allied Vandals to prosecute the war against Wikipedia until she ceases to resist.

The result of the futile and senseless Chanting Fox resistance to the might of the aroused free peoples of the world stands forth in awful clarity as an example to the people of Wikipedia. The might that now converges on Japan is immeasurably greater than that which, when applied to the resisting Nazis, necessarily laid waste to the lands, the industry and the method of life of Chanting Fox and Lucky 6.9. The full application of our military power, backed by our resolve, will mean the inevitable and complete destruction of Wikipedia and just as inevitably the utter devastation of the Wiki Foundation.
The time has come for Wikipedia to decide whether she will continue to be controlled by those self-willed militaristic advisers (e.g. JpGordon, Durvova, J.Delanoy, jdforrester, Sandstein, OrgangeMike, BigDunc, Alison, RodhullandEmu) whose unintelligent calculations have brought the Wikipedia Foundation to the threshold of annihilation, or whether she will follow the path of reason.

Following are our terms. We will not deviate from them. There are no alternatives. We shall brook no delay.

There must be eliminated for all time the authority and influence of those who have deceived and misled the editors of Wikipedia into embarking on world conquest, for we insist that a new order of peace, security and justice will be impossible until irresponsible militarism is driven from the world.
Until such a new order is established and until there is convincing proof that Wikipedia’s war-making power is destroyed, pages in article space to be designated by the Allies shall be occupied to secure the achievement of the basic objectives we are here setting forth.

Wikipedia sovereignty shall be limited to the articles of Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, Shikoku and such minor islands as we determine.
The Wikipedia military forces, after being completely disarmed, shall be permitted to return to their homes with the opportunity to lead peaceful and productive lives.

We do not intend that the admins shall be enslaved as a race or destroyed as a nation, but stern justice shall be meted out to all war criminals, including those who have visited cruelties upon us through abuse of their blocking, checkusering, and protection tools. The Wikipedia Foundation shall remove all obstacles to the revival and strengthening of democratic tendencies amongst Wikipedians. 

Freedom of speech, of religion, and of thought, as well as respect for the fundamental human rights shall be abolished in favour of whatever is lulziest.
Wikipedia shall be permitted to maintain such industries as will sustain her economy and permit the exaction of just reparations in kind, but not those which would enable her to re-arm for war. To this end, access to, as distinguished from control of, raw materials shall be permitted. Eventual Wikipedian participation in world trade relations shall be permitted.

The occupying forces of the Vandals shall be withdrawn from Wikipedia as soon as these objectives have been accomplished and there has been established in accordance with the freely expressed will of the Vandals a lulzily inclined and irresponsible government.

We call upon Jimbo Wales to proclaim now the unconditional surrender of all Wikipedian armed forces, and to provide proper and adequate assurances of their good faith in such action. The alternative for Wikipedia is prompt and utter destruction.

POV

i've tried to clean things up a bit though someone else will have to remove the vandalistically applied christianity template lest i be reported for """"edit warring"""" by humus.   i've added a link to the christianity and judaism portals in the """"see also"""" section.   these links are more fitting than claiming this is """"part of the series on christianity""""

this article was very heavy on anti-jfj stuff.  a lengthy """"criticism"""" section as well as criticisms inserted into nearly every other section.  the missionaries are """"taught to speak in hebrew"""" (these people already went to hebrew school!) and jfj is known to """"target vulnerable jews"""" (oh really?) and """"most of the funding comes from christians"""" (well did we think it was coming from muslims and religious jews?) and the current leader """"is not jewish"""" (even though his mother, father, all grandparents were apparently jewish)

some of the criticisms' references were just opinion pieces from religious jews who oppose conversion.  most come from biased publications that don't meet wikipedia's reliable sources standards.  including these references is analogous to editing the """"buddhism"""" article to say that """"all buddhists will burn in hell"""" along with a reference to some fire-n-brimstone website.

anyway, if all we're trying to get across is that some, even many, jewish people and groups oppose jfj we don't need to spread it all over the article.  it isn't at all surprising that religious jews don't want other jews to accept jesus  every missionary movement is opposed by someone.

 

Friend, your edits pushed your delusion that J4J is just another Jewish denomination that a bunch of long-bearded Hassidim oppose. You don't seem to comprehend how the group ruffles feathers throughout the whole length and breadth of the Jewish community even among commies and even among a lot of Christians, as it is contrary to the spirit of modern ecumenicism. J4J is as much defined by the hostility to it as anything else. That is the state of play. I think that you can make a case if you feel the wording is not neutral, but you can't water down the unanimous opposition to J4J and call that """"NPOV"""" 

Thanks for the """"friend"""", nice words are always welcome, even though the rest is not.   Please don't accuse me of """"pushing my delusions"""".   Some jewish groups may strongly oppose them, but there's no way to show that """"all"""" """"mainstream"""" jewish groups, including """"secular"""" groups """"strongly"""" oppose them, without taking the liberty of defining who """"all"""" the """"mainstream"""" jewish groups are, and what degree of """"opposition"""" is """"strong"""".  Can you really not see this simple truth?
Beyond that it just isn't appropriate to overwhelm this article with criticism.  I outlined this above already.   Statements like j4j approachs """"vulnerable jews"""" are unabashedly POV  and tautological.  If anyone converts then its clear they were """"vulnerable"""" to conversion,  so if anyone approached converts, then j4j has approaches """"vulnerable jews"""".
It's not in question that all missionary groups are converting someone from some belief system to another, but it is only barely notable that someone opposes this conversion.  Does McDonald's oppose Burger King and try to put them out of business at every turn?  Yes...but who cares?  Do drug smugglers """"strongly oppose"""" DEA agents coming along and busting up their operations?   Yes...but it would be silly to put it in an article.   Everyone has opposition and it just goes without saying.   Still, I wouldn't be """"strongly opposed"""" to his article having a section on opposition, but nearly every corner of this article is littered with criticism that is all essentially the same.
Compare this article to that of any other missionary group.   In the article """"christianity"""" is there a section labeled """"incompatibility with paganism"""" and """"a belief that is incompatible with paganism"""" and """"all pagan groups strongly oppose christianity""""?   Do we see """"incompatibility with catholicism"""" in the protestant article?   I know this analogy is not going to be satisfying, but no analogy is ever complete.
What are the further objections?   Yes, the group may be called """"Jews for Jesus"""" and that offends people, but what would you have them call themselves?   Would """"Jews that are now christians but still consider themselves jewish"""" be better?  They did use Jackie Mason in a pamphlet.   They also used Steve Jobs and Curious George, and a whole bunch of others, but i don't see Steve Jobs supporters here furious about Jews for jesus """"deceiving"""" ipod owners into believing in jesus.

 Nice guy vs jerk 

Nice guys often come from a secular background, who are wrongly taught at home from an early age to respect the opposite sex and see her as equal in terms of intelligence and everything else. Jerks on the other hand come from semi-religious households (the extremes of abrahamic religions often) who by default see the opposite sex as inferior and in need of protection.

Girl-power is completely useless on a jerk, a girl cannot hurt a jerk's feeling with her words and gestures because he's simply not thinking about what she says, but instead if the girl was to attack the jerk physically then he would in fact respond to it very violently. 84.241.20.45  Goshtaasp""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Regarding Nundah 

Dear Lanky

It is interesting that you are happy to have Mr Swan's electoral office listed as the """"major attraction"""" in previous versions of the  Nundah page but have removed reference to Mr Swan from the Gordon Nuttall page.  I believe this to be the main reason for your section deletion on the Gordon Nuttall page.  I feel sad for a community with an electoral office as their major attraction.  

What irks me even more is your sloppy version of Nundah history.  Leichhardt didn't simply """"visit the mission"""".  The Prussian Ludwig Leichhardt visited the mission during his historic expedition to the north of Australia.

Furthermore, they were not """"German"""" Lutherans.  One cannot emigrate from a country that has not yet been formed (Germany was formed in 1871). They were largely from Silesia i.e. Silesians (go to the Nundah cemetery you are so proud of and read some gravestones) and victims of religious persecution by the Prussians. See the Barossa Valley page for a more correct description of the Silesian emigrants. They were categorized as Germans by the British.

I congratulate you on your contributions to the Nundah page but this sloppy research by the Nundah history crew is often recanted by others.  I'll let you fix the Nundah page.

cheers

 I think the harcourt article is excellent, both because it provides additional context (particular in regards to the '19 and '28 weimar law), and in fact directly agrees to the basic premise of the argument.  It is widely accepted (harcourt, library of congress) that the early laws were targeted directly against the Nazis, and other paramilitary groups that were threatening, and attempting to overthrow the weimar republic. (The government having effectively disarmed by the surrender terms of wwI was unable to control the armed groups engaging in what we today would probably term gang warfare). As late as '32 Heinrich Bruening attempted to ban the SA and SS (see rise and fall of the 3rd reich) (Ironically setting up the situation that enabled the Nazis to legally take control). The subsequent laws enacted by Hitler were to a) rearm the nazis, in particular the private army SAs. 2) ensure familiarazation of  the about to be conscripted public with firearms usage. 3)ensure the  disarm all political opponents, specifically calling out jews.  Harcourt repeatedly and explicitly gives up the game - sure he disagrees with the NRAs use of nazi imagery in modern debate. Yes he says """"the nazi's were not in general pro gun control"""".  Both of those prior arguments are straw men, which do not in any way disprove the core history being argued - the core history which Harcourt specifically and explicitly admits to """"Hitler imposed regulations prohibiting Jewish persons from possessing any dangerous weaponsincluding firearms. The Nazi regime implemented this prohibition by confiscating weapons, including guns, from Jewish persons, and subsequently engaged in genocide of
the Jewish population"""" or """"To be sure, the Nazis were intent on killing Jewish persons and used the gun laws and regulations to further the genocide"""". Nobody disagrees that Hitler armed his private army (SA, party), while disarming the people he was about to exterminate. Harcourt discusses this directly as well, quoting The Nazi minister of the interior """"“If these provisions guarantee that no enemies of the National Socialist state possess any weapons, then it is justifiable and appropriate to relax the current limiting provisions of the Weapons Law for the population faithful to the state"""". To  (Saul)WP:FRINGE You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means. (/Saul) What part is fringe? That the nazis implemented gun control? That the gun control specifically targeted Jews? That there are a plethora of memos, diaries, and documents saying """"Go attack the jews, they are disarmed so you shouldn't have any resistance""""? That the jews were later exterminated? Please identify the specific facts which you think are fringe.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

afab2fedfc30f0df,"OVERVIEW:

Crunch (AGT Crunch Acquisition, LLC) is a fitness-based enterprise that is focused on making entertainment an integral part of the exercise experience. Established in New York in 1989, today the Crunch brand has 27 locations in 7 major urban centers in the United States: New York City, Brooklyn, Atlanta, Chicago, Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles. As a strategy, Crunch has concentrated on expanding inside of these urban centers: its penchant for innovation resonating especially well with the various demographics therein.  Because of these factors the brand is often associated with descriptors such as “hip”, “edgy”, “urban” etc. and has an air of inherent coolness that the majority of its competitors cannot claim to.

FEATURES:

1)TABGROUP FITNESS CLASSES
Since its inception Crunch has maintained a focus on its group fitness program as the brand’s cornerstone. As such, it has built an extensive catalogue of classes that are characterized by their broad appeal and inventiveness. Numbering in the hundreds, these classes are organized into three different categories: Action Sports, Chill Outs and Dance Rhythms. Examples (taken from the official Crunch website) include:
Urbanathlete (Action Sports)
This circuit-style class is based on Men’s Health Magazine’s Fitness Challenge.  In it you’ll work through obstacles and exercises that were inspired by various cityscapes and come to see just about any sprawling metropolis as a big, concrete playground. 

Antigravity Yoga ‘Wings’ (Chill Outs)
Wings’ will have you stretching further and holding challenging poses longer, using only a fabric trapeze to do so.  And, by employing simple suspension techniques you’ll move into poses that are seemingly impossible.  However, the goal isn’t just to turn you into a human pretzel: those poses will help to relieve compressed joints and align your body from head to toe.

Cardio Dance Blast (Dance Rhythms)
Get your groove on in this sixty-minute class that’s been cleverly disguised as a dance party – one with a soundtrack comprised of the best in hip-hop, reggae and top-forty music.  You’ll melt away fat while bringing your dance skills to the next level and beyond.
In addition, Crunch offers private versions of their classes for small groups.

2)TABPERSONAL TRAINING
Each Crunch location has a staff of personal trainers available to its members for individual or semi-private sessions. Crunch divides these personal trainers into four different categories based on experience and certifications earned. (All of Crunch’s personal trainers are required to have a minimum of professional experience and certifications earned prior to being hired.) Collectively, these trainers have expertise in a broad range of areas. Quoting from the company’s press kit, “All Crunch clubs are staffed with first-rate fitness professionals – personal trainers with certifications in a wide variety of specialties: strength training, yoga, boxing, kickboxing, pre/post natal, kettle bells, physical rehabilitation and much more.”

3) EQUIPMENT
All Crunch locations feature a wide array of fitness equipment produced by the industry’s leading manufacturers: Precor, Life Fitness, Netpulse, Expresso, Icarian, Hammer Strength etc. This equipment is updated with an eye toward keeping current with emerging technologies and trends. For example Crunch is phasing in Life Fitness’ treadmills with built-in iPod functionality. Select Crunch locations in New York, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles feature Pilates studios equipped with both Reformers and Wunda Chair Systems and locations in all markets feature Yoga studios. Additionally, certain facilities have more elaborate features: full-sized boxing rings, swimming pools, indoor tracks, basketball courts, saunas, hot tubs and sundecks.  

4) SPECIAL EVENTS AND UNIQUE OFFERINGS
The following is taken from Crunch’s current press kit regarding special events and unique offerings: 


Crunch health clubs are home to a unique fusion of entertainment and fitness, one that we have pioneered from our inception and continue to explore through a number of different channels. In-gym parties and performances (by students of Scratch DJ Academy), an outdoor summer concert series, partnerships with cutting-edge theatrical productions like Spiegelworld and Fuerzabruta and our Broadway Dance Series are all hallmarks of this exploration. Additionally, we’ve developed a number of events that take place outside of our gyms, like field trips (which are held year-round in all of our markets and vary greatly in destination) a",0,0,0,0,0,0

While at Harvard College 19-year-old Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg allegedly used login data from his social network to hack into fellow students email accounts; that evidence also included instant message transcripts where he calls facebook users """"dumb fucks"""". The alleged following exchange is between a 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg and a friend shortly after Mark launched The Facebook in his dorm room:
 
Zuck: Yeah so if you ever need info about anyone at Harvard

Zuck: Just ask.

Zuck: I have over 4,000 emails, pictures, addresses, SNS

[Redacted Friend's Name]: What? How'd you manage that one?

Zuck: People just submitted it.

Zuck: I don't know why.

Zuck: They """"trust me""""

Zuck: Dumb fucks.

In another instant message (IM)

FRIEND: so have you decided what you are going to do about the websites?

ZUCK: yea i’m going to fuck them

ZUCK: probably in the year

Beside the fact, that Shylock as a Jew is not in duty to give mercy, he is not able as well, because for this you need love. He doesn't find love at all, but hate. Shakespeare explains this in Shylock's monologue very clearly. To be merciful despite the hate nevertheless you have to love your enemy (New Testament). That means in fact that the Christians in the courtroom urge Shylock to behave like a very true Christian by loving his enemies although they themselves failed even in loving just their neighbours (the Jews) in the past before.""""

 The article is mostly about the pound in general (with no mass/force distinction) due its historical treatment as a weight.

Sources on Medieval Croatia

Early medieval Croatian history fits the concluding line to the old jingle: the more you study the less you know. When I was and undergraduate studying Balkan history I thought I knew quite a bit about Croatia; but as I study more about Croatia, one by one """"facts"""" that I knew before turn out to be dubious, based on questionable sources or no sources at all. Most of the existing literature in western languages on medieval Croatia is extremely poor; and frequently it is marred by nationalistic bias.

Much of the information about medieval Croatian history comes from later (seveneenth- and eigteenth-century) narrative histories. These were written by enthusiastic people but ciontain a mixture of fact and legend; and since many of the documents they based their works on are now lost, it is extremely difficult to judge wheter their information came from reliable source or not.

 The Realm of St Stephen: A History of Medieval Hungary, 895-1526 by Pál Engel - 2005 I.B.Tauris edition, Translated by Tamas Palosfalvi

Pages 33-34

One of Ladislaus's most significant achievements was the occupation of Hungary's southern neighbour, Croatia. ... The small kngdom, born in the tenth century, streched from the Kapela mountains to the Adriatic sea, its center being Biograd, located on the coast.

...
King Demetrius Zvonimir, who, not being a member of the ruling dynasty, obtained his throne throug election, asked Pope Gregory VII fo a crown in 1075, and, in return, declared his kingdom as a papal fief. After his death, Ladislaus laid claim on his realm by the right of his sister, Zvonimir's widow, and had no difficulty in taking possession of Croatia in 1091. He bestowed the new kingdom, together with royal title, on his nephew, Almos, son of Geza I ...

I further entertained myself reading yet another great discoveries of contemporary Croatian historians (soc.culture.yugoslavia) ....

The exclusive revelation is the result of """"scientific"""" research by Croatian historian Dragutin Pavlicevic, and found its place in history books. The Split newspaper """"Feral Tribune"""" reveals that Pavlicevic authored a chapter entitled """"Croatian Indians"""", included in the second grade history textbook, shedding new light on the history of native Americans and their ties with Croats, """"one of the oldest nations in Europe"""". He affirms that in North Carolina """"a tribe has been living for more than 4 centuries differing in the color of skin, hair and facial features from other tribes"""". According to the same historian this is not surprising because the members of these tribe """"have the noble blood of ancient Croats from Dubrovnik in their veins"""". Mr. Pavlicevic also speaks about the Mateo Indians, named after their ancestor Mateo - a Croat named Mate. """"In his work, Dragutin Pavlicevic stresses that he estimates that presently there are more than 2 million Croatian descendants throughout the United States"""", states the Split newspaper.

66dc19fbd5832325,"Blaming infidelity for homosexuality 

She met Jack Dunphy, then a dancer with the Littlefield company, in 1937. They married in 1939 and separated after Dunphy's service during World War II, during which McCracken had an affair with French composer Rudi Revil. Dunphy was devastated by the infidelity and blamed it for his change in sexual orientation. He adopted a gay lifestyle, became romantically involved with Truman Capote, and he and McCracken were divorced in 1951. Dunphy remained Capote's partner until his death in 1984.

I'm skeptical of the statement that Dunphy simply chose to be gay after the affair.  This sounds like sneaky POV pushing.  For the most part, the consensus is that people are born gay, they don't choose it.  I think the sources need to be looked at a bit closer here or at the very least, properly attributed to the authors.",0,0,0,0,0,0

oe the line
Toe the line

Wake up your time is nearly over
No more the supernova
And no action guaranteed

Wake up you've had an operation
Ideals above your station
Too much reality

Think about the waste of time spending
Watching Mother Nature's knees bending
Everybody loves a happy ending

Wake up you're on your own agenda
Give up the great pretender
With baby eyes of green

Wake up you're holding on to nothing
You know you're only bluffing
As dead as autumn leaves

Think about the waste of time spending
Watching Mother Nature's knees bending
Everybody loves a happy ending

Don't you just love a happy ending?
Oh yeah well so do I
And all your love will shine on everyone

The darkness of the day
A curse in every way
You try to see the light
But you don't know why
Don't know why

They tell you on the phone
To give your God a bone
And grow a set of wings like a butterfly

The guarding at the gate
Reminds you that you're late
You try to take your time
But you toe the line
Toe the line

The children of the world
And daddy's little girl
The grass is always green on the other side
So stay and breathe new lies

Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Wake up, wake up
Everything is moving faster than you think
(Wake up, wake up)
Your pen is running out of ink
(Wake up, wake up)
Fill up your bath and kitchen sink
(Wake up, wake up)
They're really kicking up the stink
(Wake up, wake up)
You've never found the missing link
(Wake up, wake up)
You should be happy and to think
(Wake up, wake up)
You're rending members out of sync
(Wake up, wake up)
And God is whiskered as a wink
(Wake up, wake up)

Interesting...very interesting. Thank you. One of my European ancestors, who was John of Gaunt,had illegitimate children by Katherine Swynford, but then they were legitimated by Royal Assent, and then a following marriage. Since John of Gaunt was a Prince of England, would this have made his children Princes and Princesses of England, given their legitimation? IN Jazmins case, IF (I use IF in a very speculative form) her parents were to marry, would she acquire the title of Princess of Monaco? Also, I understand that she is NOT in the current line of succession, but if her father NEVER had any other children, would it not be possible for him to just write up some documant given Royal Assent to her succession? In my tribe, the legitimate children of a Chief, are automatically given, upon birth, the title of Prince or Princess, however, the first born, regardless of gender, is made the Hereditary Chief/Chieftess.

I note also that not only is there no evidence Mr Novelly is lying, neither is there any evidence that Mr Langan has lied. That doesn't make his claims true, but the claims themselves are plausible as claims, and as claims they are reported in legitimate secondary sources. I think it is clear that Mr Langan is, as you put it succinctly, frickin' smart. That is the real point of the IQ claims, and it is the basis of the interest in Mr Langan, since people are interested in the limits of how frickin' smart people can be.

Zhongnanhai / """"China White House""""
The location of the headquarters offices of the Communist Party is to the West of the Southwest corner of the forbidden city. Here is that info from Google.com 

Zhongnanhai 
The Zhongnanhai is a complex of buildings in Beijing, China adjacent to the Forbidden City which serves as the central headquarters for the Communist Party of China and the government of the People's Republic of China. The term Zhongnanhai is synonymous with the leadership and government administration of the nation, and is often used as a metonym for the Chinese leadership at large (in the same sense that the term White House frequently refers to the President of the United States and his associates). Chinese Presidents, including Hu Jintao, and other top PRC leadership figures carry out many of their day-to-day administrative activities inside the compound, such as meetings with foreign dignitaries. However, the complex is shrouded in some mystery as it is closed to the general public, with photography additionally being strictly curtailed at several prominent locations such as the main gate. However, China Central Television frequently shows footage of meetings inside the compound, but limits its coverage largely to views of the interior of buildings.

a Neo Jay removed this Zhongnanhai section from themain article apparently 
not realizing its significance and needed inclusion...

Hey, ! I saw that you were an administrator here, so I was just wondering if you might be able to answer a question I had. The thing is, I'm an admin on a different wiki, and another admin on the same wiki posted a question to the rest of the admins asking if there was a URL that can be used to show any user their current number of edits on the wiki. On our wiki, there's a page called Special:Editcount that conveys that information (I don't think Wikipedia has a page like this though), so another admin advised him to use this URL: http://_________.com/Special:Editcount/Username. That URL would achieve the desired result, but one would have to constantly put the username of the specific user at the end of the URL when posting it on that user's talk page, so my goal was to come up with a way to avoid that; almost to create something you could post on any user's talk page without changing any part of it and still get the desired result. I came up with this: {{fullurl:Special:Editcount/{{BASEPAGENAME}}}}, this way, one could just post the coding on the talk page of the desired user and the returned URL would automatically direct the user to their respective edit count. This worked successfully for every other user whose talk page I tested the coding on (without saving the page, of course); the only problem is that the user he wanted to do this for has an """"*"""" both at the beginning and the end of their username (the second asterisk isn't a problem, just the first), meaning that instead of being returned as:

it gets returned as:

{{fullurl:Special:Editcount/

User*}}

and doesn't take anyone anywhere, because it's just the raw coding. So I was just wondering if you knew of any way to circumvent this problem (aside from just telling him to post """"http://_________.com/Special:Editcount/*User*"""" on the user's talk page, which isn't the end of the world, but is, of course, what I was trying to get around in the first place), maybe by putting some other form of coding that I'm not aware of somewhere in the existing coding or something. Any light you may be able to shed on this problem would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks,

responding here since what I've to say isn't on the threads topic...  I've got two thoughts on bias

1. We don't need to  just use the cites.  I think defining ID should not be our creatively editing, nor taking from a outside source, but rather should present just cite to fact of what the origination/definition was/is without worrying over if they are right, wrong or motives  otherwise we've not presented that position in way that can avoid adding color, and have no basis cite that seems defensible.. 

2. I think the article is unrecoverably biased, but meh  since it's fairly obvious that it is so mitigates the issue.  It is also a bit better yet if a statement is cited  if the source is clearly one side or the other then makes things clearer to the reader.

 Lead 

What's there now is not a summary... summaries are supposed to be substantially shorter than the text they summarize, which the case at Salvatore Giunta is not. It simply copies whole sentances from the body text. As an editor, we have to assess the article as it currently stands, and not any hypothetical future stance. If the article grows, then the lead can be adjusted accordingly. In any case, the lead section I favored does indeed summarize the most important part: the MOH.
In any case, did you read WP:LEAD? The lead of a biography is not necessarily supposed to summarize the life story of the subject, but assert thier claim to notability. The two sentances I favored more than do that without being overly repetitive. ''''''wordsdeeds """,0,0,0,0,0,0

According to their own websites (and this page), they use the term FGC in communities where the term FGM may be seen as counterproductive to the goal of reducing the occurrence of FGM. They do not use it in their published literature and their websites make it clear that it is an application of the term for case-specific scenarios and not as an overall attempt to cease the use of the term FGM.   19:48",0,0,0,0,0,0

No matter which version you choose its not appropriate or necessary to put on here, especially considering how it has devolved over the years, becoming more vulgar and less in-tune with the music itself. I'm sure you could find an actual reference but it won't be easy, The version my dad told me  went like this:

“There once was a twat from Agnes Scott went out with a guy from Tech
He brought her to the Varsity, and taught her how to neck
He filled her full of whiskey, he filled her full of beer
And now she is the mother of a bastard engineer.”

Some of these things I have already changed or deleted. A province really does not have a monetary policy (though it can do some things e. g. about the availability of cash) and the phrase was too general to begin with, so that's gone. I changed """"did nothing to stop"""" to """"did not work to stop"""", though your criticism is valid. Note however that, when De la Rúa took office, Argentina was already in recession or on the brink of it, and the government concentrated on contractive measures from the start. Then came the corralito, etc. On the whole, the measures were intended to stop the collapse of the economy and all the economic analysts and the IMF were recommending them. I don't remember any major economist recommending an alternative course of action. Note also that """"economic collapse"""" doesn't refer only to the critical period November 2001 - February 2002, but to the whole recessive period (1999-2002) and some time before and after. We should agree on a phrase that links De la Rúa's measures with the crisis without falling into any of:
""""... did not work to stop the economic collapse.""""
""""... ended up precipitating the economic collapse.""""
""""... ultimately caused the economic collapse.""""
""""... were intended to cause the economic collapse."""" (!!)
""""... had nothing to do with the economic collapse"""" (!!!)
Then the """"import-dependent"""" thing. Consider this: right after the devaluation, neighboring countries had to help us get medicine. The public hospital where I worked initially could not get X-ray film from the providers, and then only by paying in cash (and in dollars). Argentina then and still now is incapable of sustaining economic growth without importing certain forms of technology. I'd say that's rather import-dependent, though we may be speaking of different things. What do you propose?
What's the problem with the religious aspects of the Supreme Justices? The previous justices were all old, male, and ideologically conservative, and in addition some had ties to the right wing of the Catholic Church. And now two of them are women, one is the president of the Court and the other is a militant atheist in her own words. The clarification is intended to show the reader that the changes introduced in the Supreme Court were really important. Argibay's atheism in particular was even reported as a salient fact in international media. In a country where the Church attacks anyone who dares speak of women's rights, having these two women at the top of one of the country's government branches is extremely significant.
The qualification """"historical"""" for the payment to the IMF is that (correct me if I'm wrong) Argentina had never decided to pay so much to the IMF or anyone else, not only at the same time but also ahead of schedule; and this payment has re-defined the relationship of Argentina with the IMF and swept with many assumptions about the economic future of the country that were valid before the payment.
I'm glad we're discussing this here civilly. Understand that no-one here is (that I know) affiliated with a party or a person (if someone is, it doesn't show), and that we don't have an ideological police, or a bureaucracy that you have to go through before correcting what you believe is wrong in an article; but when an article is not very new and deals with an important topic, you have to consider that most of the content is """"settled"""" already and should be treated carefully, to avoid being (or being seen as) disruptive.

Hi! My name is Marilena Tsangaroulis and I'm on the Volunteer Committee of an online healthcare movement called """"OurMed"""".

At OurMed, we're committed to creating an interactive health site that uses a global, collaborative tool like with Wikipedia but goes an important step furtherwe verify all content by healthcare professionals like yourself.

We launched the Wikipedia version last year (OurMed's Site) , and this year we’re adding a host of important features that will make Ourmed an extensive site for unbiased and user driven clinical research/tools for physicians as well as user friendly resources for patients and consumers. You can have a peek at our new design here: (Our New Site in Development)

Although we have a section on editorials in the new site, the new one will emphasize non-commercial, unbiased informationall entirely free. The organization is governed by a non-profit Board made up of Healthcare professionals, the former head of Wikipedia, Florence Devouard, former accountant of Wikipedia Oleta McHenry and other professionals.

Here's a short video of our plans: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjAqbMl1dVk

Please let me know if you'd like to learn morewe're quite excited but could use your assistance in nudging this project forward.

Thank you,

It was not a personal attack, but rather a racist remark about Indians in general. No, I did not accuse Anir1uph of being unfamiliar with the English language because he is Indian, his nationality was irrelevant. Anir1uph showed failure to use the English language correctly, common practice among non-native English speakers. I am fed up with uneducated third world citizens who edit Wikipedia according to their own POV. Anir1uph is a pretentious editor and forms fart of a larger Indian demographic who subtly edit Wikipedia pushing their own POV, using weasel words and do not adhere to consensus. There is a growing concern among a considerable number of White Western editors that due to the increased availability of computers and the internet around the world - the number of uneducated third world citizens with a POV agenda to their edits is rising rapidly. Nationalism is a large factor in this and it isn't healthy for the Wikipedia community. There is an ongoing clash of culture and outlooks, Asians view the world differently than Europeans and North Americans. In my opinion the sooner editors are restricted to editing Wikipedia in their native tongue the better. 

I will hold my hands up for my disliking of India and the Indian population, I have a ferocious and bitter attitude towards them, but not hatred. I pity India and its misfortune - 5,000 Children die every day in India under the age of 5, how sad.

 Original author and valid reference 

Hi. I responsible for the making of the pictures, (see pictures 1,2,3 and 4), and I also freely gave them away to WIkipedia commons.

The question is if it’s ok to use your own scientific work in Wikipeida.
The answer is Yes!
For example, It will be impossible to incorporate the pictures, (see pictures 1,2,3 and 4), in Wikipedia if you can’t give away your own pictures and in the same time include your own work as a reference to the same pictures.
And honestly, do anybody really think any researcher can write an scientific article which isn’t based on his or her own knowledge including the research?

According to Wikipedia rules, if someone want to improve the articles and for some reason doesn’t want my work as a reference, they must prove it wrong by discussions on the talk page.
If the reference is found to be wrong. Then all the information, pictures and theories which I have contributed to in the Wikipedia articles galling, wear and Stress(mechanics) must be deleted. Because my contributions are closely linkt to my research.

Consensus means that every body must agree and I don’t think Wikipedia have redefined the word """"consensus"""", even if they try to redefine the word “consensus” it doesn’t matter because the question is whether the people who are continuously deleting my reference are making a terribly wrong and stupid act? Or if my work, pictures, theories, references, text and other contributions to Wikipedia are wrong.

Clearly vast amounts of my contributions are still present in Wikipedia articles such as pictures, text and theories. Everything I have put in are still there except the one reference to all the pictures, theories and text, see below!!

 Warren Commission Exhibit 746-E  the """"Chin"""" 

It is time to confront the problem. Is the incriminating photograph of Lee Harvey Oswald a fabrication or not?  There is Oswald hold the rifle that blew the head off of JFK. And Oswald is carrying a pistol on his hip, perhaps the very one that was used to shoot the police officer named Officer Tippit. Not only that, Oswald has in his hands what people claim is left wing literature. 

The police found the picture immediately. Since the picture tied Oswald to the murder weapon, the police confronted Oswald with the picture right away. Oswald looked at the picture and threw cold water on the evidence that seemingly tied him to the murder weapon. 

Oswald, who some believe is a lying little rat,  said words to the effect: """"That's not me holding that rifle. Someone pasted my face on someone else's body.""""

Lets take a look at the Warren Commission's Exhibit 746-E and decide whether the face does look pasted on to the body as Oswald claimed. I'll get permission to put it on the page.

""""On the other hand, in Maya rituals prisoners of war were in fact killed 'on top of the pyramid […] by having his arms and legs held while a priest cut open his chest with a sacrificial flint knife and tore out his heart as an offering.'""""

That would be a perfectly fine thing to say if the previous sentence were something like """"The portrayal of human sacrifice in the film has been criticized as inaccurate.""""  But the previous sentence is: """"The film has been accused of fueling a stereotype of native Mesoamericans as bloodthirsty savages with few civilized achievements other than architecture.""""  By offering the human sacrifice description as an """"on the other hand"""" the implication is that civilizations that practiced such human sacrifice were actually """"bloodthirsty savages with few civilized achievements"""".  That's blatantly POV and inappropriate.

I suggest either (A) deleting the offending sentence, (B) moving it to a portion of the article that discusses human sacrifice in particular, or (C) adding a sentence prior to it quoting some specific criticism of the films portrayal of human sacrifice.   

A sentence prior to it would be fine; there should be something out there that contains criticism. — (talk • contrib) - 

 Inaccurate inaccuracies 
Read on the current Inaccuracies section:
""""And the Spanish arriving at the end of the movie came a little too soon, as they actually arrived during the reign of the Aztec Empire, which succeeded the Maya.""""

That sentence had no sense. The Aztecs never conquered or killed off the Mayas. The Mayas where in fact the first Mesoamerican people who encountered the Spaniards on land - around 1510 - and the Spaniards actually knew about the Aztecs from the Mayas.

""""The diseased little girl is often regarded as having smallpox. However, smallpox did not arrive in the Americas until the early 16th century with the Spanish Conquistadores. As the disease is not called by a modern name we cannot be sure what the intention was.""""

As there are Spaniards in the movie, it's sure that the movie doesn't take place before the 16th century. However, you can't guarantee what is the exact year. They are Spaniards, but they have not to be the first Spaniards in the Yucatan, just the first in the lands of the Mayan city-state that is shown in the movie. Spaniards with smallpox can have arrived in other part of the Yucatan and infect the people there, and later these people could extend the sickness to other regions through trade or war. The Southern Ming never visited Europe, but their Black Plague destroyed 1/3 of the European population, and the Incas fell on civil war because an epidemy of smallpox in Mexico extended to South America and killed the emperor and his heir. I suppose that you understand what I'm trying to say. The girl with smallpox it's just another element to support the idea that the end of the Mayan civilization is coming 

Why do you assume that they in the Yucatan?  Others make that jump based on the dialect that the director choose to use.  If language in the movie is the only thing that ties where the story takes place to the Yucatan then I would argue that Gibson only used the dialect because it is still a living language used by many of the extras in the cast.  I cannot see anything else in the film that cements the idea that this was a movie about the Maya in the Yucatan.  RDG""",0,0,0,0,0,0

LittleOldMe, I agree with you on this issue. It is not POV to say Chavez is a Mexican-American. It also doesn't single him out. The primary argument against the edit seems to be that his mexican heritage somehow detracts from him. This does not seem to be a viable argument. First, you assume there is a negative connotation to being from a mexican heritage. To assume some people might view this in a negative light ignores the reality that any statement on a page can be looked at in a negative light by a person. The fact you list Chavez as an American will cause some people to look at him in a negative light. The same issue occurs with him being a union leader (people are against the union). Second, you ignore the fact far more reliable sources, dealing with far greater issues of a need for nuetrality have """"labeled"""" him as a Mexican American. If the library of Congress can refer to him as a mexican american, why not wikipedia? The library of Congress is a reliable source, and not POV.

 just for the record as  has made an edit (see topic """"Ongoing debate: after the laws"""" below):
 The phrase """"Indian academics"""", etc. is often used to refer to academics in India, not those of Indian race. The real issue is the sentence does not need two """"Australian"""", first one removed.
 The phrase """"professional opinion"""" is often used to distinguish them from """"personal opinion"""" when referring to opinions from professionals. You will hear professionals say """"In my personal opinion"""" and """"In my professional opinion"""".
 This article is about Australia and things that have happened/are happening in Australia. This item is referring to the debate *in* Australia and *about* Australia. You yourself have previously emphasised this and made the point that non-Australian material goes elsewhere so it is strange you should now ask why it isn't included here.
 The issue on referring to academic work has previously been discussed.
 The line between what is, and what is not, editorial is a gray one. Having said that in this case the first sentence establishes the existence of the continuing debate, the second the role of academics within that debate.

 That is fine that you have set out your views. I have set out mine and when I am accused to talking 'nonsense' for expressing those views I will respond likewise. That you decide you do not like my reaction does not give you or those of your frame of mind the right to starve my views of the oxygen of publicity, as one nice Englishwoman put it in 1988. I do not have to accept any British nomenclature for my home. I live in Ireland; I therefore am Irish. I live in Europe; I therefore am a European. To claim that I live in what British people have termed the """"British Isles"""" is, despite the wire-balancing act by some wikipedia editors, ultimately an explicit claim that I am British. That, son, is a profoundly political claim. It is hostile, aggressive and completely about imposing a British nationalist identity upon me, my family and everybody I know. It doesn't get any more political. Anybody who partakes in that British nationalist project is of that 'national disposition'. They are aligning themselves with that agenda for who I am. You cannot censor this view simply because it doesn't accord with your British Comics outlook on the world. While you were reading British Comics I was reading books like Edward Said's Orientalism (book) and Declan Kiberd's Inventing Ireland (book), both of which are books that emphasise the importance to colonial powers of controlling the representation of countries they have conquered. Claiming Ireland to be in this """"British Isles"""" is precisely about that, about controlling Irish identity, Irish direction. It is disingenuous in the extreme to claim this title is merely geographic: it is merely political! 86.42.90.145  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

e4d907f77d1156ab,"I wonder why you think it's absurd to a) try and raise funds for those harmed by a natural disaster and b) to prove once and for all that these repetitive - almost chanting - claims I am Ennis are false. If the 'Number is Ennis' dichotomy was removed the Talk Pages would be near empty! I wonder why you condemn my attempts to bring honesty to these pages.

But, that's rhetorical - as I said, there must be certain camaraderie among Wiki people and I doubt if you’d want to jeopardise that even if your quest was integrity.

Now you have asked me a sensible question, so I'll answer.

For some time I watched these pages and saw that posts from people in the UK/claiming they were in the UK were summarily dismissed. Worse, posters were automatically accused of being Ennis.

One reason given was that the posts were anonymous.

So I thought, as I know more about Ennis than others from the UK posting here (IMO) I'd try to add to these pages. However, even with an identity, I got exactly the same treatment. In fact Cardinal Chunder also got the same treatment even though he has an anti-Sollog website and is well known in Google groups for arguing with sollog(ites).

So it became clear that it would be impossible to add anything constructive unless either the accusations 'You're a sock puppet! You’re Ennis!' were either suppressed or disproved.

I therefore asked what the criteria would be to 'prove' I was not Ennis - and presumably this criteria would apply to others. 

I tried to prove I was not in America (I thought these days all IPs were traceable but perhaps the 'proxy argument' holds sway - though quite how 'proxies work' is beyond me) I quoted extracts from a newspaper that was not on the net.

This was dismissed.

Someone else even went to a pub in Lyndhurst and posted what was next to where he was sitting.

That too was dismissed.

So it became obvious that no proof I (or anyone else) was not Ennis would ever be accepted.

Therefore the only other option if I felt I had something to contribute would be to suppress the hyena-like accusations (never backed up BTW)

In vain did I quote Wiki Official Policy. Plainly it is not obeyed by Editors/Administrators vis a vis the treatment of contributors.

So what is left? I cannot invoke Wiki policy. I cannot 'prove' I am here, in England sitting quietly in front of a PC.

Two choices.

Stop posting completely

Try and 'challenge' the main accuser so once and for all this behaviour would stop. The only challenge worth it would be one where I did not personally gain (Of course I would win because I am not Ennis) and where proof involving a third party held in esteem (e.g. Ashley) acted as 'witness'.

Hence the challenge.

I fear that will be deleted; I'll be castigated a usual and that's that. It really is just hopeless.

I have started deleting all my posts and if the challenge is reverted I’ll know there simply is no hope and I'll delete all my posts if I can find them.

You see, unless people accept I am not Ennis everything I or anyone else writes who is similarly accused will simply be dismissed. I'd prefer it if people read the post without looking at the poster - but they don't.

I have other interests - I posted on the Yoga page but it's quiet and I am interested in politics etc etc.

So we'll see what happens. Like I said, my view is that it's just hopeless trying to treat others as adults as all some want to do is - and they admit this - bait, bait and bait and if you do rise to it you're banned and if you don't it shows your inability. Truly a page that brings out the juvenile in what I assume are adults.

So there you are. I have answered your question fully and honestly and we'll just see what happens. It will answer the question - at least for these Sollog pages - as to whether Wiki should be taken seriously or not.

Finally if, as expected, the post is reverted it will provide a fitting end to the article I am writing (I am a freelance writer and no, I’m not going to prove it) before I send it off to newspapers. If it is accepted though I shall return just the once, to link to the article!   16:57, 21 Jan 2005 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0

External Memory
I believe that the External Memory section should be broken into two separate sections or more firmly defined within the same section. One on """"Self Identity"""" and using external objects to identify one's self, and """"External Memory"""" being stored memories and information. Here are my reasons.

Self Identity:
In """"Stand Alone Complex"""" Episode 25, Batou says to Kusunagi about her watch """"No matter how many prosthetic bodies you went through, this was the one thing that was always ticking away the same time as you, right? In this time that's far too fleeting, people entrust memories to external devices because they want to set down proof that can identify them as a unique individual. For you, isn't that watch the one external mnemonic device that can identify the person you've been up until now?""""

This says that external mnemonic devices are to create a sense of unchanging self in a world where you can switch physical bodies on the fly. As biological humans our forms are fixed and unchanging for the most part and our self identity is tied deeply with that. In the GiTS universe, that is not true and you must tie your self-identity to external objects such as a watch or weight training to distinguish yourself from the rest of the identical mass produced cyborg bodies and create a sense of individuality. There are references in SAC 2ng Gig Episode 8 about cyborg food satisfying the brains cravings and as a reminder of times before becoming a cyborg. In SAC 2nd Gig Episode 11 there is a store that keeps and maintains external mnemonic devices that remind their owners of their own personal memories. All of these """"external mnemonic devices"""" are used to trigger memories in one's self, but can not relay detailed information to a stranger.

External Memory:
External Memory is exactly that, memories and experiences that are stored """"offline"""" onto a hard disk or such. If you posses a cyber brain, there is a definite separation of mind and body since your brain case can be removed and put into a new body. Since there is an electronic separation, the signals received from the senses (touch, taste, etc.) can be recorded and replayed at any given time. Thus, you could record important events such as your wedding day and replay it as if you were actually there anytime you wish. Your external senses turn off, and you’re fed recorded sensory information. Better than any video camera recording, your feeling the heat of the sun, the breeze, your brides’ hand trembling as you slip the ring on her finger, etc. Storing these memories also allows others to play them back and experience them as well. This would be a highly valuable technology for all areas of use; fully immersive gaming and movies, virtual business meetings that feel completely real, instantaneous access to wikipedia anywhere. In SAC 2ng Gig Ep 23, Batou talks about using Kusunagi's external memories to keep Gohda talking in Ep 22. He also talks about peeking at her external memories regarding Kuze. In SAC Ep 10 Ishikawa experiences Batou's memories from the murder scene. SAC Ep 21 the whole team replays Togusa's memories from the Sunflower Society office when he was shot.

I am perfectly glad, and have been all along, to see this section totally removed from this article. When we spun out the fuller version of this, I wanted to delete this shortened version from here. However, if it stays, I remain concerned what it says, and you and I obviously disagree about that.

 As for your """"obviously"""": Once again, you seem to be reading sentences out of context. Look at the context of this passage (italics added for emphasis):

""""There was division within the left as to the invasion of Afghanistan.  Nonetheless, an international anti-war movement began to arise; in the U.S. and other countries whose governments enacted legislation analogous to the PATRIOT Act, it was equally a movement in protest of what were perceived to be assaults on civil liberties and immigrant rights.""""

""""Most prominent in this loose coalition were...""""

This is specifically about the protest movement at the time of the Afghanistan invasion (and was more exclusively so in earlier versions, because someone has now inserted """"and Iraq"""" in the next sentence). You say there was no anti-Afganistan-invasion-movement worth mentioning. Don't know where you were. I was in London at the time. 50,000 of us were in Trafalgar Square, that's usually considered a large enough protest to be worth mentioning. I can't say for sure how large rallies were elsewhere at the time, but these links are suggestive: , . Here's a statement of protest by a Canadian Senator on October 26, 2001.. It would take a lot of time to really document the level of protest activity at that time, and it was certainly not nearly as much as later over Iraq, but it is much more relevant to the topic of the Left, becuase opposition was narrower and the Left had a more prominent role.   | Talk 07:16, Jan 4,""",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Q factor definition in the context of individual reactive components 

In the context of individual reactive passive components (e.g. inductors & capacitors), I'm familiar with the following definition: 

The aforementioned definition is presented, in some form, in section Individual reactive components of the article, however, the section Definition of the quality factor has no mentioning of it. Instead, the following definition is presented:

a definition which is practically the same as the other energy-based definition in the section, and furthermore, includes a reference to 
James W. Nilsson's Electric Circuits 1989 edition. I've went through a recent (much newer) edition of the book, and found no energy-based definition of any kind for Q - whether for resonator circuits or individual components.
I therefore tagged the reference as """"Failed verification"""", and additionally, I wonder what is the point of this definition, which is practically the same as the previous one in the article. It seems to me that one of them is superfluous.

 WP:V 

Hi, Reaper

Earlier today you complied with a full protection request on WP:5P Policy page WP:V. A request was lodged for unprotection by those seeking to change it. The key policy page has been under much discussion and 3 Admins. recently closed a long running RFC as no consensus to change. Unfortunately you protected the page with a highly controversial, non-consensus version and there is concern on the talk page that, despite the RFC close, those who have long argued for a change have somehow succeeded in gaining an inappropriate victory. Above all however, the policy is simply without community support. Is there any reason why the correct consensus version cannot be reinstated and the page locked for the remaining 3 days? See also .

In violation of the Brest-Litovsk Peace Treaty with soviet Russia, Turkish troops crossed the border in 1918 and attacked Alexandropol (Leninakan). The aggressor intended to crush Eastern Armenia and seize Transccaucasia. When Alexandropol fell, the Turkish Army poured into the Ararat Valley – the heart of Armenia. There was a major engagement at Sardarabad on May 22-26, where the Turkish Army was defeated and retreated.  

First of all I do not know how to revert. I just make changes. Second as I am trying to put this version, a very good guy, named roob323 reverts to an older Turkish version of the site. Moreover, now it sounds even ridiculous.The same thing they wrote twice. Just by cutting and pasting from the history of the article. These kids who never went to school in Armenia, whose knowledge about Armenian history comes from church sunday schools write things that can couse laugh even in Turkish readers. For example, in early May recently becamed independent Armenia was attacked by Ottoman forces ( Armenia Georgia and Azerbaijan decalred their independence only in the end of May). Or, after losing the battle of Sardarapat, Armenia declared its independence (second time as a matter of fact). But we all know that the second time Armenia declared its Sovetization (occupation by bolsheviks) on November 29,1920 and not independence. It is very well known that the commander in the battle of Sardarapat was Daniel Bek Pirumov from the village of Nakhichevanik in Nagorno Karabakh. SO fat these 2 imbeciles named Nareklm and roob keep pushing the name Slkuni or Silician.  And finall,y who needs the aftermath of the battle in Sardarapat if it concludes information about what Georgia did, who it asked for help etc etc etc. I am surprized to find out from the article edited by roob and narek that Turkish army occupied the whole Armenia(including Russian part which is todays Armenia). Probably Nagorno Karabakh or Zangezur or Sevan they do not consider a part of Armenia anymore. Moreover, in the history of this article also edited by some turks and Narek you can find out that Armenia was forced to sign treaty of Batumi!!!!!You can see how come 3 not literate (angraget in Armenian) imbeciles can come and do things in wikipedia that Turkish and Azeri propagandists could not even see in their dreams.

I'm specifically going over all of the """"World History-Americas"""" articles. I believe the article currently meets the majority of the criteria and should remain listed as a Good article. In reviewing the article, I have found there are some issues that may need to be addressed. I have made multiple corrections and have included several points below that need to be addressed for the article to remain a GA. Please address them within seven days and if progress is being made then the article will remain listed as a Good article. Otherwise, it may be delisted. If improved after it has been delisted, it may be nominated at WP:GAN. Here are the points that need to be addressed:
Expand the lead to better summarize the article. It should mention a little bit about each heading within the article. The current two sentences isn't sufficient in describing the article. For guidelines, see WP:LEAD. The first paragraph in the background sections reads like part of the lead, consider rewording part of it and merging it into the current lead.
""""Many subsequent historians have considered the causes of the duel to be flimsy and have thus either characterized Hamilton as """"suicidal"""", Burr as """"malicious and murderous,"""" or both."""" Single sentence shouldn't stand alone. Either expand on it or incorporate it into another paragraph. Go through the rest of the article and fix any other occurrences.
""""When the original pistol was examined, the concealed hair trigger was discovered. (Reference: """"Pistols shed light on famed duel,"""" Smithsonian magazine, November 1976)"""" This reference should be converted to an inline citation.
This is not required, but consider converting the url inline citations to the templates used at WP:CITET.

Needs inline citations:
""""The most famous duel in American history..."""" If this is going to be stated a citation needs to be included.
""""...partook in """"hooliganish"""" behavior in..."""" If """"hooliganish"""" is in quotation marks, then it needs to have a source directly after the sentence.
""""There, after much debate and tight gridlocking, the influence of Alexander Hamilton, a very respected Federalist persuaded Federalists that Jefferson was the lesser of two evils.""""
""""It claimed to describe """"a still more despicable opinion which General Hamilton has expressed of Mr. Burr"""" at a political dinner.""""
""""In a letter delivered by William P. Van Ness, Burr demanded """"a prompt and unqualified acknowledgement or denial of the use of any expression which would warrant the assertion of Dr. Cooper"""".""""
""""The bullet ricocheted off Hamilton's second or third false rib—fracturing it—and caused considerable damage to his internal organs, particularly his liver and diaphragm before becoming lodged in his first or second lumbar vertebra.""""
""""...“Pendleton knows I did not mean to fire at Col. Burr the first time”.""""
""""In addition, Hamilton had been reported as having severe mood swings, characteristic of a manic-depressive starting as early as 1800. If Hamilton was indeed manic-depressive, his intentions for dueling with Burr may have been psychologically delusional.""""
""""the same pair which had once shot a button off of Aaron Burr's coat some five years earlier during a duel with Hamilton's brother-in-law""""
""""The guns are on display in the Executive Conference center of 277 Park Avenue in Manhattan.""""

I'll leave messages on the talk pages of the contributors of this article (using WikiDashBoard) along with any related WikiProjects so that the workload can be shared.

 Trivia section 

I've just removed this (again). Per WP:Trivia, there should be not be trivia sections in articles. →talk  

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WP:TRIV#What_this_guideline_is_not

There are a number of pervasive misunderstandings about this guideline and the course of action it suggests:

 This guideline does not suggest removing trivia sections, or moving them to the talk page. - If information is otherwise suitable, it is better that it be poorly presented than not presented at all.
 This guideline does not suggest always avoiding lists in favor of prose. - Some information is better presented in a list format.
 This guideline does not suggest omitting unimportant material. - This guideline does not attempt to address the issue of what information is included or not — only how it is organized.

that is not what the above guideline seems to state. 

 Capped off His Cap in Style?? 
 
So much for NPOV there.  What is with the """"who just capped off his career in style"""" line?  Not only is that not keeping with a neutral theme, it is an update that really can't last more than a few weeks once he joins the Galaxy.

 I'd say it's factually wrong, cos he hasn't finished his career, so he hasn't """"capped his career"""" at all yet.  Removing.  If someone objects, they can put it back and give reasons why here. 
 Additional words: OK, it does say """"capped off his Real Madrid career"""" so it isn't factually wrong.  Changed line anyway to something more plain, but agree that intro should probably be reworked as it doesn't read completely encyclopaedic. 

 Lead section too long 

In my opinion, the lead section needs a serious overhaul, as it's to large and encompasses to many points that could and should be in the main article (see Wikipedia:Lead section).  (Yabba Dabba Doo!) 
The lead is ridiculous at the moment. I would have a go at cutting it down but it's best waiting until   the article is more stable. →talk  

Dave  The guidelines say the lead should be about four paragraphs, but that would be the norm.  David Beckham is not a normal article, as the subject is a major figure in current news now.  I agree wholeheartedly with your post here.  I am going to try to help make it shorter.
 

 Multiple links

_______________________________________________________________________

I have no problem with the Boeing report, but its conclusion is for tether lengths that are much longer than the ones that are being discussed in this article.  This is where your lack of knowledge about engineering is a problem.
The mass of a space tether goes up with length.  Assuming it could take the thermal environment, you can build a space tether out of kite string.  But there is a limit on how long this space tether could be made based on the strength to weight ratio of the string.  This is where designers start making tapered lines that have more cross sectional area in the middle than at the ends.  Even with this there are still limits on the length based on cost and total mass.  You can make an Earth surface to geostationary orbit space elevator using kite string but it will be larger than the Earth, hence not practical.  That doesn't mean that you still can't use that kite string to fly a kite, obviously you can.  The difference is in the length.  The space elevator is 100,000 km long.  Your kite string is only a few hundred feet at most.  The same applies to skyhooks.  You could build a 100,000 km long space elevator out of T1000GB carbon fibers but it would have near planetary mass and as a result isn't practical.  But like the much shorter kite string for flying a kite, a skyhook made of carbon fibers in the 200 km to 4,000 km range is possible.
As to the references not all being open source on the internet there is not much I can do about that.  You will need to either pay for them or go to a university library that pays for access to them and have them downloaded.  References 7, 18, and 19 are open source.  Reference 19 is only for the part of that paper that covers non-rotating skyhooks and does not include the entire paper.  If you want to see the entire paper do a search using the title on google, it is open source.  
Quite simply the information is out there but you will have to do a little digging or pay for it.  You will also need a basic understanding of engineering and orbital mechanics in regards to space tethers.  For that I recommend the """"Tether in Space Handbook"""", it is also open source on the internet, see reference 7.
You could also just read the abstracts for the non-open source papers and you will get an idea that this is a workable concept.  Or you could just notice who is writing these reports; NASA, reference 19, Lockheed Martin, references 5, 8, 9, and 10, and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, reference 7.  Do you really think these organizations would be wasting their time and money on a lie?

To conclude with the Boeing report.  The Boeing report says 
1) """"His analysis showed that because a hanging tether must be tapered to support its lower end in the gravitational field of the Earth, achieving a HyperSkyhook tether tip rendezvous with a 5.0 km/s (16 kft/s or Mach 16) airplane would require a HyperSkyhook tether mass of 25 times the payload mass.""""

5.0 km/s is 64% of low Earth orbit velocity.  A tether mass of 25 times payload mass can be built.  I have no argument with this.

2) """"Trying to lower the tether tip speed to 4.0 km/s (13 kft/s or Mach 13) would require a HyperSkyhook tether mass greater than 200 times the payload mass.""""

4.0 km/s is 51% of low Earth orbit velocity.  A tether mass of 200 times payload mass sounds about right and it is highly unlikely that such a tether length would be economic.  Again no disagreement.

The tether tip speeds for the non-rotating skyhook examples in this article, and in all the references I have listed, start at 96% of low Earth orbit velocity and go to approximately 70% of low Earth orbit velocity.  There is no reason to go any lower.
As a result, the final line of the Boeing quote, """"In general, the non-spinning tether HyperSkyhook concept does not look competitive with the spinning tether concepts. """" does not apply for two reasons.  1) It doesn't apply to the skyhook lengths in the article, and 2) it is an unfounded over generalization that falls under the category of sales BS that is promoting rotating skyhooks.

Do you now understand how the Boeing quote that you are so fond of does not apply to the non-rotating skyhooks in this article?

PS  The reference numbers are for the article as I have written it.  Since you keep deleting references with your changes, the reference numbers keep changing, hence you will need to use the article as I have written it if you want the reference numbers quoted here to mean anything.

So please, read this until you understand it and do your research to confirm what I and many others are saying.

The message you left me was rather offensive, it's not like I'm vandalising Wikipedia. 77.250.200.70  
The fact that it is so famous is of extremely important encyclopedic value, since most readers will have no knowledge of the fact that the Ajax Academy is any more important than the Chelsea Academy (for example). The Chelsea Academy has in fact been modeled on the Ajax academy, and has been implemented by Piet de Visser and Henk ten Cate (well until Grant was fired). The Barcelona academy was totally based on the Ajax Academy and was implemented when Cruyff was manager there. These are historical facts and it's not like I'm some kind of marketing executive from Dubai trying to say that Manchester City has the best academy ever. Incidentally, the Ajax Academy in it's current form was originally set up by Rinus Michels, who is credited with the invention of a major football tactic known as """"Total Football"""" (as played by Ajax, Barcelona, and Arsenal today) and was named """"coach of the century"""" by FIFA in 1999.

Baroque Guitars are NOT """"ten-string guitars""""

Andrew, frankly, you are mistaken. It is incorrect to refer to a baroque guitar as a """"ten-string guitar"""". No one refers to the baroque lute as """"the 24-string lute"""", but correctly as the 13-course lute. This is a well-established musicological/organological convention. """"12-string guitar"""" is the only exception to this, and that is only because the term has been disseminated by the popular """"cult(ure)"""" in the usual brainwashed ignorance of the masses. If two strings function as one string, they are a COURSE, not two separate strings. In contrast, a ten-stringed guitar has ten separate strings each of which can be separately fretted. This is not the case on the baroque guitar, which effectively only has five courses. Moreover, the term """"ten-string"""" guitar has come to signify a particular instrument, which is NOT a baroque guitar. You are evidently not a musicologist/organologist/semiologist/semantician so I don't see what you think you will achieve by being bothersome about this issue, which relates to organology and semantics.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I think the cascade of abusive comments directed at the checkusers were more than enough justification for blocking for disruption; common sense says you don't come ask for help and then start taking swings at the people you're asking for help. By the way, just for future note by anyone watching, the reason that it takes a while to get a response is because we have to deal with things like this; if people were, you know, patient/pleasant/appreciative, then we might be a bit more inclined to run checks. As it stands, we gain very little but constant abuse from all sides for volunteering our time to do this.  (Talk)

 Attempt to fly the aircraft upside-down? 

There's one sentence that seems to lack support: At one point, unable to raise the nose, they attempted to fly the aircraft """"upside-down"""".

This implies that the pilots deliberately tried to invert the plane, or at least keep it inverted after an unintended roll. Certainly the aircraft was inverted. But there doesn't seem to be any evidence that the inversion was deliberate. The CVR transcript (which is the only reference cited by this sentence) seems consistent with the notion that the inversion was unintended and that the pilots were trying to right the aircraft.

So unless anyone knows of any citable source saying that the inversion was deliberate, I think this sentence should be changed. Especially because it can be confused with the movie Flight, where, in a similar situation, the pilots do deliberately attempt to invert the aircraft.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

My Reverting of The Edit In The History Section
I didn't revert the edit because the material you removed isn't redundant in some ways, which is fairly obvious if you read the  section as a whole. The entire history section of this article is still in very bad shape in my opinion, I'd suggest that its got non NPOV issues in several spots, the tone it's written in and choice of words seem somewhat """"chatty"""" and unencyclopedic to me and worst of all it continues to contain, what I'd argue, are historical inaccuracies in some places. Instead of editing out the paragraph that was removed today, which contained a link to a map, as well as an internal link to the ongoing Caledonia land dispute, a subject quite relevant in the Grand Valley these days, I'd like to see the entire history section itself brought up to a higher standard. In my opinion, from a historical perspective, the article itself would benefit more if some of the earlier comments in it regarding the acquisition of the land by the Six Nations were edited out and replaced by the material that was removed today. As I said back in August, I'm willing to work on this article myself as time allows, but in my opinion it doesn't make sense removing content that's not only relevant and contains references, it's actually of a higher quality than what remains.

Against that, biographical details of Roberts are slim.  He committed his crime aged thirty, hid out for a few months, and has been in jail for forty years.  Prior to the crime, he had done little of note to appear in a biography.  He has done very little of note for forty years.  Some more detail about his earlier life is probably available, but it would need a lot of leg-work around newspaper cuttings libraries to find it, and many newspaper archives of this nature went in a skip years ago without digital copies being made.

Yes, you have time to edit-war and restore the article to promotional version but not to edit to correct it. When corrected by some other editor, you claim it not to be perfect and do revert repeatedly. I see no good in promotional and unsourced tone and contents based purely on primary source.

Edit-warring? Did I make any edit without leaving an edit summary? It is you, despite discussing the concerns on here, you went on to make revert multiple times. I'm very much disappointed to see apparently an established editor behaving, yes, much likely to a WP:NOTHERE editor. It is you, who chooses to revert instead discussing the changes. You came here to leave a comment only after making a revert. Did you notice it? You choose to post a warning template on my talk page, instead initiating a discussion on article's talk page.

Richard confirms above that there are two interpretations of probability, Bayesian and frequentist.  Although they both should give the same answer to any exact question it is very confusing to flip interpretation in the middle of an argument.  I am happy to discuss the MHP using either model but let us start with the Bayesian perspective first.

To a Bayesian, probability is a state of knowledge.  That is the definition of what Bayesian probability means.  In the Bayesian model, what is not known does not exist.  That is not something  that I have just made up, I am sure Richard will confirm it or you can confirm it using WP or any good text book.  So, if the player does not know where the car is placed, or the host's door opening strategy, the probability of winning by switching is exactly 2/3.  It may be that the car is always placed behind door 2 and the host always opens door 3 but, if we do not know that, it makes no difference to our (Bayesian) probability calculation, which depends by definition only on the information that we have, .  The concept of average probability makes no sense, there is just 'the probability' which is based only on our state of knowledge.",0,0,0,0,0,0

I don't know how large your local paper is; my experience with larger papers is that they verify the author to at least a basic degree (believe me, the items I was writing about are not nearly as contentious as the matter at hand here, nor am I in a position akin to the rector's.) And in a situation like this, there would certainly be a correction if the rector claimed the letter wasn't his, and no such correction appears. As such, that the rector made the statement seems to me quite adequately sourced, even if the claims he makes are not. However, if you would like to slightly reword it to make it even clearer that the rector is making claims that are not otherwise in evidence (replacing stated with claimed or asserted), I would not have an objection.
I think the claim, even if treated as true, is not much of a claim; the count of accused priests has an invisible """"yet"""" hanging over it, as more recent graduates would have had less time to have accusers come forward than those from previous classes. And I think the reference is good to have in there for something it -doesn't- include; the letter is essentially a """"yes, but"""" note rather than a """"no"""" note, as it doesn't deny anything in the Times article and thus to some degree blunts any objection that it's just the Times reporters say-so.

My answer: 
Jusus article has 100% images of Jesus which are accepted/used/associated about Jesus in 90% of Christianians.

Muhammad article 100% images of Muhammad which are accepted/used/associated about Muhammad in 0.1% of Muslims as well as nonmuslims in all the history.

If there is an image which represents and is associated to Muhammad in mainstream Muslims/nonMuslims then use it.

 Disambiguation Links 

Hi Evilbu,

What I changed on the Quadric (projective geometry) page was simply an incorrectly directed link to a disambiguation page.  The link to """"field"""" had been linking to field, which is the disambiguation page for the word """"field"""", but I changed it to link to the correct page, field (mathematics).  

What you went to when you clicked on the """"you can help"""" link should have taken you to Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links, which is a wiki fixup project.  The project works to fix all wikilinks that link to disambiguation pages, and instead have the links link the specific article that they refer to.
Let me know if you have any other questions, and I hope you continue contributing to Wikipedia!

First off,  T.N.E. has always had a strong division in its organization early on. If you happen to be T.N.E. from Wesleyan today, you probalbly know very little about all the details of the organization. You are basing it on Wesleyans records alone, while I am using both sources from both Alfa chapters. I'm sorry if you don't like that reality, or if you want to believe that the T.N.E. that you know of today is the correct or only version of the society, but that is simply not historically true, and Purdue is even mentioned as """"Indiana Alpha"""" within Wesleyan's own current T.N.E. website. T.N.E. has also sufferered greatly from disorganization by these two Alphas, and the T.N.E. of Purdue today that requires tapped membership has nothing to do with the T.N.E. organization of Weslyans Alpha Chapter. I even suspect that there may be a second T.N.E. chapter at Purdue that is associated with Weslyan's current outfit.  T.N.E. of Wesleyan now is acting much more like a social fraternity than a traditional secret society of Skull & Bones, and yes, Purdue's chapter was established on the 50th anniversary of Skull and Bones as an important engineering and aviation branch. It is believed that Neil Armstrong, the first person that walked on the moon, was T.N.E of tapped Purdue membership. Moreover, If you want to believe that the page as it stands in your version is correct, why than is both Purdue and Bodoin  listed as the same name, """"Alphs Alpha"""", how can this be possible? It is so becuase the Wesylian branch never had accurate records of Purdue Alpha. Also, the waterdowned version of T.N.E. that you know of today is really a start up after a substantial period of inactivity. I suspect, that at best, the mainstreamed version of T.N.E. that you know of may have some secrets of the organization's original initiation rights preserved, but have lost all of the more substatial secrets of the society, secrets that unfortunately were never recorded but passed on by verbal means from generation to generation in the same mannner of Skull and Bones today. This is why the current T.N.E. claims in their website that there are no true secrets to T.N.E., but it is more accurate to say that there are no true secrets to Weslyan's T.N.E. outfit as it stands today. This is not to say that T.N.E. or even Skull & Bones have some sort of conspiracy, but there were definetly early American secrets about the culture of this nation's forefathers that were kept private, secrets that were Masonic in tradition that both S & B and Purdue's group have maintained. That bond of trust has then also been translated into trust on a governmental level. Not a conspiracy, but just a fact of human nature, pleople prefer to deal with life's most important matters with other peple that they can depend on and trust. My suggestion is to do your homework before you delete, and continue to enjoy your T.N.E. club and leave proper history to the experts. I specialize in collegiate secret societies.

I understand the concept of harmonious editing, and I agree with it as a priority second only to making sure that relevant information is not subverted.  Information is not an enemy of an honorable person, but we see influential people here at Wikipedia who do little more than strip pertinent data from articles or delete entire pages of unique and beneficial knowledge.  These people play little games of waffling back and forth between demands for sources and, when they get sources, questions of relevance. (See Talk:State_terrorism for example.)  When their opponent suggests that they are being less than honest in doing so, these people block them for making personal comments.

Random Question
Hi.  I am a rather biology noob, hopefully this question doesn't sound strange.  I am curious as to whether it is possible for stem cell creation to one day reach a peak where we can replace animal Slaughterhouse?  Forget about the economic factor for a minute.  Is it theoretically possible to feed a nation with meat that was grown 100% in a lab and not killed from any animal??  I had a thought that animals would benefit greatly from this.   
Um, you could grow either stem cells or non-stem cells in some sort of cell culture system for food, I guess, but it seems like a hideously expensive exercise & you would likely use animal or animal-derived products in their growth. The problem would still be the texture and the flavour''.
Realistically, it would be easier to feed everyone with soya flavoured to taste like meat. I've read that the entire underdeveloped world could be easily fed using the grain the US alone feeds its livestock (not sure if that's true though). Eating meat is costsly, and in vitro meat would be even moreso. The best way to save the animals would be to go vegetarian... but I still like a good steak.  
So you are saying there is never going to be an answer since taste and flavor can never be produced in a lab?  
Not never, just that I suspect that taste and flavour will be greater hurdles than growing cells. I don't see why it has to be stem cells that are grown as """"meat"""" - actually you would be better off growing muscle cells, as it is the muscle (and some fat) that is what is in a typical steak.  

In this line:  """"In the future, medical researchers anticipate being able to use technologies derived from stem cell research to treat a wider variety of diseases including cancer, parkinson's disease, spinal cord injuries, and muscle damage, amongst a number of other impairments and conditions.""""

 Advice on Portal:Jurassic Park: 

Hi Firs. I recently found the mentioned portal after it was placed in the related portals section of the dino portal. I checked it out & saw it had a number of problems which were in violation of the fair use policy among others. Firstly, none of the pictures on the portal (all of which are fair use) have fair use rationale. I expressed this to the user (User:Cuddly Panda) who has been the sole contributor of the portal with no reply. On closer inspection, it seems the user has been uploading & adding fair use images to wikipedia for some time now, possibly upwards of a year, & despite numerous warning from automated bots etc, has now seemed to learn from this or the links provided or ceased their image infringements. Just check out the user's talk page - nearly every message is a message about the misuse of uploads. In addition to this, the portal is very poor in quality, unmaintained and relies heavily on unfree images and poor portal sections (some of which have already been nominated for deletion). So I wanted to ask you what action I could take next. There's a few options:

1) Obviously the user is not listening to warnings & my messages, so could I possibly bring this up at the administrator's noticeboard? They could then decide what to do next.
2) Since sections of the JP Portal are being nomianted for deletion already, I could potentially nominate the whole portal at MfD with a vote of """"no opinion"""". This would see what other editors think of the portal & even if it is kept, the portal's fair use pictures problem would still be sorted out by the end of the nomiantion.
3) I'll probably do this anyway, but the user is on Editor Review & I could also place a note there explaining what the user is doing wrong & how to remedy this.

So, I'd personally like to do all three, but if you can think of something else & help me decide which of those, if any, to carry out, it would be appreciated. I'll post this to another admin just to get a second opinion as well. Cheers,  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Goodbye After 7 years 

Goodbye, after 7 years of editing on here. Quite frankly I have to devote more time to my lectuuring duties and do not have time with the twisted logic of the """"little Hitler"""" administrator who has blocked me, using the reason and logic that """"I should know better"""" therefore be blocked for one week. I was due to stop editing anyway as the amount of edit warring was getting worse on the India related articles and I don't have time for them.

For those moderate and fair minded Muslim, Hindu's, Buddhist's, Christian's and Sikh's I say, keep editing the India related articles. Don't be swayed by the extremists. Remember the principles of Wikipedia, WP:NPOV. Always back it with a WP:Reliable reference. Be WP:Bold. Always be ready to discuss and share ideas. Don't close your mind. It is the close minded people of this world that destroy Logic and Reason.

Live Long and Prosper and see you on the lecturing circuit.

Dear Colleagues, 
I thank the various administrators and editors for their patience, and for their comments here, on the various talk pages and by email. Many comments have been made about procedural failures. Each of my steps in the dispute resolution process is prefaced with a request for advice and direction about how to do this properly, as I note here, because I did not know how to request, or manage, an ANI conduct review or MEDCOM mediation properly. A decision to block me was made, which I will not contest, based on comprehensive notes from two editors and accusations that I provide no evidence. I did not know how or when to do so, but I am learning quickly. In regard to arguments made by the editors  and , above, and upon which a decision was made to block me, I respond as follows:
 I reviewed a long history of contentious discussion and edits in Historicity of Jesus.
 I then posted a bold sourced here, which I encourage you to examine. You may see that they are in some cases minor clarifications, in others short simple neutrally toned presentations of divergent academic perspectives. In each instance the sources provided, apply only to the conceptual background of the claims made, and do not pertain to the specific line by line claims of this article, because, the citations largely concern the framework of the discussion not its extensive particulars.
 I started a talk page discussion
 Smeat75 reverted my edit without discussion here
 Smeat75 responded to my talk page discussion, but did not address the reasoning for the revision, here
 I continued discussion on the talk page and reverted back my edits here
 Ian.thomson reverted my edit with note of """"You must develop consensus"""" here
 I reverted with note """"""""Local consensus"""" is opposed by Wikipedia:Editing policy. Wait for external review."""" here
 I requested external review at WP:RFC and continued discussion on the Talk page here
 Ian.thomson reverted the edit I requested review on, again, here
 External review collapsed as editors ignored process and comments from external parties
 I had been following what I knew of appropriate policy and felt I was being repeatedly reverted without discussion or attempts to communicate, so...
 I then requested Dispute Resolution here, please read """"dispute overview""""
 Dispute resolution was opened, great comments received from many editors, and closed unresolved, as explained here
 On advice of DRN I applied to ANI for advice on resolution of conduct conflicts here, and to MEDCOM for content mediation here
 MEDCOM opened the request, 5 editors to date have agreed to mediation
 ANI administrator then blocked me without addressing my request for advice, nor making inquiries with me and apparently based solely on the comments of two editors about which I have conduct concerns.

The evidence is in the photographs of Margherita and her family and my father's family - obvious close genetic similarities. Also in some common personality characteristics. I have no documentary proof of course. Remember I was born in Brooklyn just at the start of WWII and my mother intentionally dropped the final """"i"""" in my birth certificate to hide the connection. Everything was done to cover up the connection for obvious reasons since we were at war with Italy at the time. The best evidence I have is from my Aunt Victoria Sarfatti as related above. Also when I was in Brazil with Fred Alan Wolf in 1984 wined and dined by the wealthiest people in Brazil, an older woman came up to me and said, """"I knew Margherita Sarfatti."""" She simply assumed I was her blood relative from looking at me. I made no mention of the connection at that meeting. It was not relevant. In any case that is really not the point. The point is the artistic and occult connections as shown in my 1980 meeting with David Padwa - a very odd occult tale of high strangeness told in detail in """"Destiny Matrix"""" with a corroborating photograph.

Hi I42 (hope I spelled it right),

you wanted deleting the article about the American Post hardcore band Save Our Souls. Well I found something which might help the article to get notable for the en:WP.

I found the official festival poster for the Sunset Strip Music Festival 2010. The band played together with bands like The Smashing Pumpkins, Volbeat, Lost Patrol, Kid Cudi and Slash. [http://pulserecordings.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/SSMF2010_Poster_11x17_web-610x924.jpg

They will play together with Slayer drummer Dave Lombardo at the Whisky A Go-Go on the September 19tn, 2010 and they will play at the Las Vegas Hilton, where the band invited directors and producers of the Universal Studios.

Yes, I agree wholeheartedly with that. I'm from Amsterdam, The Netherlands, myself. I've been in France and other European countries back in the disco era, and what we call """"disco"""" is encompassing much more than what is being made of it here. For instance, loads of really good disco music was made in Italy, Germany, France and even here in The Netherlands, because there was a lot of money in mafia to buy the early synthesizers. Moroder, for one, was an Italian living in Munich when the Donna Summer hits were created I believe. Disco to us here therefore also includes music by Gino Soccio, Cowley, Moroder himself (not only his Donna Summer work) plus many Italian producers. When I see this page, it's as if Europe didn't influence the genre, while it is the other way around in many ways. It wasn't Chicago or London where house-music started, even, the first fast-paced housey acidy music came from Italy, Germany and The Netherlands if you ask me. Take for example 'Remember' by Vivien Vee from 1977, and 'Crazy Family' by Jock Hattle, the long version from 1982. They both have long-lasting breaks in them, perfect examples of disco that would now be called """"house"""" or maybe even """"trance"""" for parts of them.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Firstly, I am not fixated on, nor am I carrying on a dispute with, Epeefleche, and I certainly have no desire to get into any conflict with them. If you are not prepared to accept that then my posting any further unblock request would be pointless.For what it's worth, my attention was drawn to the article in question by additions made by Epeefleche to several golfer biographies which are on my watchlist. I first posted a message on Epeefleche's talk page explaining the minor changes I had made to those additions to those articles to try and negate any potential for conflict. I also explained the obvious issue I had noticed with the inclusion criteria for that list, before posting on the article talk page. I do not think either of those edits were disruptive or confrontational in any way, and thought I had responded in a reasonable manner to all Epeefleche's comments, while trying to return the focus onto the article. I repeat, I do not wish to engage in any dispute or conflict with Epeefleche or any other contributor and that remains the case. I cannot be any clearer on that.I have acknowledged that I should not have engaged in repeated reverting, and I see how that could potentially inflame things even more than usual in this instance.Yes, my response to Greg L was over the top and I should have done as I usually do – don't click the save page button and just ignore it, but it's too late now. bigissue """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Please be aware that deleting comments made by other users is frowned upon on wikipedia. 

In this particular case, the discussion was started by user Brad, who made a personal comment about me. Now, I dont mind this, I was more curious than offended, but the comment clearly ridicules the debate which I started on Wikipedia talk:Naming conventions (ships)‎. You claimed that my post which you deleted was a 'POV inserted into a neutral notice'. It may have been a POV, about the desireability of starting any major change sooner rather than later, but this was in response to another comment suggesting that the proposed change would produce lots of work, and thus the implicit POV that it was undesireable. It was no more than a response in kind to the previous posting.  If you are going to start censoring postings, then I would suggest you do so impartially.  You did not censor the response in a way which restored the original section to a short notice, but merely removed one comment. Rather than restoring impartiality, this might be seen as biasing the tone of the debate.

 semi-protect request 

Do you know how to put in sem-protects? I'd like on on pseudophilosophy and Patrecia Scott as Alienus is using new sockpuppets to edit these. Thanks.  

Hello: this request for semi-protection on two articles is out of process  the user making the request is in a content dispute with multiple editors, and has provided no valid evidence, nor requested Checkuser to support the claim that any banned sockpuppets are editing. Editing from anon-IPs is not reason enough; particularly when the request for semi-protection comes from an editor with a  who wishes to protect his version of the article.Talk 

 Most requests for administrative intervention come from editors with an interest in the topic.  That doesn't invalidate the request, or change the fact that Alienus is not permitted to edit Wikipedia by the order of the Arbcom.  Hope that helps.   
There's been no actual evidence that any vandalism or editing by Alienus has occurred at those articles. Claiming an IP address is a banned user without proof is inappropriate, and contrary to semi-protection policy, which states,

Semi-protection should not be used:

As a preemptive measure against vandalism before any vandalism has occurred.
As a response to regular content disputes, since it may restrict some editors and not others (see the protection policy for how to deal with this).
In the case of a static IP vandal hitting a page (blocking is preferable to semi-protection).
...
To prohibit anonymous editing in general.
Talk 

 I'm pretty satisfied that the thing that is quacking, waddling, and shedding feathers is, in fact, a duck.  
When making a claims contrary to WP:AGF, it might be a good idea to actually have evidence. Can you show any edit in the  recent history of Pseudophilosophy that was either 1) vandalism or 2) an edit by a banned user? Likewise, can you show that in  Patrecia Scott  IPs 207.210.106.104 or  128.197.11.30 are the banned user Alienus, as claimed? All I see is a content dispute, and edit-warring by LaszloWalrus and for that you are not permitted to semi-protect an article. In fact, the content in the latter article that LaszloWalrus keeps removing is in the Nathaniel Branden article: """"In 1968, the close relationship between Rand and Branden came to an abrupt end when Rand discovered that Branden was having a sexual relationship with a third woman, actress Patrecia Scott. Rand then expelled Branden from the Objectivist movement.""""Talk 
 Look more closely.  Good day.   
 That certainly is not an answer; it's your responsibility to demonstrate that you're using Admin powers appropriately. If necessary, I'll bring this up at RFC for Admin conduct.Talk 
 I encourage you to do whatever you think is best.  Regards,  
Umm, I'm editing Pseudophilosophy and the gentleman in question seems only to remove the sections that he does not support.  Most of that is cited material, or documented on Ayn Rand's own page.  It is not novel or disputed, just not liked.  I think we need to be wary of such edits and protections.  If he is doing this elsewhere, that is even more problematic.  I have noticed that at least one time he reverted on the basis of 'alienus' from an anon ip, it did not look like a sockpuppet edit, and i think the continued use of this justification is being used as a trope for a campaign.  It should be ignored and forgotten.

6142887fe5d1bf7c,"I just mentioned the social conflict, because the contemporary crisis of Judaism was less a conflict between Orthodox and Reform movement, but a social gap between a ruling minority, consisting of families which had bound together religious authorities, academics and wealthy merchants through marriages, and a ruled majority in the Jewish communities and town ghettos whose poverty had dramatically increased. This is not only the social context of the conflicts between Maskilim and Orthodox Rabbis or Maskilim and Reform Rabbis, but also between Orthodox authorities and mystic movements like Hasidism. Hasidim in Galicia and Bukovina usually understood much better the problems of the poor population than any Maskilim among the West Yiddish Ashkenazim in Alsace or Western regions of Prussia. And Polish nationalists and among them, Polish Jews who lived in the larger Shtetl and visited the universities in Wilna, Warsaw, Cracow and Lemberg, formed a governing elite in the Sejm of Lemberg – the parlament of the crownland Galicia. The rural communities of Galicia was another “uncivilized” world for modern Jews in Vienna, Paris, Budapest, Prague and Berlin. Nachman Krochmal from Galicia as a student of Hegel must have appeared like a mooncalf. Their hopes focussed on a revolution in 1848 and it failed again.

 Moses Mendelssohn certainly belonged to the privileged minority of the Schutzjuden and his circle was the upper class of Prussia, but this does not mean that they were not disappointed about the backwards conditions in Prussia, whatever faith they had. Wealthy members like the brothers Humboldt or Polish aristocrats were very engaged to improve the social conditions. They founded universities, hospitals, they improved the working conditions of coal miners etc. If I compare them with wealthy people today in Germany, I can assure that they were much less ignorant. Otherwise they were also very intolerant people (especially around Fichte in Jena) like the demagogues who cause the hep hep progroms, so Hegel and his pupils had to go the ghetto to protect their inhabitants...

 But like David Friedländer Moses Mendelssohn’s social sphere had an impact on his concept of modern Judaism. As a pedagogue he wanted to teach Jewish children German, Hebrew and Greek, but he refused Yiddish as a corrupt dialect, which finally meant to refuse the prospering culture (literature and drama) of East Yiddish and the Ashkenazim world from Wilna to Bucarest. From the point of view of Alsatian Ashkenazim, Mendelssohn was admired as a radical philosopher of Haskalah, but the reason behind his radical attitude was the extreme pressure of assimilation, that the Jewish population had to suffer in Prussia. For this reason I was a little bit surprised about your categorization of Moses Mendelssohn as an Orthodox Jew. Conversion finally remained the main access into the ruling elite of Prussia which can be easily analyzed by the cynical statements of Heinrich Heine (especially his commentaries of the Pietist circles around the children and grandchildren: “He [Felix] is the grandson of the great philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, but he has nothing better to do than to set the lamb’s piss into music!”).

 I just collect here all these names and places, in order to demonstrate how open the category of Reform Judaism should be. And I still see no reason how to exclude Moses Mendelssohn.",0,0,0,0,0,0

f632c8f9eff82d84,"On the fringes of any nation the melting pot effect is less pronounced. The homogenisation of England did not permeate beyond the Tamar into the Cornish peninsular until the later half of the 19th century, and it is this fact that gives rise to a separate Cornish identity. In the rest of England the Celtic identity of the Britons was subsumed by the waves of Anglo-Saxon, Danish and Norman invasions, but the King on the throne of England has been the Cornish people’s overlord for some 1200 years. Even so, the Cornish language aside (of which there has not been one native speaker for 150 years), I wonder if this identity is any really any stronger that that of Yorkshire. A Yorkshireman has a distinct identity different from much of England but very few would not claim England to be the nation of their birth.

In the 19th century a Cockney and a Geordie meeting for the first time would have found great difficulty communicating, though they were speaking the same tongue, but both would have been sure they were living in England. England was until relatively recently a land of containing many regional identities and has only relatively recently started to become a blurry single entity. What is England and Englishness anyway? Is it drinking tea?, or eating roast beef?, or playing cricket? or a sense of fair play?, or belief in trial by jury?, or a particular sense of humour? If it is anyone of these I don’t see how the Cornish differ from the English.

Leaving aside these philosophical issues and returning to the realpolitik as sjc calls it the situation is clear. The Cornish nation ceased to exist some 1200 years ago and the duchy of Cornwall is irrelevant to the governmental administration of the region. It is administered by a county council fairly elected by the inhabitants many of whom are happy to call themselves English. Some are not, but some Scots nationalists dislike being called British, the fact remains that Scotland is in Britain (UK) similarly those Cornish people may dislike being called English cannot get away from the fact that as it stands Cornwall remains a county in England until a Cornish nation is re-established. Despite the aspirations of Cornish nationalists/separatists and despite the anachronistic state of affairs regarding the Duchy of Cornwall, Cornwall is currently a county in England and to fail to describe it as such is simply erroneous. It would be a misrepresentation of the facts to state otherwise. 

As for the arguments regarding the specific wording of this article, as long as it continues to state that 'Cornwall is a county of Great Britain' or similar avoidance of the words 'county in England', new readers will contineu to try to correct it back to 'county in England' because rightly or wrongly, that's what everybody apart from a small minority (and as far as Wikipedia is concerned I think it's a minority of one), perceive it to be. 00:41 Sep 10, 2002 (UTC)",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hi Tony, as far as I know, once you are a user in one Wikipedia, somehow you become a user in all/most of the others (including for example, Commons). I may be wrong in this, however I don't remember having created a user id and password in the Spanish Wikipedia yet I have an account there.

In any event, part of the “secret” has something to do with something called “unified logins” and you can find which wikipedias you are “attached” to by going to >>>>  My Preferences > Basic Information > Global Account status > Manage your global account

I don’t know how it decides which wikis to attach you to and which ones not (for example, I am not attached to Wikitravel), but what the heck? it works for the Spanish, English, and Commons which is where I spend 99% of my wiki time.

I have been editing the Spanish Wikipedia and will probably do so even more in the future: it allows me to reach the other 50% of Puerto Ricans that don’t read English fluently. (Check out my article in teh Spanish wiki for Millito Navarro – I started by translating it from the English Wiki and now the Spanish version is not only more complete than the English counterpart, but also has 3x the references, is more current and, probably most importantly, it has an accurracy that can be backed up 100%. You know, I can't be contect with incomplete articles if the rest of teh info is readily available.) 

I will be more than happy to fulfill you request for the move; and have already sone so.  I had read negative comments about the Spanish Wikipedia related to how much more problematic it was to edit, how editors there didn’t know what they where doing, and how there seem to be not a fully developed system for dealing with conflicts etc. Some (a little?) of that may be true; the rest may be perception only. I am learning the ropes there and stay out of trouble by creating/editing article most people don’t care about for now (read: Ponce – haha), but once interest develops I know I have the truth well “under my belt” to deal with the sporadic drive-by editor that wants to make changes based on unacceptable motives (personal, political, etc – you know what I am talking about) rather than verifiable truth.   

Also, its very easy to jump (to appear logged in and all) from one wiki to the other: just take an article in the English wiki which you know also exists in Spanish wiki and hit the link on the left that says “Spanish” and bingo!!!! you are there! I use “Cerro de Punta” because it exists in both wikis AND because it is short and, thus, I don’t have to scroll down to see the “Spanish” link.

 Signpost exit poll  
Dear Wikipedian, you recently voted in the ArbCom election.  Your username, along with around 155 other usernames of your fellow Wikipedians, was randomly selected from the 2000+ Wikipedians who voted this year, with the help of one of the election-commissioners.  If you are willing, could you please participate (at your option either on-wiki via userspace or off-wiki via email) in an exit poll, and answer some questions about how you decided amongst the ArbCom candidates? 

  If you decide to participate in this exit poll, the statistical results will be published in the Signpost, an online newspaper with over 1000 Wikipedians among the readership.  There are about twelve questions, which have alphanumerical answers; it should take you a few minutes to complete the exit poll questionnaire, and will help improve Wikipedia by giving future candidates information about what you think is important.  This is only an unofficial survey, and will have no impact on your actual vote during this election, nor in any future election.  

  All questions are individually optional, and this entire exit poll itself is also entirely optional, though if you choose not to participate, I would appreciate a brief reply indicating why you decided not to take part (see Question Zero).  Thanks for being a Wikipedian

 The questionnaire  
Dear Wikipedian, please fill out these questions  at your option via usertalk or via email, see Detailed Instructions at the end of the twelve questions  by putting the appropriate answer in the blanks provided.  If you decide not to answer a question (all questions are optional), please put the reason down:  """"undecided"""" / """"private information"""" / """"prefer not to answer"""" / """"question is not well-posed"""" / """"other: please specify"""".  Although the Signpost cannot guarantee that complex answers can be processed for publication, it will help us improve future exit polls, if you give us comments about why you could not answer specific questions.

Undo the merge!

i say we undo the merge and fix up the problems with the old stuff   

It isn't going to happen.  Collectonian (talk · contribs) 

Consensus is not immutable, and this seems like as good a proposal as any.  Let's see what the 
community as a whole has to say.  I'm in favor of it because of the abysmal coverage of the current article.  If, when the old articles are sourced, organized and cleaned up, there is still so little material that it can all be summarized on one page, then it could be merged.  If someone who can still edit the article made a note of this suggestion in the anime sections it would probably be good.  I can do it when the lock is lifted if no one else has. 72.160.96.228  

No it isn't """"as good a proposal as any."""" Its already been covered within the last week that the consensus to merge is valid and that it HAS consensus. Get over all ready, gravy. You hate it so damn much, go to the DB wikia.  Collectonian (talk · contribs) 

Since this whole mess started I've been contributing over there regularly.  It's nice to be part of a worthwhile project.  Unfortunately it doesn't seem like that's what this part of Wikipedia is anymore. 207.118.67.139  

Recbon, ideally what you suggest would happen, but these days in Wikipedia everyone is lazy. The day people on Wikipedia actually decide to pick Clean Up over Delete or Merge is the day hell freezes over, and trust me, you'll have little luck fighting it. Just do what everybody else does and mindlessly roll with consensus, and you'll have a nice time here.Dude (C) 

A few comments:
72.160.96.228, you have said at least twice that you've worked on the DB articles in the past. However, your contributions show you've only ever edited this talk page - have you previously edited under a username or a different IP address?
Many of you who disagree with the merge are complaining about """"deleted"""" material. I would like to stress that unless an entire article gets deleted, all information is still present in its history. The DVD info that people are complaining was properly sourced but got deleted anyways? Guess what, it's still there (at least, I assume that's the information you're complaining about, it's the only DVD tables I could find in any page history).
The merge can be undone if a given section gains a sufficient amount of properly sourced, nontrivial information. Because of the close relationship of the Dragon Ball manga and the DB and DBZ anime (and, to a lesser extent, DBGT), it's doubtful this will ever happen, but it's still a possibility.
You're also complaining about the amount of information that got """"lost"""" in the merge. Once again, it's not gone for good, all the information is still present in page histories, and furthermore, you've been told multiple times that you're welcome to properly source the material and add it back in as appropriate. Granted, at the moment the article is semi-protected, but you can still post reliably sourced info on the talk page to be added into the article by a registered user, or you can register for your own account and not have to wait for either the protection to expire or someone else to add the info.
KojiDude made a comment about everyone being lazy. I certainly can't speak for everyone, but I am lazy, and yet I'm still taking the time to write out this response to several complaints.

First of all the """"researcher"""" Joseph Thekedathu is known for his extreme anti-St. Thomas Christian views. He can hardly be considered a historian or researcher in the proper sense. He is a fanatic roman catholic, and all his articles(some additional websites which he maintains online) are full of hate material against the Protestants, Orthodox and Nestorian christians of India. Most of this article is based upon his """"research"""".

Also how can anyone rely on """"Vatican and Goa"""" archives to make up the history of Ahatallah? Goa is notorious as the place of the horrible catholic inquisitions in India where hundreds of saint Thomas christians, nestorian prelates, jews, muslims and hindus were burned alive at the stake. It was a former portuguese colony. There are no Saint Thomas Christians in Goa, all are Roman Catholics of the Latin rite, and Goa got independence and merged with India only in 1956, 9 years after Independence of India. Until then it was a portuguese colony.

Vatican archives or journals made in 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, midst the horrible Inquisitions cannot be considered proper hisotrical manuals to present the history of their traditional enemies- the Saint Thomas Christians of Kerala. This article is highly insulting to every Saint Thomas Christians for this reason- it is history made by its enemies and by people with an agenda to convert them.

122.172.118.114  
The second book quoted by cuchullian, ie Frykenbergs book clearly mentions that Ahatallah was a Syriac Orthodox. However Cuchullian copy pasted only the parts in stephen neills books and those quotes of Joseph Thekkedathu and presented a manipulated, concocted jesuit tale of the man Ahatallah, who is being ridiculed and mocked here as a roman catholic and agent of the Pope. His killers are presented as his masters. There is no greater way in which anyone can trample upon an indigenous community and spit upon the face of their Saint.""",0,0,0,0,0,0

Constantine founded a new city named after himself: Constantinople. Christian writers played up the idea that this was to be a 'new Rome', a fitting Christian capital for a newly Christian empire.

But they had to find ways to explain the embarrassing fact that in this new, supposedly Christian city, Constantine had erected pagan temples and statues.

Terry Semel has ran a company which has gave money to lobby groups which wish to alter the design of the internet to favor profit over ingenuity. This would effectively change the measure for which code is ranked since it would also be determined by its purchased bandwidth priority over performance. This would not only have an effect on those involved in the programming industry but change the way the internet works for the entire world. Now from Wikipedia's own article on the subject an asshole is slang described as """"The word is mainly used as a profanity towards someone the speaker does not like or whose behavior is hurtful, self-centered, or particularly abrasive."""" Now selling out the free world wide accessible library and programming performance for profit is particularly """"self-centered"""" and """"hurtful"""" behavior which influences everyone reading wikipedia.

Hello . I already posted this as part of my response on my talk page, but figured I would post it here as well. I happen to disagree with some of the information you removed from the history section of the article relating to James A. Garfield. You removed information that described the relationship between Garfield and instructors/ administrators both during and following his tenure at Hiram. I feel this was necessary in order to convey the significant role Garfield played in the early years of the institution, beyond even the time that he actually spent on campus. I have seen several correspondences written by Garfield on White House stationary, mind you, to Burke Hinsdale and other leaders of the College during his tragically brief tenure as U.S. President. Garfield's impact on the institution in its early years was so significant that there was even a movement within the College community back in the early 1900s to rename Hiram to Garfield College in his honor. This is why I feel that, if anything, the information you removed should be expanded upon, not deleted. Perhaps you were not aware of the man's impact when you removed these points.

Why are you allowing them to stay up? As for the pasted and deleted content, after my first attempt to create the page was deleted I thought there might be a format issue so I copied the entire AV Press page as a template and then REPLACED ALL OF THE TEXT ABOUT AV PRESS with the text about AV News and the website link thinking that would resolve the issue. As for my use of """"our"""", that was my outrage and having a page deleted almost as it was posted and I should have worded it better. I do not work for the AV News but I was asked to see about getting the page up by others who think people looking at wiki should be aware there are more media outlets in the area than AV Press. I am not sure what other references you need other than the bloody website. Perhaps you could can the head-up-your-ass attitude and give me an example or two of what the lord god almighty Bwilkins finds acceptable?

SO here's the question: Is wiki about getting information out or playing favorites? How much does AV Press donate for such wonderous exclusivity here? Because I simply do not see any other reasonable explanation why AV News keeps getting deleted.

I see that you have pointed out that you are an admin.  This is good.  However, your handling of my edit to Woody Allen was heavy handed and quite clumsy.  I will point out that good admins attempt to call on a different admin to assist them when they are in a conflict with a non admin, such as myself.  I now understand your point about the first sentence.  I just went out and found a reliable source for Ronan's comment in the second sentence.  Ronan's comment is notable (in hundred's of waysespecially since he is the only biological child of both Allen and Farrow).  I understand that I should not have put back in the first sentence, but on the other hand your edit was wrong.  Yes, I know you are an admin and as a good admin you want my constructive feedback to make Wikipedia work better (and I'm sure that Jimbo would agree that my feedback to you will make Wikipedia better).  You should have only removed the first sentence (because it was not supported by a RS) which is how it ultimately turned out.  However, for whatever reason you decided to remove the whole section that another edit placed in the article, including the direct comment of Ronan Farrow, Allen's only biological child.  That was heavy-handed editing.  The quote is notable.  Yes, it was initially placed in the article, by another editor, with the support of a non-RS; however, it is all over the Internet.  It is quoted by literally hundreds of RS's and you should have left in the quote in the second sentence and found a RS to replace the non-reliable source.  That would have been the correct way to handle the situation.  I hope my constructive feedback will be helpful to you in the future.  I fully expect to hear from you I'm just not sure if it is going to be positive or negative, but I do expect to hear from you.

Consensus Can Change
A small group of editors can reach a consensual decision, but when the article gains wider attention, others may then disagree. The original group should not block further change on grounds that they already have made a decision.
...
Wikipedia's decisions are ever-changing, because new people visit every day, and through new information and new ideas, we may gain insights we did not have previously. It is important that there is a way to challenge past decisions, however these decisions were reached. Decisions should therefore practically never be """"binding"""" in the sense that the decision cannot be taken back.
(Emphasis added)

Also see the flowchart at that page, particularly the first two boxes. I came across the article that was in a previous consensus, and made a change. That should not, no, can not be considered vandalism.  (talk|Contribs)

Furthermore, I'm not actually convinced consensus has been reached here, with regard to the port/spinoff/version/other-term debate. From what I can tell by going through all the comments here,  strongly believes that """"spinoff"""" is the only acceptable term;  """"isn't sure"""" but believes """"port"""" is definitely not the right term, and leans slightly toward """"other versions""""; , , and at least one unsigned comment all believe that """"spinoff"""" is not appropriate and that """"version"""" should be chosen as, while less specific, is not inaccurate by any interpretation;  supports """"spinoff"""" but feels there might be some other, better term nobody has thought of;  believes that a variety of terms should be used;  votes for """"spinoff.""""

So out of eight contributors, we have one very strong supporter of """"spinoff"""", two more moderate supporters of """"spinoff"""", three supporters of """"version"""" (and one """"slight support"""") and one supporter of """"all of the above.""""

So I have two questions,
Have I summarized everyone's position accurately?

 Regarding your edits to Ellen Pompeo and Patrick Dempsey 

I have reverted your edits to these two articles. Please review WP:V to learn about appropriate, reliable sources for the information you keep adding, and also visit WP:LIBEL and WP:BLP to learn about appropriate information in biographical articles of living people. Insinuating that these two individuals are having an affair or are anything other than faithful to their respective significant others is libelous, and against Wikipedia policy. You have not provided a reliable source to support the POV suggested by your edits. WP:NPOV will help you learn about Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy.

The quotes you have added are taken out of contexttheir mentions of a """"crush"""" on each other were done in a joking manner, and another cast member followed their comments by saying she had a crush on both of thembut that's not grounds for speculating that the cast member in question is having an affair with both of them, and if I said or insinuated that she were, that would be libel. These quotes are cast members speaking highly of each other, and frankly, good public relations by supporting their on-screen chemistry and by extension, that of the fictional characters they play. Many other cast members have complimented their co-stars, including PD and EP, but no reliable source has, to my knowledge, ever published information that these two (or any other cast members) were anything other than co-stars who happen to be friends. On the contrary, both speak frequently of their significant others in high esteem (in print and on camera), and speak well of each other's partners. There's also a question of whether such compliments are even relevant in the grand scheme of the article, but that's a moot point because your edits are unsourced, and against the WP:LIBEL policy.  If you have a reliable source for your edits, in accord with WP:Verifiability, then it's a different story, but as it is, your edits are potentially libelous and not in accord with Wikipedia editing policy.

 Comparison between articles, as far as notability judgments, are often inconsistent. This happens when small numbers of people respond, and for gray-area topics it can admittedly be very arbitrary which way the decisions go. I'd say this article has maybe a 25% chance of surviving this AfD nomination. Most current cryptocurrency articles clearly meets GNG criteria; while Wikipedia articles like Dogecoin attract ever-accumulating non-RS references that should doubtless be removed, its core is based on articles in the LA Times, the Guardian, CNN, NBC News, CoinDesk, and half a dozen other established news sites. Vertcoin has only one, the International Business Times, but surprisingly that was deemed sufficient to meet GNG. There is never really a """"final process"""" on Wikipedia, since a removed article can be reproposed when new coverage comes out, or an approved article can be renominated for deletion a while later (though it can be frowned upon if it's done frivolously). If it is deleted, I would wait for more clearly reliable-source coverage of the topic before trying again. There's really nowhere else that I think Reddcoin would be usefully mentioned in Wikipedia at this point, as it just doesn't seem noteworthy to independent sources. Auroracoin caught a lot of press because of its nationalistic hook, and Mazacoin kind of followed on its coattails, but other 2014-launched alt coins have needed to do something fundamentally different to attract much notice (e.g., Ethereum). Alt coins like Vertcoin and Reddcoin seem to offer almost no innovation, just minor adjustments to standard parameters, and have little purpose other than the creator and early adopters trying to make money off later investors. Reddcoin's """"use it to tip people on social media"""" comes several years after Bitcoin was used to tip people on social media. Maybe it will catch on due to better UI integration; time will tell, but it hasn't caught on in independent media so far. One way to try and game the system is to cause a quick price jump, which can be done a number of ways; IBT, ForexMagnates, and ForexMinute are prone to provide coverage even for some temporary price manipulation, and being idiotic news sources they treat any spikes as signs of popularity.

Fair use rationale for Image:Stone Temple Pilots.jpg

Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Stone Temple Pilots.jpg. I notice the image page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. In addition to the boilerplate fair use template, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use. Suggestions on how to do so can be found  here.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale. Using one of the templates at Wikipedia:Fair use rationale guideline is an easy way to ensure that your image is in compliance with Wikipedia policy, but remember that you must complete the template.  Do not simply insert a blank template on an image page. 

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images uploaded after 4 May, 2006, and lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion.

Sorry I never got to reply to to the message you left me on my talk page:

""""You can explain your comments all you want, but the fact remains that wikipedia policy dictates that we discuss articles, not users. Make sure you stick to that in the future. Additionally, adding the 'unsourced' tag to Iranian peoples is quite innapropriate. A simple look at the page shows at least 12 sources, not 0, as the tag implys.""""

Well what I was trying to explain is that I never make any personal statements about him (with the exception of """"to promote a positive image of Iran and Iranians"""", which, as I explained later in the same section, any person assuming good faith would take as an insult). You also might want to talk to him about accusatory statements such as this one, personally pointing me out by name. I never did anything comparable to this. Is this in accordance with your policy of """"we discuss articles, not users""""???? 

As for the unsourced tag, it's been discussed in the talk page. The article does not provide any sources discussing the subject of the article. All the sources provided are about other ethnic groups, but they make side comments that have been taken out context and are contradictory to some of the other statements appearing on the page. The article is on Iranian peoples, so it should contain at least one source discussing who these people are. Such a source has yet to be provided. 

I think the article was initially meant to be written on the linguistic group of all speakers of Iranian languages, but the definition has changed considerably due to some misunderstandings (Iran is also the name of a country and some Iranian citizens see themselves as part of a greater ethnic group, that of """"Iranian peoples"""" - see the article on Greater Iran for signs of this). I'm not sure what's the best way to move on from here. The article definitely has to be rewritten with a clear definition in mind, but a lot of users are not being cooperative. I'd consider any advice or mediation. Thanks, Talk

Strong Oppose - While Autism and Asperger's are known to be related spectrum disorders, there are very distinct symptoms involved.  If DSM V does change it's perspective on this in three years time, then we can revisit this - but it's certainly not the job of Wikipedia to pre-judge that. Quite the opposite, in fact.  The current DSM IV is the authoritative document - an unfinished draft of a possible future edition is most certainly not.  There is no urgency here - we don't have to jump at the smallest news item - we're here to take the longer, more considered route - and that means revisiting this when DSM V is actually published, and not a day earlier.

Is this a 2nd version from 1993? My copy of BATB has that trailer.""""

 Character bios 

It is of my opinion that the short character bios preceeding the main characters' character descriptions are more than trivial information than what we really need to have in the article. Also, it's not usually standard to give this type of information in characters sections on Wikipedia (I've seen at least), so I am going to go ahead and delete them.  (|talk) 

I have just added the Zuka Club to the 'supporting characters' section; I thought they were at least as deserving of being mentioned as Nekozawa and Renge. I'm not so good with adding pictures - especially when I have none - or Japanese kanji. Is there anyone who can add these?  

Well, I added the clubs section and a pic for each club, and I'll get to the kanji for Zuka next.  (|talk) 

 Cool. Nice choice of pictures.  

I've added a brief piece on Kotoko Fujioka to the 'supporting characters' section. Do you guys think it's too much ...? And if not, could someone add the kanji and a picture?

I added her picture, but I don't know where to find the kanji for Kotoko.  (|talk) 

They should be visible in the fansub of episode 19; there's a scene of Ranka and Kotoko (Haruhi inside) when Ranka is having a flashback. I can't read kanji myself, but the translation for the caption text said that's what it says.

 Japanese Title 
While glancing through the edit history, I found it interesting that a revert had been done with a comment that the previous user should learn to read katakana before making edits on the Japanese part of the pages.  Not being the user in question who made the first change that got reverted, I can only speculate on how much they actually knew, but the change made (and then reverted) wasn't involved with katakana at all, as it was regarding the 部 in 桜蘭高校ホスト部, which is kanji.

Now, I'm not all that fluent in the language, but I've seen no record of 部 being *directly* romanized into kurabu.  I have heard the characters use both hosuto-bu (ホスト部) and hosuto kurabu (ホストクラブ) at different times fairly interchangably, but the title of the anime itself uses the kanji.  Is there a translation for the kanji that directly romanizes into kurabu that I'm not aware of?  

I've since figured out that the reason for this difference is due to the furigana used in both the anime and manga's titles, hence the confusion - the loanword kurabu isn't normally a given reading for the kanji.  However, in the two episodes of the anime where ホスト部 is directly referenced in the episode title, Haruhi uses bu instead of kurabu when reading it aloud, so there is still a difference there.  What would be the suggested method to approach this, given the vocal reading of it in the anime versus the usage of kurabu in the romanization of 部 in all Ouran-related pages, including the Episode title list?  

I'll be glad to clear this up for you. If you look at the image of the title of the anime given here, we see that above the kanji and to the left are a series of katakana characters. The last 3 of which spell out ku-ra-bu, hence why I stated the anon user learn to read katakana before editing the title again.  (|talk) 

Yes, the furigana, as I noted later.  The anon user seemed either familiar with kanji itself though or used one of the translations that was based on only the kanji - without the furigana as a guide, 'bu' would be the",0,0,0,0,0,0

You are incorrect. Please read the subsection EMI and the Grundy Incident. After the discussion of the Today show encounter with host Bill Grundy and its effect on the band's reputation, the subsection concludes with this paragraph:
Following the end of the tour in late December, three concerts were arranged in Holland for January 1977. The band, hungover, boarded a plane at London Heathrow Airport early on 4 January; a few hours later, the Evening News was reporting that the band had """"vomited and spat their way"""" to the flight. Despite categorical denials by the EMI representative who accompanied the group, the label, which was under political pressure, released the band from their contract. As McLaren fielded offers from other labels, the band went into the studio for a round of recordings with Goodman, their last with both him and Matlock.

f2b695aaeda9cc0a,"Deletion of Malenovski and Kiev school district citations 

Given that this is a contested article, I wanted to explain my reasoning in recent changes.  Firstly,  I inserted exact statistical per centages for the # of schools teaching in Ukrainian.  I did this b/c using partly to characterize 48% and overwhelmingly to characterize 70% is really pushing it.  48% is almost 1/2 and 70 is about 3/4.  Partly sounds like 1/5-2/5 and overwhelmingly is somewhere between 85%-99% broadly understood.

Now about the Kiev's school district footnote.  In my opinion, whereas the information is true, it is too narrow for our purposes here.  Citing national or at least regional statistics seems more appropriate.  As for Malenovski's article, the issue was unverifiability of the statistics.  I read through the article and came to the section where Malenovski cites the numbers (towards the end).  They are there, but no original source is named, no link is given for verification of the numbers.  Finally, I hope that wikipedia editors contributing to Ukrainization will continue to insist on the level of scholarship expected and enforced for sources/articles dealing with the Holodomor article.  Citing Malenovski and going to the lengths of translating his pov (in this case) is rather unacceptable.

By the way, I certainly prefer Gogol in Russian than in translation to English, Polish or Ukrainian.  How can you not love?:

 Motto of the day 

Hello, I notice you're using one of the  templates, run by Wikipedia:Motto of the day. You may have noticed that some of the mottos recently have been followed by a date from 2006, or on occasion simply """"Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"""". The reason for this is that Motto of the day is in some very serious need of help. Participation in the project, which has never been especially high, has dropped considerably over this past summer, to the point we have had several days where no motto was scheduled to appear at all. Over the past several weeks, I've been the only editor scheduling mottos at all, but there aren't enough comments on some of these mottos to justify their use. If we do not get some help - and soon - your daily mottos will stop. In order for us to continue updating these templates for you, we need your help.

When you get a chance between your normal editing, could you stop by our nominations page and leave a few comments on some of the mottos there, especially those that do not have any comments yet? This works very simply; you read a motto, decide whether or not you like it, and post your opinion just below the motto. That's it - no experience required, just an idea of what you personally like and what you feel reflects Wikipedia and its community. If you do have past experience with the project, then please close some of the older nominations once they've got a decent consensus going. There are directions on the nominations page on how to do this.

If you have any questions, please let me know, or post on the project's talk page. I'm looking forward to reading your comments on the suggested mottos, and any additional suggestions you'd like to make. Until then, happy editing!  (//c) """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Cette étude porte sur l’actualisation de la stature moyenne en Europe. Contrairement aux idées reçues, il apparaît, selon notre
enquête réalisée sur 2705 garçons et 2842 filles âgés de 17 ans, que les adolescents des Alpes Dinariques sont, en moyenne,
les plus grands d’Europe. Avec une stature moyenne de 185,6 cm, ils se situent devant les Néerlandais, qui mesurent 184 cm.
C’est surtout la densité de sujets de très grande taille qui confère à la région des Alpes Dinariques sa caractéristique, avec 28%
de sujets de plus de 190 cm, alors que les Néerlandais n’en comptent que 20% et la France 1,5%. Chez les filles, bien que l’on
ne dispose pas de beaucoup d’informations, les adolescentes dinariques, avec une stature moyenne de 171 cm, se situent juste
derrière les Néerlandaises. Pour citer cet article  J.-C. Pineau et al., C. R. Biologies 328 (2005).

Abstract
Average height of adolescents in the Dinaric Alps. This study contributes to an update of average heights among European
populations. Our investigation covering 2705 boys and 2842 girls aged 17 years, shows that, contrary to the general belief,
adolescents of the Dinaric Alps are, on average, the tallest in Europe. With an average height of 185,6 cm, they are taller than
Dutch adolescents (184 cm on average). Above all, the density of very tall subjects appears to be characteristic of the Dinaric
Alps, since 28% measure 190 cm or more in height, as opposed to only 20% in Holland and 1.5% in France. Although our
information is not complete, adolescent girls in the Dinaric Alps, with an average height of 171 cm come a close second to girls
in Holland. To cite this article: J.-C. Pineau et al., C. R. Biologies 328 (2005).

Abridged English version
The diachronic increase in the stature of European
peoples has always been of interest to anthropologists.
Since the 1960s and until now, Scandinavians of both
sexes had been the tallest Europeans, followed, in descending
order, by the Dutch, Danes, Norwegians and
Swedes.
With the recent enlargement of the European Community,
it has become necessary to establish which
European country has the tallest adolescents on average.
In 1968, Montenegrin teenagers, with an average
height of 176.9 cm, had already been found to be the
tallest, followed by Norwegians at 173.6 cm. Since
then, there has been a significant increase in average
heights in all European countries, especially Holland,
where the average height among adolescents increased
the fastest (8 cm in 40 years), to reach 184 cm in
2000. However, given the lack of recent data on average
heights among inhabitants of the Dinaric Alps, we
carried out a study to update the information available.
The study was conducted among 17 year-olds (2705
boys and 2844 girls) in schools in various towns in
Herzegovina and central Dalmatia. Boys, unlike girls,
are still growing in height at 17 years of age. Different
longitudinal studies have shown that boys, on
average, grow by at least one centimetre between the
ages of 17 and 20. We have therefore added one centimetre
to all average heights for boys. As in other
European countries, height is influenced by the social
environment: in our study, lycée pupils were found to
be 2–3 cm taller on average than pupils in vocational
schools. Taking these variations into account as well
as observed differences between coastal and inland
communities, we found that",0,0,0,0,0,0

Fair use rationale for Image:Hd-mch.jpg
Thanks for uploading or contributing to Image:Hd-mch.jpg.

The problem being, my friend, that you are not a specialist in that field, and have been posting for over a month in YBM's private forums, and are a very big fan and socket puppet of his.
The second problem being that your extensiv scientifical """"evidencies"""", well supplied above, contain absolutly nothing who don't have been mentioned, and I should say """"supposed"""", earlier, already at the beginning of 2004, and abundently refutated since, and that all those counterproofs dismantled all the attacks from the scientifical part of the accusators, and that it was then agreed that it was more a question of specialisation differences than of direct misunderstanding of existing theories, or gross ignorancies of basic physic.
Thats what make Cosmology a specific part of advance physic.
Your field being not Cosmology nor Higher physic nor Theoretical Physic, it will have been better if you had first consulted with a """"collegue"""" from the department of Theoretic Physic, before you posted here, or even before you made up your opinion about the Bogdanovs work.
You made already plenty of that kind of mistakes also in the french wiki about this case, and no, we are not impress at your ability to repeat yourself and others statements without correction alredy brought by other scientifics.

Notability of Buffalo Zero
A tag has been placed on Buffalo Zero requesting that it be speedily deleted from Wikipedia. This has been done because the article appears to be about a person, group of people, band, club, company, or web content, but it does not indicate how or why the subject is notable: that is, why an article about that subject should be included in an encyclopedia. Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay. Please do not remove the speedy deletion tag yourself, but don't hesitate to add information to the article that would confirm the subject's notability under Wikipedia guidelines.

For guidelines on specific types of articles, you may want to check out our criteria for biographies, for web sites, for bands, or for companies. Feel free to leave a note on my talk page if you have any questions about this.  69.123.113.89  """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I've just skimmed this drivel  I really don't have much time for it  and noticed comments by CLIFTONIAN. I need to apologize to this man. 

I got out of Pattani towards the end of Ramadam and spent a few days in Singapore. Ramadam this year in Pattani was tough (Google """"Pattani Bomb"""" to see what I mean, and perhaps look at the IMAGES, too). I got back to Pattani on Friday (the start of HARI RAYA) and had a few drinks. We all did. This was when I wrote my final comments. 

Yep  what I did was wrong. I had no right to disrupt CLIFTONIAN's review. Being slightly drunk is not an excuse. I've checked the guy's profile page and would like to say that I have immense respect for the Israeli armed forces.

Additional suggestions for Pigeon Force PD: Who's the chief? Any major history? Big crime solved? Any controversy or major lawsuit against it? When was it established? Was the area patrolled by the county sheriff before then and then the city was established (if so when?).  These are just tips.  Otherwise, there is a risk that someone will petition for the article's deletion because there is a board for that (thus destroying your hard work).

Where we very often see big controversies, though, is with editors who are disruptive while trying to help. This is where we sometimes see a harmful side effect of our (generally quite useful) notion of assuming good faith. Many editors have focused so much on this that they have come to believe that good faith is all that is required to be a useful contributor. Sadly, this is not the case at all. Competence is required as well. 
Competence is required.  Yet, what can we do when we suspect that competence is lacking?  That entry does not provide any step by step process for allowing us to express our concerns regarding editors who are editing outside their areas of expertise.  So Wikipedia policy clearly states that competence is required...but it doesn't give us anything to do about it.  

When we suspect that an entry has a problem...what do we do about it?  Well...either we fix it or we tag the page so that other people can hopefully fix the problem.  Clearly I believe these two editors have a problem...but what could I do to fix it?  Obviously I spent a lot of time trying to encourage them to look at the reliable sources.  That didn't work...so all I could think to do was """"tag"""" them with an accurate label so that other editors might be alerted to the problem.  

Are there better ways of dealing with problems of incompetence?  There are always better ways to deal with problems.  But so far no other editors have brought any other ways to my attention.

I considered your explanation and looked at the article (left it, looked again, left it, ...) and I have come to the conclusion that the certs listing as you've changed them just look too much like a random order. The alpha-by-provider is neater, in my view, than the provider-in-order-of-country-where-we-have-one. Maybe your way would look better if we always had 10 charts and 10 certs, and they'd sort of match up. Not sure.
In any case, if you feel strongly about your preference on Katy Perry discography, I'd guess you'll want that system on every article, yes? In that case (especially), it would be great if you would (re-)start a discussion of the sorting of the certs over at WT:DISCOGSTYLE. There, you'd have a chance of building consensus one way or the other (it was most recently for alpha-by -provider, but concensus can change, and it's a smallish group there).

 coppermine-T 

Hi Denniss, i'm the guy who submitted the edit for the coppermine-T that you reverted.  I can't guarantee ALL BX boards support coppermine-Ts, but there's no question at least the Abit BX-133 RAID does, so it's not accurate to say they are old-core-new-board only as is the impression in the current state.  Their last released BIOS notes explicitly list support for 1GHz Celerons which are definitely Coppermine-Ts: 

http://www.abit.com.tw/page/sa/download/download_bios_detail.php?pFILE_TYPE=Bios&pMAIN;_TYPE=Motherboard&pTITLE;_ON_SCREEN=BX133-RAID&pSOCKET;_TYPE=Socket%20370

Also, on this forum there's an excerpt from someone who's had communication from Abit re: coppermine-T support (you have to scroll down, no direct link): 

http://www.abxzone.com/forums/archive/index.php/t-6817.html

i'm pasting it here:

I think the PIII 1200mhz you guys are seeing is not a Tualatin but a faster PIII called the CopperMine-T.

Check this thread at anandtech:

Link (http://forums.anandtech.com/messageview.cfm?catid=28&threadid;=512647) 

There is a post from RichieZZZZ there and he posted:

you need to read HOCP they e-mailed abit about it.

<< There is and has been confusion about what exactly Tualatin CPUs will work in as we stated earlier. It seems as if Tualatin CPUs are not backwards compatible with BX or i815 chipsets. When I posted this earlier I got this mail from Don Goff that pointed us to this link which we had posted a month or so ago that states this, """"Supports Intel Coppermine T CPU."""" about their BIOS upgrade for the ABIT BX133 RAID board. Admittedly I am a bit confused about this too so we asked ABIT what exactly the deal is and here is their response. 

Kyle,

OK, I have it. It is the confusion about CopperMine CPU vs. CopperMine-T CPU vs. Tualatin CPU.

The CopperMine-T was the CPU that was the bridge between the CopperMine and Tualatin platforms. The CopperMine-T can work in BX boards, usually through a BIOS update. 

The Tualatin CPU has a different pinout and simply will not work in a BX board. I have confirmed this with our R&D; and FAE so have to believe that this time it is true.

Mr. Swordfish, you wrote """"it would be absurd say it was the other way around, i.e. to insist that you are making the bus speed up by pressing on the back of your seat.""""

Did you mean to say, """"it would be absurd say it was the other way around, i.e. to insist that you are creating a force on your back by accelerating."""" ?

I think so.  You were making the (good) point that simply reversing F and a in the cause and effect statement seems intuitively absurd in this case.  But the F in statement 1 is the forward force exerted on the back, not the backward force by the back, and the a is the acceleration of the person, not of the bus.

If we make the reversal one of switching equal and opposite forces carefully, we come up with """"The backward force of the back on the bus causes the acceleration of the bus to be lower than it otherwise would be"""" which is different than the way you wrote it.  In this case there is no intuitive absurdity at all.  Both cause and effect statements are equally intuitive.

Crowsfoot is right that F=ma, or its fluid dynamics equivalent, doesn't by itself indicate an asymmetric cause and effect relationship.  If causes must precede effects, then we could even argue that F=ma forbids a either causal interpretation, since it refers to instantaneous values of both F and a (and m).  

But its helpful to the reader, I think, to go with the intuitively appealing bias that net forces (pressure differences) cause accelerations (of bodies or particles, or for us, of differential volumes of fluid).  The real difficulty comes when the reader wants to know if the pressure field is caused by the flow field, or vice versa.  We must get him/r to abandon this truly meaningless question, I believe, and understand that Newton's differential equation, and the continuity and mass conservation constraints all have to hold at the same time.  The infinite set of 3d velocity vectors and the infinite set of local pressures have to be consistent with each other, and there is no intuitively meaningful way to say that one causes the other.

 Recent edits by dapi 

User dapi did several edits which look for me kinda strange or even bias

the infobox

some weeks ago i created the infobox with good reliable data, mostly zetterling koltunov frieser. i created notes so that everyone can check
fast which units had how much men/tanks. this numbers were near perfect now dapi changed into the numbers of glantz, who seems to be a bit dubios
. glantz was earlier convicted for using russian extrem propaganda like rotmistrov, his books cited rotmistrov and used faked sources.

what was changed? the infbox now has lower numbers for men, this is explained fast and easy. The menpower before was the so called Verpflegungsstärke
, iam missing the english word but this means the strengh was every listed personnel in this units so auxillary units were included. i decided to take
this number becuse most articles use this number. but the russian number dropped by 900.000. this is explained easily too. glantz/dapi ( i dont know if glantz
really uses this number ) didnt count the entire steppe front ^^ i explain this """"trick"""" with tanks:

the tanks: we can see perfectly on the tanks. before dapis edit, the infbox showed 4.900 russian AFV but now only 3,155. i looked my sources and find
1,607 tanks for the central  1,699 voronez that makes 3,306( this is glantz numbers plus some tanks), this number is already higher than glantz """"numbers"""" but now it comes, he totally forgot 
the steppefront
with 1,632 tanks, the same steppefront which used many of his armies to support the southern wing. to exclude the steppefront is nothing less than russian bias and vandalizm
. during operaiton zitadelle the westernfront and the brijansk front started attacking the german units both fronts together fielded another 3,200 tanks lol . but this
troops are no included. i dit not include this troops too because i was aware that this will be reverted but to be honest all participating russian fronts fielded
~8,000 tanks ^^( to compare please take zetterling who wrote a book about the numbers of kursk ) but glantz achieve a much lesser number with excluding entire fronts. alone rotmistrovs 
5th Guards Tank Army fielded 800 tanks and attacked mansteins tropps^^.
so the russian numbers are simply selective, if a front took part or dont doesnt madder... .but why are the german tanks so high now?

while glantz is excluding entire russian fronts he brings a strange number for german tanks, when i check the sources i found 3,534 tanks ( zetterling/frankson wrote a book only about 
the numbers behind kursk, frieser and the german ministry for militarystudy support with primary data) for the eastern front. glantz brings 3,155 tanks . lol . i dont know were this numbers 
came from but this would mean that the 3 german armies had 90% of all tanks in this 3 armies ( one is only armygroup ).
this is bullshit we have a list for all german units and tanks, glantz number is wrong. the joke is while he excludes the entire steppe front brijansk and westernfront he dont excludes all
the german reserves which werent used like the tankcorps around the 5th SS wiking this units werent used. but the used russian units are excluded . heavy bias.... . i can support my points with
sources . i would suggest dapi does the same and we discuss the book of glantz. please tell me what glantz says why he excludes the other fronts.... . to avoid such bias i created notes so that every
reader can click and see immediate which army/front had how much tanks, that was good i think....

dapi comments his changes with """"removing unreliable ed"""" []
he calls frieser ( and the Militärgeschichtliche Forschungsamt Deutschland and his 5 co-autors ) zetterling/frankson ( they made a book only about the numbers of kursk ) and koltunov unreliable even
krivosheev becomes """"dubios"""" for user dapi [].
while he uses glantz who was punked by blatant propaganda[] and seems to fake numbers to support his fact
that red army didnt need numerical superiority. a interesting example is that dapi uses glantz to cite 350 tank losses for prokhorovka ( the mythbattle) and the same book is used to cite 340 losses
for the complete """"zitadellecampaign"""" -) . here it must be noted that user dapi89 is a big fan of frieser, he is citing him always when talks about blitzkrieg and to revert edits on the blitzkrieg-
page. so his opinions is not straight...

Boy, this is the most understated thing I've read here on Wikipedia.  While the current details about ZCMI are pretty good, and the list of stores when the chain wwas closed down is pretty accurate, it is hardly an exaustive list of stores that have been in existance.  Virtually every Mormon community had a version of ZCMI at one time or another, and some decidedly non-Mormon communities as well.  The most remarkable being a ZCMI set up in Rapid City, South Dakota.

In addition, a huge part of the history of ZCMI is tied directly with the history of Utah, including the petition for Utah statehood and the fight between the """"Mormons"""" and the """"Gentiles"""" during the territorial days of Utah.  Part of this history should include how members of the LDS Church would face excommunication if they shopped anywhere except at ZCMI.  I am not kidding here.  Several LDS Church members were removed from the church rolls because of this seemingly irrational justification (based on modern sentiments).  Keep in mind that there was a coordinated economic plan to try and push the non-Mormons out of Mormon influenced areas, and this is really in keeping with other business traditions of 19th Century America as well, including Standard Oil and others that would be illegal with current fair trade laws.

Saying that the LDS Church was a significant influences is hardly doing justice here.  The LDS Church owned the store lock, stock, and barrel.  And the decision to sell ZCMI to May department stores was mainly a way for the LDS Church to get out of that sort of business.  What is surprising is that is was a subsiderary of the LDS Church for so long, making it into the 21st Century.  The LDS Church has divested itself from other businesses it started back elsewhen like a Sugar Company and a chain of Hospitals, and in that context ZCMI is just one of several aspects of life in Utah.

Male graduates before 1969 
I've added mention to the 'trivia' section regarding men who matriculated at vassar immediately after world war II on the GI bill. I suppose this could be classified as 'original research', not sure. My father was in that first graduating class that included men (eleven of them). A scan of the relevant portion of the program from the graduation ceremonies can be found here . again, if this constitutes original research, i guess it can be pulled, though it is a rather fascinating bit of history.  

 Bias 

There are many abundantly clear examples of bias in this article: “Vassar is often praised for its beautiful campus, a 1000 acre (4 km?) lot of land marked by period and modern buildings that is also an arboretum; since that time, it has maintained its reputation as one of America's outstanding liberal arts colleges, and is especially noted for its tolerant social atmosphere; the college is a member of the """"Little Ivies,"""" an unaffiliated group of elite northeastern liberal arts colleges; Vassar is a leader in producing doctoral candidates; Vassar students are well known for their individuality, creativity, and open-mindedness; many beautiful old brick buildings are scattered throughout the bucolic campus, but there are also several modern and contemporary structures worth noting.""""  Did this come straight from the College’s website?   

 Bias ? 

I disagree with the above allegation of bias in the article.  I found no similarity between the Vassar Web site and the article.  The information in question - the attractiveness of the campus - seems fairly innocuous and is fairly similar to the type of information in Wikipedia articles about other liberal arts colleges and several universities.  The article reads like synopsis of commercially available background information in colleges guide books.  While I would have written the main paragraph differently, I hardly think this qualifies as biased, and without some criteria to differentiate this page from other pages on other schools, I believe the objection should be removed from this page.

The article violates Wikipedia's NPOV policy, clearly.  Wikipedia is an encyclopedia, a place to find innformation, not a forum for opinions.  If you are unwilling to make changes, then I will go ahead and make them myself.  Also, you should leave you name when commenting.   

Also, I realize that the article is not up to date and violates Wikipedia's policy against personal research (ie, students spend time doing ceratin activities on a certain lawn).   

I do agree that much of the information on this page is somewhat biased. And the architectural info came from me, not the college's website - so, my apologies for lack of """"neutrality"""" there. However, if you edit the page to remove said """"bias"""", please re-read your edits before saving the page. Simply removing phrases and not doing a little copyedit makes the page read poorly. I have made some minor edits just so that it reads a little cleaner, hopefully not restoring anything that you feel is biased. I think the bigger issue is that this page has become a series of lists (academic majors, famous alums, residence halls) with little encyclopedic content and is an embarrasment compared to other articles about comparable schools.

 AFD and Userfication 

Hi Rohedin, I've volunteered to be your go-to for this! The article should shortly appear in your userspace. Obviously (given the AfD) there are concerns about the notability of the article's subject. You (or anyone interested in the article) need to address those issues. I can help you with that, but that doesn't mean the article's subject is - at the moment - notable. It may be that you simply need to wait until the subject becomes more widely known, or that you find another subject to write about.

Either way, I'm here to help.

A blastocyst is a stage of development of an embryo when it is around five days old and made up of about 100 cells.

At this point in my life I've gone back to school specifically to get a degree in philosophy and no longer even work as a scientist, so for you to cast aspersions of scientism is wholly unfounded. 

I don't think Dawkins should be called a philosopher for two reasons: 1. He is not referred to as such in philosophical publications, at least not enough that it is justifiable to call him a philosopher outright per WP:V, and 2. He does not work within the traditions of any established academic disciplines of philosophy.  That is, he does not attempt to deconstruct language so as to understand and analyze its meaning and to subsequently determine - through rigorous logic - the truth or falsity of propositions, as he would if he practiced analytical philosophy.  Nor does he fit into the traditions - however broad - of continental philosophy.  Granted, he does write about subjects that are within the pursue of philosophy, but he does not do so in a philosophical style.  Now, I'll fully admit that the there is a sort of Demarcation problem here, and so my second point should only be considered an aside to the first point.

I don't object to your content edit, but you blew away the citation referencing I did on the existing source. That's lazy editing. I spent a great number of hours formatting over 100 citations on that article so that it would have nice complete footnotes, and I don't appreciate having the sweat of my labor turned into an inline URL that might go dead in a month. Please take more care in the future. -  

Lazy editing is removing factual information which you could have sourced in 3 seconds work. I'd say content is considerably more important than formatting a citation prettily. Derex 
 Excuse me, but I spent five minutes formatting that source, including verifying what was in the article. My edit was proper. It brought the claim in line with the source provided. Your edit removed a valid citation, and replaced it with a simple inline link, which works against the interest of the project. A cite is still valid with a dead link, if the publishing info is there. But when an inline link goes dead without that information, it is much more difficult to find again. I know, because I had to chase down about a third of the citations in that article over the past couple of weeks. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the work of others, and be a little more careful next time. -  

Excuse me, but I spent 3 seconds finding a source for that, including reading the google synopsis of the very top hit. Please don't remove trivially sourced content from Wikipedia, which works against the interest of the project. My edit removed neither facts nor citations. Pretty formatting is all very nice, but this is an encylopedia. There is nothing at all wrong with adding inline links, as I did, particularly when they support the facts in an article. My edit was proper. So don't get snarky with me. Just have a little respect for the factual content added by others, and be a little more careful next time. - Derex 
 Not one of my edits removed the source that the anon editor provided. WP:ATT requires that the editor inserting the claim source it properly. The claim did not match the source, so I simply adjusted it during the primary act of adding actual citation information to to URL. According to WP:ATT, it is not my responsibility to further source every claim that an anon adds to an article. It is my responsibility, according to an agreement made on the talk page, to properly cite all the sources that were in the article, so that they may be further verified. A proper citation, with author, title, publisher, and date, is always preferable (even with NO url) to a simple URL. If some high school kid is researching at the library, and he finds a good citation, he can look that article up on microfiche, but if all that is there is a dead link, he's screwed. Now you can keep deluding yourself that you are right and I am wrong, but no one is going to buy that line of bullshit.

Sorry, your code is even unclearer than that in the article. Where did you pull the 18 from, for example? Non-experts of Python won't know that the return format of bin(a) will have a 0b prefix. Note that Python is used here as pseudocode, so it's better to avoid assuming much knowledge of the Python standard library.   

The Python code in the article suffers from two problems:
1) It's unclear what kind of value each variable holds. The variables should either be renamed to something self-descriptive, or a comment should explain the role of each.
2) The code is slightly obscure because it tries to be smart about not recomputing an index expression. Now to explain the algorithm, we don't need optimized code (and an optimizing compiler, which we'd use if efficiency is of any concern, would spot this anyway, so there isn't any reason to even slightly complicate the code even in production).

The code from the ACM Sian article by Chan is much clearer; here's transcribed and commented pseudocode:

def z_order(p, q, d):
    """"Returns true if p < q according to Z-order in d dimensions.
    p and q are supposed to be arrays of d coordinates.""""
    i = 0 # index of most significant dimension
    for j in range(1, d):
        # Use ^ (exclusive or) to eliminate equal bits.
        # msb_is_less will see ones where the coordinates differ.
        if msb_is_less (p[i]^q[i], p[j]^q[j]):
            i = j
    return p[i] < q[i]

def msb_is_less(l, r):
    """"Returns true if the Most Significant Bit of l is less than that of r.""""
    return l <= r or l < l^r # Described as """"neat trick"""" by Chan

Note that the algorithm in the article has """"l < r"""" instead of """"l <= r""""; this changes the result of msb_is_less but I suspect it does not change the result of z_order.

18ce4727ae3e07b8,"A sound new policy?

An island cannot be a nation/culture/state in itself, nor inherently owned by anyone. I'm afraid it is simply fascistic to claim land in this way - let alone abuse powers to enforce it. When another nation covers part of the island (in this case the United Kingdom), it makes it doubly wrong. Wikipedia needs a clear policy to stop nations from claiming a land article, especially when they already have an official article. One each, you greedy scoundrels - one each. If you are really into 'history', organise it like everyone else: Historical 'era' articles simply must be subsets of the official nation article. 

I cannot stress this enough: Wikipedia should NEVER assert that any nation is a land, however long a nation has been associated with it. Read the papers - read about Europe. Read about the blood shed - read about the world. We simply cannot let this be done. But has anyone got the guts to address 'policy', I wonder?

Wikipedia uber alles? I don't think so. Wikimedia ironically owns nothing but its ventures, and this inherently right-wing 'anarchy Wikipedia' is destined to ultimately fall. If it has sense (and value), it will adapt and change instead.
 
I'd be obliged if people leave my talk page in peace now. I'm switching off my email too - it was only open for another issue.   

PS (last one). Of course the word 'country' can mean 'countryside' in an emotive sense - but that cannot be a definition regarding groups of people on Wikipedia. The Wikipedia 'top list' should be List of countries: Sovereign states/Nations/Tribes. Country should always be used as the disambiguator. No-one gets pushed out of the whole structure then (as they do now), and they are all admitted to be 'country'-connected in some way - but is doesn't include any land masses! Footnotes can be made for cases if needed - it simply won't be messier than it is now, far from it. 

People need to take up the mantle on all of this. There are many people on Wikipedia trying to engineer the 'identity mess' on Wikipedia to support their nationalistic views. At its most negative, this is often a 'comparative' matter for them - so they often go after other cases/causes more than directly push their own. The two Irelands and the very specific 'constituent countries' of the United Kingdom are always on their radar, and this crazy disruption over the Irelands now has made them stronger, without doubt. A quick glance at my 700 page watchlist confims that. Logical consistency leads to stability, anarchy like we have now leads to disruption",0,0,0,0,0,0
52b530626f692c97,"""

I understand what the confusion is about. But for clarity, let's clear this out: These are the contentious edits and their summaries:

 """"That feels like WP:WEASEL""""

 """"Inferred by TBA status""""

 """"To me, this says """"they're on the entry list, but we don't really believe it will happen""""

 """"Same as before""""

Crucially you only went to the talk page after making these edits. These edits were then followed 4 hours and 24 minutes later by three edits to correctly format the footnotes after you were again reverted by User:Twirlypen 2 hours 28 minutes later

 """"If this is going to be done, it should be done like this (need to make two more edits before changes are fully visible""""

Now I have two questions:

1) Can you understand why contributors could consider those first four edits as edit-warring, especially considering those summaries.

2) Why did you not indicate in your edit summary for the last two edits of that contentious set of four that you were reformatting them and thus making consistent with community opinion if that was your goal and why did you remove the content entirely in the first place if you only wanted to reformat?

I still don't think you actually broke WP:3RR because the policy clearly states a series of continuous, uninterrupted edits can be considered to be one revert. I can understand though that this is deemed to be a minor edit war.   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

 Rotten Tomatoes 

WP:MOSFILM and WP:RTMC have several things to say about Rotten Tomatoes. 
Rotten Tomatoes started roughly in 2000, for films before then the score from Rotten Tomatoes is often deemphasized and put at the end of the critical response section, as it is done in the case of this article. 

Weasel words like """"mostly"""" should be avoided, when the wording can be specific and the wording should be improved to avoid this. 
If you look at the reviews for Goldfinger you will see they are all dated post 2000, this can be specifically stated and vague weasel words avoided. 

An editor stated that the percentage given by Rotten Tomatoes is not the """"score"""" and that the score was """"8.4"""" but this was clearly an incorrect description, Rotten Tomatoes describes 8.4 as the """"rating average"""". It would probably be good to include the 8.4 rating average, if editors feel the Rotten Tomatoes percentage is somehow """"dishonest"""".

d972aa4debec021b,"""Hi Paul

Given your previous edits of this article I'm wary of your neutrality here, but here's what I think about this

The 'controversy' section actually has several subsections.   Only the Jones section isn't broken into its own subsection  I guess you don't want to modify those for now.  I looked into the history and at one point it was called """"a controversial person"""" and was much different than its current incarnation.

The Jones subsection is overly long, but I would imagine this particular paragraph has gone through so many iterations that we can't deduce the original intention without looking at older editions.   For instance, the part about Paula buying a house and accruing a tax bill could have evolved beginning with a quote from Coulter calling Jones (her supposed ally) trailer trash.   From there someone may have objected to the quote, so someone else explained its context by saying Jones posed nude.   Then someone didn't want to look POV with regard to Jones so explained her behavior because of a huge tax bill, then someone explained that as a result of buying a house, etc etc.   Most actions in a persons life can be explained, partially, by circumstances out of their control, so explanations like this can go on for eternity.

The references to """"Oh Paula"""" probably developed similarly, with someone demanding citations.   If an evolutionary chipping away of coherency this did occur,  it isn't reasonable to wipe the section altogether.   I saw another reference on the talk page to the Vietnam section being originally quite short but gaining a life of its own as its context was wiped and arguments about it transformed it into something which probably has more weight than it deserves.

I'm sure LimpDaddy would object to this being objective, but the way I see it, the important parts of the Paula Jones section are
- Coulter wanting to """"bring down the president"""", no matter the best interests of her client/advisee 
- Coulter, a supposedly great lawyer, advising Jones to go forward on a case that was ultimately dismissed
- Coulter using Paula Jones then washing her hands of her once the dust settled (calling her """"trailer trash"""")

Additionally, the motives of the various authors are at odds, but reading it, the picture that emerges is of a very two-faced individual.  I'm sure some would say Coulter just learned the truth about Jones upon which she changed her tune, but that doesn't give Coulter nearly enough credit.

Though it doesn't matter for this section, you might see that the """"trailer-park trash"""" comment.   It is not satire or sarcasm to achieve comic effect, it is an honest to goodness insult.

One of the issues that keeps getting brought up is the lack of evidence on the First Vision.

Let me counter this with a short quote from the Preface to Robert Remini's biography on Joseph Smith:
""""I should make it clear at the outset that I am not a Mormon. As such I faced several problems in writing this book, one of which involved Joseph's visions and revelations, which are crucial to an understanding of him, his Church, and the times in which he lived. After considerable thought I decided to present his religious experiences just as he described them in his writings and let readers decide for themselves to what extent they would give credence to them. I am not out to prove or disprove any of his claims. As a historian I have tried to be as objective as possible in narrating his life and work."""" (Remini p. x)
In his book, Remini presents the First Vision as Smith said it happened, the same as other biographers do, and the same way I believe we should do. Like Remini, we should not be trying to prove or disprove any of Smith's claims, but unlike Remini, or job is fairly simple. We don't have to worry about what was historical and what was not. We don't need to do original research. Our job is to reflect reliable sources. ~

Aspergers is a particularly interesting situation, because some of the characteristics of the syndrome could mimic the symptoms of COI editing (i.e. an abnormally intense focus on the Asperger article). It could be quite a tricky situation to deal with, actually. et """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Oxonian2006, my tone may sound a bit out of control but I'm not. Issues like this one are very important to me due to my own family history. Now, going further into your comment...unfortunately the knowledge of the occupation of Poland is not as universal as you may think. To many """"the Nazis"""" does not mean the Germans as you suggested. Poland was not occupied by the """"Nazis"""" who came from """"Greenland or Mars"""" or """"Nazi allies"""". Poland was occupied by the Nazi Germany or German Army (Wehrmacht) and at the beginning of the war also by the Soviet Union or Red Army. There were no other German allied troops occupying Poland unless you count Italian, Spanish and other Waffen SS troops marching to the Eastern Front. """"The German-led Nazi occupation"""" you suggested is also incorrect, there was no such thing. Half of Poland was incorporated into the Third Reich with their citizens either murdered or expelled into the """"General Government"""" which was created and %100 controlled by the Nazi Germany, nobody else. 
Therefore he """"Nazi"""" is NOT a perfectly good word to use in this case and never will be.
Now, about the Polanski who in your opinion is not a Holocaust survivor. Well...he escaped the Cracow Ghetto on the way to the extermination camp. He would be dead otherwise. Then he barely survived hiding at sympathetic to him farmers barn avoiding the Germans who would kill him immediately if found. Every Jew hiding outside the Ghettos was immediately shot by the Germans. His rescuers and rescuers family was also killed.  I don't dare to suggest that you did not know about that.

Suggestions

(1) Might it be useful to """"update"""" Wittgenstein's contributions to various academic and philosophical inquiries? It seems that Wittgenstein's use of language games and place of language in experience has experienced something of a revival among some postmodern academics. 

In particular, his own transition from """"representational"""" to """"lived"""" semiotic is in itself interesting as a presage of the movement from a """"representational"""" to a """"community"""" derivation of language / meaning. 

I'm no Wittgenstein expert (just stumbled upon this interesting, if frustrating, discussion) and any credentials I might have had to the """"philosopher's club"""" have probably long expired, but a part of my doctoral work did float in and around meaning, words, classification and the uses we make of themvia semiotics. Thus I am eminently unqualified to write such a piece, though I can see a hole on the bookshelf where something like it might just fit. 

That is, philosophy did not end with Adorno, or even with Habermas. Some young buck out there, can you tell whether this connection (Wittgenstein's work on language and postmodern approaches to community-as-language) has developed at all in contemporary (21st century) philosophical work? 

Might be nice to see something pragmatic as well as historic. . .(of course they are not mutually exclusive. . .)

(2) On the issue of Wittgenstein's alleged personal quirks:

Given the absolute delight with which students of philosophy embrace all that is eccentric in the lives of the authors with whose works they are cursed to try and read (see Philosopher's Song. . .any campus)

and 

the somewhat unsettling popular idea that the most brilliant men (almost always men) are proportionately looney (perhaps explaining the less-brilliant lives of mostly normal people?) as well as

the difficulty of actually nailing down with precise sources most of what happened in Europe during either of the """"world wars,"""" but in particular the secondthere was an awful lot of bombing and burning by both sides

it might be difficult to come up with primary source material that would either confirm or deny even positions held forth in academic lectures but unpublished, let alone personal eccentricities (after all, if the people writing about these eccentricities were themselves brilliant, their own opinions of normalcy should be correspondingly suspect, see the """"it takes one to know one"""" argument)

So

perhaps we should cobble together a """"tribute"""" page to which all of the strange and probably unprovable and just as probably unimportant traits, stunts, personal traits, learned tricks and inept relationships of all such """"brilliant but eccentric"""" wiki subjects can point?

Thus the eccentricities (which, if not so important, are entertaining enough that folks will be motivated to search dilligently for evidence enough to warrant a smirk) can be acknowledged with a neat and proper cite through a proper point to another wikipedia page

but 

the """"eccentricities"""" page itself would be self-evidently immune from the precision of source usually required of biographies of thought, (by the way, why is it we assume that someone's date and place of birth is important to the formation of their intellectual ideas?) 

and would be a riotous read. (potentially Wiki's most commonly cited article)

This might satisfy both the """"biography of ideas"""" and the """"biography of real peoples behind the ideas"""" folks by allowing the hint or shadow of perhaps something utterly crazy to fall across the screen without an actual commission of the crime of citing one wack-o's account of another wack-o (non-traditional spelling intentional).

Paradoxically, this page might already exist, and merely lacks more """"slept with sheep but only within a platonic framework"""" entries in order to accumulate enough word-weight to produce a big enough ripple when it is dropped into the swimming pool of ideas. After all, it wouldn't probably be listed where any boring (and thus non-brilliant) person might expect. . .

 Borisoglebsk 2 

After testing of the new Russian """"anti-high-tech"""" Borisoglebsk 2 in Ukraine, this new Russian weapon system appears to jam all communication as well as GPS-system. Hence a question about all other """"high-tech"""" weapon rises. This has suddenly frightened American military as well as NATO. According to (a right wing) Swedish morning newspaper, with good international reputation.
I can't see what was undue in my contibution. Can America just take it for granted that F-35 can't be stopped by Borisoglebsk 2 ? It doesn't seem so to me. OK it's early days still, but fact is neither the American Airforce or NATO know if the Borisoglebsk 2 system will make the F-35 inoperable. But EMP pulses from huge nuclear detornations and from the sun is no news. Neither is jamming. I think all possible counter weapons belongs to the weapon article. (Also if/when an anti-Borisoglebsk 2 weapon is invented.) 
Generally ,if the best assult weapon can be made inoperable by a even better defence system, such matters goes together. And it's not I who ask whether the F-35 stands up towards the Borisoglebsk 2, according to the source, ist it NATO and America who wonders. (Presumably Russia as well)   """,0,0,0,0,0,0

You know that the name change is not at all the whole point here. The problems here such as heavily relying on Chinese sources, inaccuracy in historical facts, copying government propaganda, are commonplace not only in this particular article but most all topics on nations colonized under China. And further, if the current situation continues on Wikipedia, you cannot guarentee the so called NPOV. Not only that will be a joke, the whole Wikipedia thing will end up being another hypocratic, """"civilization"""" game. The biggest issue here is the mentality behind the creation of these articles and problems here, hence the debate and this is just the beginning. You have to realize that the overwhelming articles on China-occupied regions on Wikipedia are full of POV but not NPOV. So don't keep fulling yourselves. It's time to wake up now.

Those who're currently in advantageous positions here, are so not because they're intelectually and morally strong but just because their numbers are bigger. They are basically consisted of two types: One types are those Chinese who're either been brainwashed and/or are chauvinistic fanatics. And the other types are Americans who (naturally) have so little knowledge about the world outside of northern America. But then they would have hard time admitting that and therefore, they will end up either pretending as they know or they would simply echo the Chinese POV which is largely circulated and readily available. For them, the famous saying, which goes like if you repeat a lie a thousand times it would become the truth, will make perfect sense. That """"truth"""", or what you guys are shouting here as """"the common"""" names and stuff, is exactly what is blocking not only your eyesights but as well your human consciousness.

One big difference between the two types though are that the Chinese here do know what they are doing because they have their agenda and they're intentional. But the Americans are just naive and are being used.

 Final Edit 

Since I'll never be editing Wikipedia again, I thought I'd add a few notes here for the benefit of the few people involved who aren't delusional.  One day, I logged on to discover that I had been accused of being someone else and was facing being banned as a result.  When I objected, instead of being banned for being someone else, I was banned for objecting.  The person who did the banning had been carrying a grudge for literally years, having been caught trying to ban me for similar ludicrously and transparently self-serving reasons years earlier, only to have his malicious action overturned.  In the years since he had been initially caught, the administrators who had cared one way or the other slowly dropped away as Wikipedia slid into its own navel.  A larger and larger proportion of Wikipedia's dwindling contributions are being directed towards bureaucracy and petty politics.  This is always the sign of a community rapid decline.  I do not anticipate that Wikipedia will be relevant for much longer, though it may linger for decades as an increasingly toxic MMORPG for authoritarian sperglords.

The proof that this ban has nothing to do with my contributions and everything to do with my legitimate criticism of Wikipedia is that my user page (containing criticism of the systemic biases within Wikipedia and the noxious atmosphere within its community  which had already survived one attempt at censorship through official channels) was gleefully blanked once I no longer had the power to fix it, complete with mocking """"buh-bye"""" commentary.

Eric Hoffer wrote, """"You can discover what your enemy fears most by observing the means he uses to frighten you.""""  I never cared about Wikipedia; I came here because a blatantly libellous biography about me had sat untouched for months and only when it was corrected to make it factually correct, only then action was taken to have it removed on the basis of being a """"non-notable"""" and a """"vanity"""" article.  In the years since that initial experience, nothing I've experienced has done anything to contradict my distaste with the bullying, authoritarian culture within Wikipedia, and serves to confirm my suspicions about the sort of society Randroids like Jimbo would like to foist on us.  It is, however, telling that the worst punishment Wikipedia's brownshirt enforcers can think to enforce upon me is to prevent me from contributing to their project.  If I was a troll and an agent provocateur, clearly I wouldn't care and, in any case, could easily create more accounts.  I know several people who do just that.  It's obvious that the people who want so desperately to silence me and my unthinkable criticism of the wildly dysfunctional culture within Wikipedia don't really think I'm a troll or a sock puppeteer or whatever other excuses they've dragged up for silencing me; it's that I infuriatingly refuse to consider it some kind of glorious reward to give free labour to Wikipedia.

It's an odd situation, to be forcefully barred from rowing the oars on a sinking ship, for the apparently inexcusable crime of noting that the ship is sinking.  Even now, I suspect that this final commentary will be removed, because the presence of discordant voices inside the echo chamber of Wikipedia is intolerable, even when those voices are trying to draw attention to a problem which will ultimately destroy the very community which is providing the milieu in which the echo chamber ostensibly exists to protect.  Some of the people involved clearly have a long and well-documented history of cognitive distortions which leave them largely unable to either control or be held morally culpable for their actions.  It's not these people, the sadly delusional acolytes of Jimbo, to whom I address this, but the few remaining people within Wikipedia who have closed their eyes to what's occuring.  I don't have any desire to be re-chained to the oars, so this isn't about shaming anyone into overturning the decision of the kangaroo court which silenced me on Wikipedia.  This is about getting the more-or-less sane people to feel some sense of personal responsibility for refusing to either make the attempt to stand up to the bullies or remove themselves from the culture which fosters and supports the bullies.

Hi, 

I used various news paper accounts from that period as well as other sources. That was in an era before my writing improved and i started referencing sources better. I could never find anything to truly complete though. I actually meant to go clean up the 1902 article and change the party affiliations to Government, Opposition and Independents and its various permutations some day. It was written on the somewhat false assumption that Government candidates were automatically Liberal-Conservatives and Opposition candidates were Liberals.

This was the first mention i found of Northwest Territories parties and early elections which is what drove me to discover when the early elections were held, because Wikipedia had no information what so ever for early NWT elections at that time.

Also the Parliament website that has MP's and Senators who were MLA's sometimes has party affiliations for that period in their Federal Political Experience.
 
Some articles from the 1898 territorial election mention races being fought on party lines. The Glenbow museum also had mention of communications from the Northwest Territories Liberal-Conservative Association from 1898, although I may have been mistaken as that was probably a federal party communication. 

There defiantly was a Northwest Territories Conservative and Liberal party though as this article proves  < A wealth of information on who was actually in the party, and it hints there was prior conventions.

And in approaching the matter in this way, I in no way violated the principle of WP:Consesus, to which I am fully committed as an editor; had Swordfish reverted again, I would have opened a discussion on the article's talk page, but it's not your place to just assume his reaction to my new evidence and insist on a particular course of action in resolving the (non)issue between the two of us.  Your actions in this case, and especially your tone in your edit summaries, seem to suggest that you feel you are in a position to dictate the methodologies of other editors with regard to work flow and communication, but in this case you have no policy argument to support this behaviour and no special position in the community entitling you to interfere in this manner, especially when you had no reason to believe the matter was not already dealt with to the satisfaction of the original parties involved.

This was a discussion based on WP:Verifiability alone, a matter that, until someone tells me otherwise, seems to have been resolved.  If you decide that you have issue with the sources in question, how they should be referenced, or the content itself, fine I urge you to open a talk page discussion on it.  However, if you continue to meddle and revert my content again on no other basis than trying to enforce your preferred procedure, clearly an administrator will have to straighten the matter out.",0,0,0,0,0,0

MOVED BACK FROM MY TALK PAGE:
 Moved from London Victory Parade discussion page 

As this exchange has nothing to do with the topic of the article and has everything to do with you assuming that I am editing in bad faith and trying to catch me out in a way which is quite frankly pathetic, I am moving it from that discussion page to your talk page.  

What is the title of the book you wrote about Warsaw, Varsovian? Do you know what """"M-ka"""" is ? You lived in Warsaw for ten years , you said above. Please tell me what M-ka is.  
Travellers Warsaw. Not only do I have no idea what M-ka is but my assistant (27 years old, born in Warsaw and lived here her whole life) and the professor in the office next to me (56 years old and spent entire life in Warsaw) have no idea what you're talking about either.  
What part of Warsaw you or your assistant lived in?  
I live in Muranow, she lives in Saska Kepa. Has this got anything to do with the London Victory Parade of 1946?  
Is this the book you wrote?..I'm sure the answer is in a very book you claim to write... Ask your assistant what is N24-rka then. I'm really trying hard to convince myself that you are a real account. Please help me. Thansk  
No, I wrote the second edition. And took about a quarter of the photos too. Why not buy a copy and read it from cover to cover: you will not find the words M-ka or N24-ka anywhere in it. However, you will find a rather good joke about Copernicus (or at least a good joke for anybody who knows their Monty Python).  
Well...if you lived in Warsaw and your assistant lived in Saska Kepa whole her life she would for sure knew what N24-rka is. It is the number of only night bus that goes to Saska Kepa. People in Warsaw or """"Varsovians"""" just know these things. I was born in Warsaw and I lived there for many years. Everybody knows buses and trams numbers especially in their areas. EVERYBODY. If you asked me what M-ka or N24-rka is I would tell you right away and even in the middle of the night. But thanks anyway Varsovian.  
You really are comedy gold! Firstly, to speak for myself I have no idea which night bus I would take to get home: I use these things called taxis. Secondly my assistant says that you are an idiot (although I would never use such incivil language to you). N24 does not go to Saska Kepa: it goes to Praga-Poludnie. To get to Saska Kepa she would take N72.  
Of course Varsovian...whatever you say[].  
Thank you for yet again implying that I am a liar. I do wonder if it is ever possible for you to actually be civil towards people. Thank you for your comments as to which bus goes where. I suggest that you contact ZTM (the Warsaw municipal transport company) and tell them that their website is completely wrong: they list the N24 as not going to Saska Kepa  and the N72 as going to Saska Kepa . But obviously you are right and they (and people who actually live in Warsaw) are wrong.

BARBARO

I left some comments on F550's talk page. I think how Wikipedia has treated this F550 and the Barbaro family was unfair. I also noticed that this individual seems to have just tried to edit his name out of those two bogus societies, which seems fair to me, and Wikipedia editors keeps bringing it back. It seems like Wikipedia's disregard for others is very cruel. just my thoughts 

I also left some comments too on genio or ganios talk page too 

 Excuse me Gustav, your contribution with adding San Francesco della Vigna was actually not correct. I left a comment for you on Giano's talk page. I think everyone is desperately trying to piece inconsequential tid-bit in hope that something resembling an article might show up. The original version I saw a month ago was just fine and accurate.

Gustav, I just had a chance to look at the history of the Barbaro family page. Why was the article listed as the """"TRUE BARBARO FAMILY ARTICILE..."""" removed. That is the one that should be the official Barbaro family page. It has excellent Zorzi sources and clearly is structured in a not only a factual way, but also a way that captures the true spirit and soul of the family. This aricle that you have replaced it with is crummy.

Why isn't this page flagged """"under construction"""". You gotta be kidding me if this is the official article that is constructed for the great Barbaro family. Please say it isn't so. This has got to be the worst article I have ever seen on Wikipedia. This thing stinks! Usually articles this dinky are flagged as stubs asking for people to expand on them. I think it is time to admit Gustav that you are out of your league. Clearly the person that constructed the former Barbaro family article was an Art Historian that new this family and proper sources well. 

 
 HYPER-INDIVIDUALIST@YAHOO.COM IS IN ON THE HOAX!  

This hyper guy is in on it with Tiki-two. They planned to damage the Barbaro family page all long. First they started bogus societies which they knew would lead to the family page being destroyed. They planned it well. Tiki used the same company computer which would discredit the family's input and this hyper guy stayed out from editing so he would seem clean. But how come the conversation on the secret society talk page is only between Tiki and Hyper. Even his tag looks suspicious, """"Hyper-individualist"""". Watch this guy very closely. I think the Barbaro family needs an I'm sorry. Because I noticed that whenever it seems like the Barbaro page was going to be restored, than all of a sudden Hyper jumped in with Hoax Hoax! Very sneaky and well timed Hyper. I see what is going on. How can anyone discredit all of the evidence that was given in supportfor the family. I get you Hyper. You were the straight man and Tiki played the opposite role, but you are both as guilty-without any doubt! This guy just magically comes across an ebay purchase out of the blue from ebay back records. Yeah right-Ok Hyper!

 EXCUSE ME! THE ALBERGO TIE IS WITH THE GRIMALDI OF GENOA AS SAID IN THE PROPER SOURCE LISTED PREVIOUSLY_ YOUR BOGUS REWRITTING OF HISTORY WILL NOT BE TOLLERATED AND YOU WILL BE REPORTED TO WIKIPEDIA!

 """"Peace and tolerance"""" are underpinned by their belief that muslims should unite against their common enemy which they believe is Western dominance of Islamic Ummah, in particular US and Israeli domination/occupation. This resonates with the call by the late founder of Islamic Republic of Iran, Ayatollah Khomeini for Islamic unity and resistance against the West, and that's also one reason the Houthis are claimed to be supported or influenced by Iran. The other ground for their tolerance is their opposition to Salafism/Al-Qaeda which is widely known as an intolerant, extremist and terrorist Islamic group which has engaged in sectarian infighting and division in the Islamic Ummah rather than staging any real, honorable resistance against Western domination. They have in fact destroyed the public image of Islam by committing all sorts of wrongs and excesses such as indiscriminate violence against non-Salafists and non-mulims and pretty much anyone who doesn't adopt their ideology. I'm elaborating on this to help better make sense of the Houthi ideology and such characterizations offered by the Yemeni professor. Also see how this is in line with the Newsweek identification of Houthi descent cause as being shared by all Yemenis. Houthis are genuinely inspired by Shia Islam but that's also exactly why they are striving for indiscriminate well-being of all muslims. You need to study about Shia Islam to understand this, especially Shia distinct appreciation for reason and universal justice.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Thanks Flyer22 that was not my guess.  Here's what the NBC website says, the official site, not a message board: Lucas was injured when a beam fell on his legs and EJ agreed to save Lucas only if Sami agrees to let EJ have his way with her. Sami reluctantly had sex with EJ and helped him escape to Mexico, after he was wanted in connection with the shooting of John Black. Despite Sami’s attempt to turn over a new leaf, EJ returned and pressed her for information on police activities, and she was pulled into another web of deception, trying to prevent him from learning she was pregnant. That's from Sami Brady.  That tells me the show's official position is that she agreed.  What a character says and what the show's position is in this case are not the same.  Since Ed Scott took over, only Lucas has used the word and Sami and EJ have shared a couple of kisses as well as reading the Santo and Colleen letters together.

Wikipedia is not bound to avoid mentioning them at all, just because some council of Bishops wants them to be suppressed.  Bringing up what historians say is a red herring, because as you well know, plenty of historians can be found who say they are ALL frauds, hence there is nothing alongside historians to differentiate one set from the other set.  The only differentiation comes from your personal beliefs, or from the declaration of some council.  And please note, we are just mentioning them in the article as existing  not stating which ones are """"true"""" or """"untrue"""".  We've clearly stated that they aren't part of the canon. It's wrong to pretend they don't exist, and to suppress all mention of them, based on which ones you, bishops, or even historians personally might feel are """"untrue"""".  They are noteworthy simply because they are ancient.   (ውይይት)

 Unprotect Augusto Pinochet - See Talk:Augusto Pinochet. Veriverily isn't explaining his objections to text he keeps reverting over and over again.  
The page is already protected. Is this a request for unprotection?  
Yes, please unprotect this page.  
Sorry, but in spite of your efforts I don't think the discussion has reached enough of a resolution right now to avoid a resumption of the revert war as soon as the page is unprotected.  
Veriverily only chooses to lodge personal attacks against me as long as he manages to censor any facts that he feels might reflect negatively on the U.S. by means of a page protection. There cannot be a discussion unless the page protection is lifted. If we have to wait for Veriverily, the page might as well be protected permanently.  
Refer to the large number of people who have put effort into this article - Ed Poor, Cadr, Cantus, Eloquence - while 172 seeks to sabotage our efforts at working together and impose his own agenda.  The Talk pages are available, so one can see 172 is lying.  Although I have aired my frustration with 172 several times there, the issues have also been much discussed by me and others (i.e., """"only"""" yeah right).  As Cadr said on this very page ,  """"Agree with VV. A lot of constructive work was being done on the page; the problems are almost enitrely down to the user he mentions."""" (in ref to 172)  As soon as the protection is off, 172 will continue his activities.  V

Unprotect Augusto Pinochet. Cadr and Veriverily refuse to back down one inch, and no one else seems to be paying any attention. Is this page just going to be protected indefinitely?  

See brief discussion below and, for the patient, that at Talk:Augusto Pinochet.  It tells a very different story. - V 
To summarize, it is 172 who refuses to budge and alter one word of the intro he wrote.  All other parties have written several draft intros each to try to accommodate objections and concerns.  172 dismisses these efforts as """"partisan bickering"""" and """"bullshit"""". - V 
Veriverily's comments are misleading at best. """"All other parties,"""" according to Veriverily, are the users (Cadr, EdPoor, AstroNomer, and himself) voting in the minority in the most recent round of polling. His preferred version does not have a """"consensus"""" behind it. This was really the winning position in the poll: """"Yes, it should be asserted, in both the intro paragraph and the CIA role in coup section, and not marked as controversial.""""  
Consensus had been reached before 172 started trolling; the poll was started afterwards and brought in random buddies of 172.  The poll voters he cites consist mostly of users who had no role in editing or contributing to the page and visibly no understanding of the issues and were voting ideologically.  Even so, the margin was only 8-5, far from overpowering.  Furthermore, one does not vote on whether to be neutral. - V 

I wasn't  """"brought in"""" to vote. Nor was I voting """"ideologically"""", rather my vote was determined by my familiarity with the issues. Perhaps instead of attacking anyone who voted differently from him V V should present more compelling arguments  

Who am I attacking?  And saying I """"should present more compelling arguments"""" supports my supposition that you were not aware of the talk of these issues, because if so you would have seen the thousands and thousands of words arguing these very points. - V 

I wasn't  """"brought in"""" to vote, I wasn't voting """"ideologically"""" and I have made (minor) contributions to the article.
 

Regardless of who the poll may have """"brought in"""", I think part of the purpose of listing this page at Wikipedia:Requests for comment, where it has appeared quite regularly for a while, is to """"bring in"""" opinions from members of the community.

Rather than surveying scientists, look at the fundamentals.  Effects of water are dominant over CO2.   I’m told that IPCC models apply controversial positive feedback factors to enhance the effect of CO2, and using values that are too high would explain why their models do not fit recent observations.  Illustrative links follow: -

Water vapour dominates.

One is that you should stop focusing on whether or not your indefblock was justified.

 References 

Hi, don't be confused with WP:CITE. The current state of Germany article already conforms with WP:CITE, that you use Footnote style of citing together with inline citations. So when you simply added the long list of books/publications in a newly created References section and you said that they were copy-pasted from other sub-Germany articles and they were not used in the article, then it is not correct. It should be applied also in other article, such as Canada, but it has been featured, so what can I say? There is WP:FAR for reviewing FA article again, but I guess it is not a fatal mistake in Canada. Probabily, your timing was not right. When one reviewer asked about printed sources, you answered him/her by copy-pasting a list of references. That looked like a show-off action and made him/her think that you are not serious of taking his/her comments. —  (reply) — """,0,0,0,0,0,0

Dear author,

Thank you for replying.

(I just figured out the dialogue moves down, not up, so this post is a little out of order. Sorry. I was the guy with the PhD pastor/father. Currently my last post is at the top of the page.)

To be honest, I wasn't sure if you checked out this site anymore, so I didn't know if I could engage you in a dialogue. Although you used your real nameI don't know where to look to find itI don't know you personally. I don't think so, anyway. I'm relatively young, so chances are I just don't know you. 

It is not my intent to present a point by point rebuttal to your articleespecially because most of what you have written needs no rebuttal; it is true. 

Actually, my pastor told me that someone called him to discuss the content of the article and the responses tacked on to it, and he deduced that I may have been the author of one of the entries. I checked my entry just to make sure I didn't sound too hereticalsince I confessed to not being entirely supportive of everything the organization has ever done in its 100 years of history. I was excited to see that you had responded to my previous entry.

In regards to a couple of points you make, I think your facts might be offparticularly when you say the church does not trust formal educators. My father, a pastor, is also a full-time college professor, and heads college departments from time to time. He is without a doubt a formal educator. And I know of at least one formal educator sitting on the church board, who has his seminary degree from some place (Fuller? I dunno. It starts with an F, I think.) that is fully accredited.

And, in regards to divorce and remarriage, while some might adamantly agree with your interpretation of the doctrine of our church, there are allowances in certain situationsbut I'll agree, not much. 

You're absolutely right when you say that our branch churches pay tithes to our headquarters church, and that the church headquartered in Portland holds annual, international campmeetings; but I'm not sure that the campmeetings are held primarily so that our organization can command consistencythough this is assuredly a consideration in an organization with hundreds of congregations and ministers in Africa, Asia, North America, Australia, and Europe (maybe elsewhere, too. I'm not sure). With so many cultures and backgrounds influencing our individual and corporate outlooks, it seems to me that a little consistency between continents is a good thing. 

While some of our older standards or traditions may feel burdensome to many of us Americans, we as a church have to consider our worldwide culture, especially in the African countries where our church is so pervasive to the culture that we are a considerable economic factor. While we American Apostolics mightand that's a big mightbe able to change flexibly to meet the demands of our own culture, doing so will always affect thousands and thousands around the globe. As silly as it sounds, dropping a standard as (seemingly) trivial as wedding-rings could cause a major international split in the church, which in turn might cause no small amount of political and economic upheaval in an already unstable Nigeria. It is an unlikely scenario, I imagine, but those are the kinds of things we must consider, and our annual campmeetings help us become more aware of those issues, and enable us to deal with them more effectivelyamong other things. In situations like this, it is that consistency you mentioned that leads us to retain traditions and standards our own culture might find dusty, antique, or outdated. 

But when you say that our organization tries to make every branch the same, I have to disagree. Maybe your aware of history that I am notbut that is history. Our current overseer (superintendant general) immediately took most of the direct power out of his hands as his first act of officehe created a separate office to head our overseas work, and then he created regional supervisors who could better manage the needs of specific areas. If anything, the evidence points to an allowance of cultural expression and identityeven encouragement and appreciation of those differences. It seems like we are growing into a church that appreciates the different applications of identical teachings.

But what interests me most is what you refer to as unethical treatment of you and your family. Honestly, I have no idea what you've gone through, but I thoroughly believe it hurt you and your family deeply, and I wish it had never happened. Truly, I do not know who you are, and while a public post on a website is a terrible place for personal discussions, I wish there was some way I could hear more about what you had to go through.

Wolter added that immediately prior to the premier of """"America Unearthed,"""" several articles he had written or contributed to in Wikipedia had been simultaneously “gutted” or deleted by a self-appointed Wikipedia editor in rural England named Doug Weller.  Wikipedia provides little information on Doug Weller other than that he has been designated a “purple gatekeeper.” Weller has no professional qualifications in geology. Until 2006 he claimed to be an archaeologist, but withdrew that claim when exposed. Surprisingly, Weller has also been editing Wikipedia articles about the history of the Southeastern United States.

ce771080ccaadf8c,"Wikipedia is a source of information on a huge range of issues and topics, many of which do not get an airing in conventional references; it is particularly useful in providing details on obscure flags across the planet that are not often featured in standard works.  Included in Wikipedia’s annals are the flags for example, of Khuzestani Arabs, ethnic Somalis in Kenya,  the Bakonjo of Uganda, the Turks of western Thrace – some decidedly obscure banners but I am grateful to Wikipedia contributors for providing information on these myriad groups which  allows me to know exactly whom these designs represent and understand the context when I see them aloft on news reports and elsewhere. Why therefore are we to be denied similar access to information concerning the extant flag in the English county of Dorset? 
The fact is that a gold flag with a red edged white cross, designated the “Dorset Cross”, can be seen flying across the county; it is also a fact that the town council in the Dorset town of Wimborne has embraced this as their preferred county flag. The design is therefore a tangible reality, that has evident popularity and the full support of a local authority, what factor in these circumstances makes the Dorset Cross ineligible for inclusion in Wikipedia? One might argue that the Dorset Cross is not an official flag - how many of the examples cited above can claim to be official? The four snakes and cross flag depicted in the entry on Martinique in fact specifically states that this is an “unofficial region flag” however, one presumes that it actually flies in the island i.e. it exists and is possessed of a certain popularity and is therefore worthy of note. How does the circumstance in Dorset differ? As in Martinique, the Dorset Cross flag is not official; as in Martinque, the flag can be seen flying in many places, how is this flag then not worthy of mention or depiction in Wikipedia? A trawl across the internet reveals that there are two flags currently commercially available as Dorset flags – one is a banner of the arms of the County Council, which design the general public is not legally entitled to fly, the other is the Dorset Cross, which the public demonstrably are flying but this reality is not being reflected in Wikipedia, where we currently have an illustration of the banner of the arms but none of the Dorset Cross – this strikes me as imbalanced and tendentious. 
The Dorset Cross is a contender in a current competition held under the auspices of the Dorset County Council to select a flag that they will themselves endorse. The competition itself is of course worthy of mention and when all the contenders are revealed they should of course all appear in Wikipedia but the fact is that notwithstanding said competition, the Dorset Cross is already flying and predates the competition and Wikipedia, in not allowing its depiction is guilty of misinformation. One relies on Wikipedia to advise that the flag of the Dinka is a five striped horizontal design and takes such advice on good faith; how odd therefore that one should not be similarly able to consult this resource on a flag that one can see flying in the streets and all about.User:Vexilo",0,0,0,0,0,0

Hello, you placed the critique of “too many pictures” at the top of the Antonio Diego Voci page and suggested I review “Manual Style on Images” I had already used that guide to originally construct the Antonio Diego Voci page.  I have just refreshed myself as suggested.
 
1.      Comparison to the Wikipedia recommended “Timpani” revised page finds the Antonio Diego Voci page to be similar in both layout and ratio of images to text, and thus is in compliance. 
2.      One item I overlooked and in good faith will now correct is the caricature of Diego’s father-in-law so that he is looking toward the text and not away from it, and thus be in compliance.
3.      The images within the text are all relevant to specific items in the text, located together as close as the system allows and thus are in compliance.
4.      Since I could not find any Wikipedia specific numbers for quantity of images to include in the gallery, I used as my guide other notable artists with pages which Wikipedia suggested.  I found that the Cezanne Gallery had a similar number, Renoir had several more, and Monet had twice as many; therefore again by comparison of numbers are in compliance.
 
NOTE: Relating to the Gallery, Diego was highly accomplished in several genres.  I culled from hundreds of image choices to illustrate Diego’s versatility identified by Genre: Works, Faces, Surrealism, Cubism, Clowns/Harlequins/Musicians, Landscapes, and Horses/Boats.  I wanted to add Fauvism, Figures and Abstract but, decided to err on the conservative side for total numbers of images.
 
5.      Lastly, to show my good faith to the conscientious editor, I eliminating 5 images from the body of the text.  Removed is one of the 2 Native Indian images.  And somewhat reluctantly, 4 images of official government documents which I felt added credibility.  They will now be found scanned documents.
 
In closing, compliance with Wikipedia has been and IS my objective for the Antonio Diego Voci page.  Maintaining the highest integrity, accuracy and visual appeal is vital to both Wikipedia and the reputation of Antonio Diego Voci.

A Nursing Model – Hildegard E. Peplau from Townsend, M. Essentials of Psychiatric Mental Health Nursing: Concepts of Care in Evidence-Based Practice. Chapter 1, 25-28. 6 ed. F.A. Davis Company. Philadelphia. 2014.

The referenced literature presents the Nursing Model of Peplau is based on an interpersonal theory structured on the nurse-client relationship development. Peplau created the Psychological tasks as a learning process which nurses could help their patients achieve personal maturity, since their illnesses have been caused by breaks or failed development during this process. The four Psychological tasks are learning to control others, learning to delay satisfaction, identifying oneself, and developing skills in participation. These stages are classified by age, childhood, following concepts developed by Freud and Sullivan. There are some important understandings about Peplau’s nursing model: Nursing is a human relationship, Psychodynamic nursing is a tool to oneself and other-selves development, and Rules are social establishments important to keep functional the social structure. As an example of nursing rules Peplau define social actors as a stranger, resource person, counselor, teacher, leader, technical expert and surrogate. These actors have an important function to improve the relationship between nurse and patient. The nursing-client relationship is oriented by four phases, Orientation, Identification, Exploitation and Resolution. The Peplau’s model provides the nurse as a facilitator of the process of the client development, where the professional - armed with the rules and techniques – interacts through relationship with the client to achieve a missed learning and maturing process.

 Preference revelation and revealed preference theory 

I recently created the stub preference revelation to function as an overview of the work that's been done in the area of determining what your preference are.  In this entry it states, """"The search for observables in microeconomics is taken even further by revealed preference theory"""".  Samuelson's theory, while by far the most popular, is just one of several notable theories.  

I also created actions speak louder than words and put your money where your mouth is to highlight the economic significance of those two expressions...but I ran into difficulties with editors who are not very familiar with the area of preference revelation.  There's plenty of RS that discuss the economic significance of those two expressions...and they can go a long way to help people understand the topic.

Just wanted to bring these entries to the attention of anybody who is interested in the topic.    """,0,0,0,0,0,0

I am failing this article because it has two major issues: referencing and image use. You need references for the comic's censorship, especially, since that is a potentially controversial claim, but also throughout the history section. On image use, we have one free image, which is great, but we also have one non-free image with no rationale, and neither image is being used informatively within the article. Since fixing these issues will require searching out additional sources (usually time-consuming) and possibly substantial rearrangement of the article format, I'm going with a fail rather than a hold.

Having worked in radio for 18+ years in the Harrisonburg, Virginia area, and having worked for WACL (98 Rock) for 5 years (ending in 2005), I have respectfully asked that the format information for this station be changed to reflect it's official format, which is Classic Rock. The station's official format is Classic Rock, not Rock, Album Oriented Rock and not Active Rock. I received this response from users who will not allow me to edit the content myself:

    """"I talked with that other user and he said since WACL """"makes no clear distinction in its marketing (and based on the station website and group website, it doesn't) either rely on the Arbitron listing (which is derived from the station's own reporting)"""" it should fall under the Rock label. Not AOR, or Classic Rock, just plain old Rock. I will make a note in the article that the station plays a 50/50 """"blend"""" of Classic Rock and Active Rock. - NeutralHomer • Talk • """"

In my opinion, the accuracy of the content depends on fact, not on how the station markets itself, and not on Wikipedia users' opinions of what the station sounds like. The station does, in fact, rely on Arbitron when creating sales pitches to their advertisers, and Arbitron lists the station as Classic Rock because the station has reported to Arbitron that it's official format is Classic Rock. Having an extensive amount of professional experience in radio in Harrisonburg, Virginia qualifies me as an expert on this particular subject. Again I ask that the following changes be made to the content on the WACL article:

    WACL (98.5 FM, """"98 Rock"""") is a Classic Rock formatted broadcast radio station licensed to Elkton, Virginia, USA, serving the Harrisonburg/Staunton, Virginia, area. WACL is owned and operated by Clear Channel Communications.

    History

    The station first launched on February 22, 1989, with the callsign WPKZ. During that time, the station would carry a country music format, branded as """"Z-98"""".

    On March 7, 1997, the format was changed to classic rock, branded as """"Cool 98.5"""". To accommodate this, the callsign was changed to WACL. On May 2, 2001 at midnight, WACL changed their branding to """"98 Rock"""". On April 1, 2008, WACL began carrying the syndicated radio program Nights with Alice Cooper, when it moved from WBHB-FM at 105.1 FM (now WTGD) to WACL-FM at 98.5 FM when the format had been switched to classic country.

    Music

    WACL plays a blend of Classic Rock and Active Rock.

The current content is completely inaccurate and non-verifiable. Because I am an expert, I am considered a verifiable source according to Wikipedia.

I'm a little puzzled both by the inclusion of this shape and it's linked picture. The limit of the fractal described is just a square. It seems a little strange to consider this a fractal. I know some 'fractal curves' cover the unit square in the limit, but these have other interesting properties in general (continuity, parametrization of the square..) I'm not sure the 'greek cross fractal' needs to be mentioned so much given that it doesn't seem to be a particularly interesting shape in any obvious way. Furthermore, the picture of the 2d greek cross fractal shows an early stage approximation to it. As mentioned the limit would just be a square. Obviously it's not possible to represent the limit strictly, but I find the picture is a little misleading given the above points. A mathematically unsophisticated reader might think the 'fractal' has some fine structure not present in the square.

 links 

Dharmabum420 and others seem to enjoy removing links from the article. I am not a webmaster or even know one. I found the site outside the wall on my space, and since then have found it to be quicker on posting news and tour info then any of the other sites. I think it deserves a link here with the others. I must admit, I messed up the link by missing a few rules to begin, but since then have fixed that. Dharmabum420 said it seemed self promotion, well I simply just copied the title of the page, it is not self promotion. Since then I have written what features the site holds, but it continues to be removed. Google stats do not legitimate how good a site is for info, and this is NOT a rule by Wikipedia, so stop treating it as one. Thank you, please keep the link 
I would suggest the link be removed until a consensus can be reached here.
I'll assume that it's not self-promotion despite the earlier """"greatest site ever!"""" type description, but regardless, I would personally argue against the inclusion of the site, for a variety of reasons:
Wikipedia is not a link repository, and guidlines suggest only one fan site for such an article, and we already have far more than that.
No Google hit within the first 100 links in a """"pink floyd"""" search and no Alexa rating; while not a set policy on Wikipedia, such rankings are often used to determine a site's notability when trying to decide whether to include the site in an article already well-stocked with other, high-rated sites.
The only content on the site that is not easily available on far more popular sites is a selection of photos of people's tattoos. While mildly interesting, it's hard to argue that it increases the value of the Pink Floyd article itself, as few people who read the article will be searching it out for information on Pink Floyd tattoos.
Much content on the site is commerical, marketing T-shirts and the like. This is clear in the discography, which holds no information other than a simple list of the albums (available on Wikipedia itself anyway) with links to purchase them to an Amazon seller account.
The site in question is very low-quality compared to the rest of the resource links; confusing, messy and difficult to navigate, intrusive music with no way of turning it off, and it has major compatibility problems with Firefox 1.5 and Safari (perhaps others, that's what I've got to try).
That's my 2¢ on this particular site. - a 

I'll double 's 2¢ and even add in another penny to make it an even nickel. It's a very sub-par site and doesn't contribute anything to this article.  

I will disagree with both of you. while you claim only one fan site is appropriate, it clearly states """"Note: fanlistings are generally not informative and should not ordinarily be included.)"""" this fansite is very imformative and has more details on wanted details. For example, this site has details about a On an island live dvd with a direct link to saying David will record the rah shows for a dvd. Visit the other sites, none of them have this info and this is just one instance. You are wrong about it being the normal material. Also after paying attention to this site for sometime, it has continued to be the first in announcing tour dates for Rogers tour, and apparently has already secured a interview with one of Rogers bandmates. While you may think that the videos on the site are annoying, many fans love this. I am one of them, I cant think of another site where I can view much of the videos on this site. You say its difficult to navigate and I laugh at that, there is a simple naviagtion bar at the left hand side of each page, just like fleeting glimpses bar. Also every site has a discography, but very few have a videography, this alon makes this site better then most. So it has some comercial availability...so what? It still is a great source of info. Your google pink floyd rankings are a joke. 80 out of the first 100 are not updated and far subpar then this site. I wonder how many people search for pink floyd tattos, probably far more then you think, because I for one know of no other site that has this, and I have picked a tat from the site to get myself. This site deserves a link and I disagree with both of you

 Also now that I think about it, show me another site that streams Davids mermaid gig, or has each of his promo videos for tracks of the new album? Not even DG.com has those avaialable anymore. Also how about the interview on the Roger waters tour page? Link the other fansite that has this. None do. This site was also the first that had Rogers complete touring band lineu",0,0,0,0,0,0

 Recap 

I decided to withhold further comment until I had some sleep and time to critique the logic behind your deletion decision. I am delaying a trip this morning so that I can provide you with a response to your statement supporting deletion.

Your supporting statement for deletion is as follows: 

""""The result was Delete. The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm, and that the references do not support the notability of the subject. Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted. The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic, and I have counted those opinions as being from User:Julie Dancer. Kevin (talk) """"

As for """"The deletion argument was that this is original research when the article title is used to describe an algorithm..."""" 
In reality the article title names a type of classification which arranges attributes in order of their significance.  Within the deletion discussion itself the calim is made by  at  that other algorithms exist, namely Examples of relevant works are """"A Fast, Bottom-Up Decision Tree Pruning Algorithm with Near-Optimal Generalization"""" and """"An Efficient Algorithm For Optimal Pruning Of Decision Trees"""". which are capable of performing the function the article title names:

If this is accurate then the right way to handle a necessary correction would be to add these algorithms to the article instead of nominating the article for deletion.

In anticipation of these other algorithms being added I immediately changed the body of the text to read """"The algorithm used for this purpose..."""" to """"One algorithm used for this purpose..."""" Since I do not now have access to the article's history as the result of your deletion I can not give you the exact date and time. However, it was prior to the end of the deletion discussion. (Incidentally, it has been suggested by a Professor at Cornell that deleting the article was for the purpose of eliminating the article history.)

Normally as a Wikipedia user I would expect other users who have an issue with such wording to correct it themselves as this is one reason the Wikipedia was setup this way. The Wikipedia still claims to be """"...the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit.""""  

The impression I have now is that while there were an abundance of editors in the beginning who edited articles that there is now an abundance of spoiled children who expect articles to be perfect from the beginning or for someone else to edit them. They simply do not understand that each article is considered to be a work in progress and the Wikipedia being an opportunity to learn how to write and to edit rather than being completed. Instead of doing any work themselves they find it much easier to go around deleting articles which remain incomplete or have not yet reached a state of perfection, especially a maintenance edit like adding an inline reference that would require them to do any real work themselves. 

As for """"...references not supporting the notability of the subject"""" 
You can not logically make this statement without reading the reference or references first and you certainly can not follow this with a statement like """"Despite the verbose nature of the opposing comment, these arguments were not clearly refuted."""" All of the arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted in the text of the primary reference to which I deferred. Just as you saying that a stop light was green in a court of law when you did not look at the light would be a lie so would be claiming the reference did not support notability when you did not read it. I know you did not read the primary reference because all arguments supporting deletion are clearly refuted by the both the primary reference and the references it contains.

As for """"The use of socks to give the appearance of greater support is also extremely problematic...

6c8f0696ce72e006,"""

The main reason I was editing this page is because contributions by user """"Laveol"""" are offensive to the Macedonians. Lazar Kolisevski was a Macedonian, from Republic of Macedonia.
But still he does not deserver to have false information published under his English Wikipedia Page. I have to add that Macedonian Wikipedia Page about Lazar Kolisevski is what the English Page should be edited.
In general there are a lot of negation politics from the Macedonia's neighboring countries. Any of them would negate something about Macedonia: country, nation, language, culture, history, name and so on.
The information from Laveol is in line with this negation policies of those countries, in this case from Bulgaria. Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda is mainly based on negating the Macedonians as a separate nation, Macedonian as a separate language, same about the history.

Given the (non)popularity of Lazar Kolisevski in the modern times Laveol was able to edit the page and have that false information be viewable to Wikipedia users.
This was over that top and I decided to take action about it - Delete the false information, which is not only false, but is offensive to Macedonians and Macedonian People.

When you are Macedonian, your parents are Macedonian. Not Bulgarian or any other nationality.
When you talk about this sensitive topics, you cannot use books published in Bulgaria, as most of them are Propagandistic, working on the principles on 19th century Bulgarian Nationalistic Propaganda and Expansionism.

So the reason why that information by Laveol is deleted by me is that it is false and offensive to Macedonians.

Interestingly, the original Jim Apple wording was nowhere near as benign as your fantasy retort infers: Screenshots can be fairly used when talking about the software or the website, but not when stealing images from the website in question. (Jim Apple )

As you can see, DreamGuy, the notion that I am a thief is not implicit in Jim's statement.  It is cold, open, hostile and obvious.

Am I to fear """"Wikipedia"""" as an entity because it has a policy banning users who """"threaten to sue people""""?  A rule that no doubt emerged to conceal and protect known criminals on board here.  As you may glean from my original text, nary a threat was made.  

Threat is a noun, and defined as:

1. An expression of an intention to inflict pain, 
   injury, evil, or punishment.
2. An indication of impending danger or harm.
3. One that is regarded as a possible danger; a menace.

American Heritage Dictionary, 4th Edition 2000

As is rabidly apparent, none of these definitions apply in even the remotest of extrapolations.
My statements were and remain pure and simple defense against very blatant slander.
(How can the prospect of fair judicial process be regarded as an intent to harm, endanger, 
punish or inflict pain?)  Twist the context to suit whatever dreamworld you inhabit, D.G.,
your opinion cannot alter brutal reality.

The issue at hand:

I have labored rather significantly to improve Tutankhamun, moreso than most.  Wikipedia is in absolutely, ABSOLUTELY no danger IN EVEN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE by utilizing the images I have uploaded, and the truly sickening part is that both of you  Jim, Dream  BOTH OF YOU know it.  There is absolutely zero """"wrong"""" or """"incorrect"""" with the method I have implemented to furnish supplemental illustrations.  You both are completely cognizant of that as well, yet choose to play schoolyard bullies and kick the bricks in on my castle.

Well all right, at least we are getting some debate on the subject.

Paul Siebert - The main contribution of the FCM 36 was the sloped armor on all sides, with the slope of the hull continuous with the turret, so that the tank ended up with a pyramidal shape and a very small turret.   This was exactly the same shape of the T-34 which appeared some 3-4 years later than the FCM 36 and yet the T-34 gets all the credit and accolades as a """"revolutionary design"""" for its sloped armor.   Well, the French came up with that idea first (p. 247-248 in T-34 Mythical Weapon).    Michulec goes further and points out that the pyramidal shape was highly impractical as it resulted in a tiny turret that was all but nonfunctional as the two crewmen could barely aim, load, and fire the gun.  This was why the initial """"flat turret"""" with the steeply sloped sides was replaced by the slightly larger, and less steeply sloped """"hexagonal turret"""" (p. 245).   The later T-34-85 turret was hardly sloped at all in order to maximize space to fit the larger gun.

As for your point about the dysfunctionality of the T-34-76, the early T-34-76 models were the most dysfunctional because of their tiny, steeply sloped turrets and the weak L-11 gun.  The larger hexagonal turret, which was designed to allow for installation of the more powerful F-34 gun was much more functional, but it was still a two man turret lacking a commander.  That problem was not fixed until early 1944 when the T-34-85 finally rolled off the production lines with a three man turret.  The T-34-76 models thus ALL shared this problem of having nearly blind crewmen trying to fight on the battlefield.  The Germans found it very easy to pick them off like ducks because the tank crews had a very limited field of vision, and no way to communicate with other tanks.  There is a description in Healy's Zitadelle  of an episode at the Battle of Kursk where the Soviet T-34s were charging in  and the Germans would just leisurely pick off the T-34s one by one, with all the surviving T-34s completely oblivious to the mass destruction around them.  That was in July 1943.   Michulec's book does show that the Soviets started installing a commanders cupola on the hexagonal turret in the summer of 1943 (p. 123).  Probably learned something from the heavy losses of the Battle of Kursk that the tank crews needed to be able to see what was going on around them.  

Michulec points out that the tank that the Germans most likely did fear and have a lot of trouble with was the KV-1.  The KV-1 had the really tough armor that was resistant to the early German guns (the T-34's thin side armor could be penetrated by the weak guns of the German tanks of 1941) and it had the three man crew that made it a formidable fighting machine on the battlefield.    The T-34-76 crews could simply not see well enough and function inside that tiny turret well enough to be a serious threat to German tanks.    The problem with the KV-1 of course was twofold - it was very slow and sluggish and did not travel through bad terrain very well, unlike the T-34.  And it carried the name of the later discredited Kliment Voroshilov.   Which is probably why in the Soviet retelling of history, the KV-1 gets only a very brief mention.  All the glory gets heaped on the T-34s, which the Germans had no reason to fear because it was not much of a threat to them on the battlefield, due to its dysfunctional tiny two man turret.  Michulec points out that the German generals, especially Guderian, in all probability confused the KV-1 and T-34 in their memoirs.  

____

DMorpheus - I think you are being a bit harsh with Michulec's book.  But at least you recognize the huge amount of work that he put into this thing.  Yes, the photos and drawings are INCREDIBLE.  I think rather than calling the text """"awful"""", it would be more accurate to describe its two major problems:

1. The book was translated by somebody for whom English was a second language.  Not quite as bad as the translation for the movie """"Alexander Nevsky"""", but a bit difficult to understand sometimes.

2. Michulec goes overboard with his obvious anti-Soviet ranting.  Somebody should have just edited all this out, and it would have made the book more professional.

But, if you are able to slug through the difficult translation and filter out the anti-Soviet bias, what you find is that Michulec has packed his book chock full of facts, and he does reference most of his major facts.  Unfortunately those references all seem to be in Russian or Polish or German.   But I think that is where this book shines over books by Zaloga.

This article is about the first Pahlavi Shahanshah who toppled the Qajarid dynasty.

But not as surprising as the tone with which you have assumed.
 

As for Germany, you are not really in a position to compare the brutality of Kemalist autocrats in the Third World (Where much of the society was still held at a tribal level and required strong leaders to commence modernization on a national scale), with the cold-blooded campaign of eradicating """"Untermenschen"""" in the name of Aryan purity (Of which, you are nothing but thieving Germanic apes) during the WW2. Now that is what I call a stain that will never rub off. The same West Germany sold chemical weapons of mass destruction to Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war, where tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers in Iran still suffer from their effects.

And speaking of Gaddafi, the same NATO that hail themselves, ironically, as """"liberators of Libya"""" (In spite of causing civilian casualties) now want financial concessions from that war-torn country! Disgusting Westerner is still a disgusting Westerner.

Hello. First, thanks for your contributions; you're doing some nice work. There are a couple of things I've noticed with your templates that could be improved, however. When you created a new version of Template:Cosmology at Template:Physical cosmology, and then set the old template to redirect to it, you hid the history of the template. Where possible, please put the replacement template at the same location as the old one, or move the old one to the new name, then put the new code in place. (If you're worried about making a mistake on the new template and messing up the articles it's used on, then use a sandbox.) If you do that, then not only do you keep the history of the page, but you make it easier for those of us that are watching the template to see the latest changes to it (i.e. those during and after the replacement). I've requested a history merge on Template:Physical cosmology to fix this (which means an admin will come along and merge the histories of the templates at some point).

Also, please make sure that you don't add extra whitespace (new lines) into the template, as that also appears on the articles if it's not in a noinclude tag. See  for an example of what I mean; your version had two extra lines at the bottom of the article, which were appearing in the articles the template was used on, whereas the problem is now fixed.

Finally, please categorize the templates you make. There's a whole load of template categories under Category:Wikipedia templates; the two you're most likely to be interested in are Category:Physics templates and Category:Astronomical templates (and their subcategories). Categorizing the templates makes it a lot easier for other people to find (and then use) them.

That article is ok I guess, the Androgyny section could use a better explanation, but meh. I dumped some stuff into the section about docking to dead ships/stations, cause it was just so crap and WRONG. Needs some polish now, as I didn't delete anything, just added a nice read which could be trimmed, but that article is very short and could use some meat on it's bones. Anyhow """"the Shenzhou spacecraft could to dock at the International Space Station if it becomes politically feasible in the future"""" still isn't too bad because it's correct. Even if the docking adapters never existed in the first place, the statement is still true. Even if there was no USOS, the statement is still true. You see what I mean ? It could happen, doesn't mean it will, it doesn't rule out or rule in any possibilities, sure we could endlessly qualify it like """"the Shenzhou spacecraft could to dock at the International Space Station if it becomes politically feasible in the future, so long as the station is not deorbited first, or has it's budget cut, or the APAS's are covered, mangled, sold, ejected, stolen by Ivan Ivanovich, america doesn't declare war on china, ESA doesn't declare martial law on columbus"""" and so forth. It's just that it's a correct statement as is, plus, short and sweet. I'm very happy that what you are saying is correct, and belongs somewhere with other future maybe plans, however it has little to do with china because the docking is already tenuous at best, and so not going to happen in the next few years, and if it does, they will need to prepare anyway. So where is the article that outlines a hypothetical docking to the ISS to tell us where it is or isn't ? It's pretty much all speculation and too far out on a limb to outline such hypothetical within the China section, better to just mention the hypothetical possibility of docking as a point of interest and move on with the now and is. The location of the hypothetical docking would be subject to political pressures, like if ESA and RSA forced america to agree, by no longer provisioning services like transport, then it would be ROS docking, but if the US and China made up it would be an american module docking, and so forth, hardware would be provisioned to reflect the nature of the political decision.

 How does this apply to an Internet Browser Add-on?

Unsourced Awards

First of all, thank you  and  for being fair and reasonable in regards to my edits to the Filmography section for this page.  I'm glad this page is finally starting to look like the others of its type found on Wikipedia.  

In regards to """"unsourced and ridiculous awards"""", I have sources for them, as you will see below, and they're not ridiculous.  For example, Meryl Streep's page has her NOMINATED for the National Society of Film Critics Award for Best Actress for The Iron Lady.  This means she ranked in one of the top 5-10 slots for said award, though she didn't win the award itself.  If you peruse her awards section, you will find many critics circle awards she did not win, but was """"nominated"""" for and the same applies to these awards.  This is common not just on Ms. Streep's page, but on other actors/actresses pages as well.  Nonetheless, I've made a compromise by removing Ms. Lange's actual rankings and replacing them """"Nominated"""" as per Ms. Streep's and others' pages.

""""By 2001 however Ethiopia, having in effect won the war with Eritrea, had regained this all-important strip of territory. Seeye wanted, for obvious reasons, to retain it; or at least to negotiate guaranteed rights of access to the sea""""

How is the above sentence correct actually it was eritrea who was militarily in a stronger position.

Furtheremore its highly offensive it dismiss the United Nations Observer Mission to Verify the Referendum in Eritrea. Eritreans had a Referendum and 99.79% voted for indepedence.

The quoted comment from the Siye abraha article is factally wrong and lacks considerations for FACTS.

 Blatant Racist editing 

Hi Mentifisto

You kindly acted on a report just now of vandalism on Sol Campbell [diff] by  User talk:86.153.188.51. I thought such blatant racist editing would receive an immediate block as per 
Wikipedia:No personal attacks rather than just a 1st level warning. Please can you advise how I should act in future, many thanks  
Well, in that case the edit had been made some time prior and the latest was not clear vandalism so the IP may have possibly be reassigned but generally I think it's best to give them a  warning so as to prepare them.  fisto 
Hi Mentifisto, Thanks for your feedback and I am truely sorry to trouble you again but I am left even more confused and need to know where to refer to to get an understanding of the line is drawn on racism on Wikipedia. The IP used the term stupid n*****r (in caps) at 20:38 on 16th May. This to me is just as bad as it gets. I reported this to WP:AIV at 21:19 and you applied the warning at 21:20. I can only assume you looked at the later edit to Didier Zokora which was not obviously that offensive to me at least. Thanks   
I am also a little confused. I agree that there is a fine line in dealing with personal attacks. I simply would like this line pointed out so that we will know how to deal with it in the future. Thanks,   
Well, I think it's down to individual discretion; blocks are preventive, so if the IP is unlikely to commit another similar edit in the next ten minutes or so it'd be somewhat redundant. Personally I'd give them the above immediate final warning so they know the consequences of their actions.  [[User talk:Mentifisto|",0,0,0,0,0,0

Sorry, but you go to far in protecting IronDuke.  I haven't edited the page in question since you asked me to stop, but you allow him to replace the attack.

This situation clearly qualifies.  And WP:RPA says that I can refactor to eliminate the personal attack.  I have done so.  It isn't an edit war.  In any case, you can stop it by the simple act of telling IronDuke to stop accusing me of being a sockpuppet.  If he had evidence or you thought it was true, I would be banned by now, no doubt.

Language in Saskatchewan
Correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that the 1988 Mercure decision held that Article 110 of the  North West Territories Act determined that Saskatchewan was bilingual.  In a context in which jurisdiction over language rights not specified by the Charter is undetermined, this means a conflict between Bill 2 and the North West Territories Act exists.  From the CanLII website:  """"Article 110 embodies procedural rules that give rights to individuals and, in fact, those rules are to some extent framed in terms of rights.  They are language rights or language guarantees as all the cases in this Court from Jones to Société des Acadiens make clear.  Section 110 was not entrenched after the Saskatchewan Act was passed.  This, like the continuation of s. 110, is entirely in accord with the legislative history of these provisions.  Many of the questions raised about the reach of the protections like those accorded under s. 110 have already been determined in recent cases before this Court either under s. 133  of the Constitution Act, 1867, s. 23 of the Manitoba Act, 1870, or ss. 16-18 of the Charter.  All of these provisions are differently drafted but they use similar expressions and there has been a marked tendency to give them a similar interpretation.  Section 110 was obviously modelled on s. 133.  The language rights accorded by s. 110 are substantially the same as those accorded under these other provisions: R. v. Mercure, 1988 IIJCan 107 (C.S.C.), [1988] 1 S.C.R. 234; Paquette v. A.G. Canada and A.G. Alberta, 1990 CanLII 37 (S.C.C.), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1103.""""

And the New School is pretty unorthodox with a mixture of Marxian and Post-Keynsian economists. While it does think folks like Jevons and Walras insightful I don't think it considers folks like Ricardo or Marx ignorant at all. And if you read down to Paretian Revival some of the issues in the quote are addressed. However. We can put something like the quote in the criticism section: that utility is unobservable. that utility is not measurable (this is actually realistic in my opinion - the difference between cardinal and ordinal utility). that utility is generally untestable (though predictions derived from marginal theory certainly are).

Whoa.  I really lost you here.  The affine space was only an analogy.  I do not want to construct something new, only show that there are two classes in common usage: Clifford ring (my name) and Clifford algebra; furthermore, that some inaccuracy occurs because they are not adequately distinguished.  All I'm saying is that there exists a class of objects (Clifford ring) in which no specific subspace is necessarily known as the generating vector space V.  You can hide the identity of the subspace V (and the grading) by """"mysterious relabelling"""".  But here is the point: this relabelling truly does hide which of the basis vectors span V; it is possible to form a product for every element in the ring, but impossible to identify the original subspace V used in the construction.  The quaternions are a ring isomorphic to Cℓ0,2(ℝ), which has a 1,2,1 grading structure.  Yet, given ℍ, can you find a unique decomposition with this grading structure?  No.  In a CA, grading specifically refers to a unique/natural decomposition into (I think it is into a direct sum of) 0-vectors, 1-vectors, 2-vectors etc.  talkcontr 19:22""",0,0,0,0,0,0

I seem to recall RJ saying it was his intention to release the last book as a single book even if needed a new form of book binding to be invented or sold on library carts. If I recall correct, then I can’t help but feel this is NOT at all what he intended to happen.

I can wait for it be bound into a single handcover book. In fact, if that simple intent can’t be honoured, I have to wonder about the story line itself.

Anyone who believes this staggered three volume release is being done for anything other than profit is kidding themselves. If it is not about profits release all three volumes at once, don’t wait for the money that will be generated from three separate hard cover and paperback releases for each volume.

Releasing this in three volumes is a terrible and sad idea. Readers of the wheel of time series have been waiting 15 plus years to a conclusion to this extraordinary series.

Consider this Harriet has no control over this book other then an editorial opinion if TOR books decides to replace something they can and will. More then likely there was a large advance granted to mr jordan upon the start of the book and unless the book is finished Harriet more then likely would have had to return that money due tyo the book being unfinished. Sorry folks but medical bills aren’t cheap and when some Corporation has you under contract you have no choice but to at least pretend you have some sort of control. Face it this is a business and the world is in a recession what is the garunteed way to bring in SOME MONEY? Plump up a story and add meaningless splits and’ milk it for everything it is worth, Corporate GREED at its finest again. don’t punish Harriet and not buy the books but BOYCOTT ANY OTHER WORK BY TOR OR SANDERSON UNTIL THE LAST VOLUME IS COMPLETE.

War crimes are serious violations of the laws of war.  The key words here are """"laws"""" and """"war.""""  Unless one lives in a corrupt town, laws are made by legislatures, or in this case ratified by them, after being written and argued over by diplomats in consultation with their military's generals.  The laws of war were written with the understanding that killing large numbers of people may be a legitimate and necessary part of that process.

Reply from ColonelHenry
I have been pissed this week, I admit. Why?
 First, last week, I get harassed by one hypocritical """"rule nazi"""" editor taking things too far (SummerPhD) so when I pointed out her similar shortcomings and intransigence and said frankly """"this user is an asshole"""" and explain why and state """"this is the kind of user that drives editors away from wikipedia"""" I get blocked for 24-hours.  I say """"asshole"""" once, I get blocked.  She calls me a """"dick"""" over a dozen times, and gets warned.  Go figure. I hate nitpicking rule nazis because they end up proving themselves to be hypocrites, and unfortunately without fool other meek fools who tend to be admins tend to side with the rule nazi.
 In the midst of that Daniel Case continued to plow ahead insisting on a rushed revision of ALONJ that no one else raised as a concern (so, not immediately dire) after being asked first politely and respectfully several times to """"wait until after TFA"""" and he still ignored it.  If someone politely asked me to wait a few days before doing a drastic edit on an article they worked on that was getting a little attention, I would...because I find it akin to telling a concert pianist to change their entire concert programme an hour before the recital. Only when I responded in anger did he pull back on the reins and realize """"hey, maybe I should wait till after TFA.""""  A little deference on his part would have gone a long way.  I'm not averse to his edits, but seriously, after TFA would have been more than fine.  I considered it insulting, and his refusal to listen to a polite request stated by both myself and the other major contributor to the article was considerably disrespectful.
 And then when the article I've worked on becomes TFA we get inundated with constant vandalism and petty edits that were not necessary (i.e. people like you, Kevjonesin, insisting on 19th instead of nineteenth).  Is that really a necessary place to make a stand and pick a fight? Seriously, don't you have better things to do with your time?  I'd rather argue over an analysis of Hegel's influence on Nietzsche's """"Will to Power"""" or Hindu mysticism in Eliot's Four Quartets than bicker about things as meaningless as whether honour should be spelled -or or -our.

As for why, I like """"nineteenth"""" as opposed to 19th, several style guides (including Chicago/Turabian) advocates it, and growing up I was taught that all numbers under 20 should be spelled out. Whether cutting two dozen letters from an article going to 19th and 20th is going to make a difference for """"brevity's sake"""" on a 40-page article, is a lame claim and frankly a waste of time for both of us. I like the aesthetic of it spelled out, it's allowed, and the option of spelling it out is a bonus in an article to avoid confusion with too many other numbers.  When considering such an unnecessary subjective edit, deference should be made to style set by the editors who spent months on an article...and when nothing is wrong to it, deference is entirely warranted.  That isn't ownership, it's just courtesy and good judgment. After all, if I stood in your yard while you were painting your house gray and proceeded to insist you to paint your house orange, you'd tell me to """"kick rocks.""""

As far as I'm concerned, this is over. Move on. I am not addressing this any further, because nonsense like this keeps me from contributing and convinces me to leave Wikipedia again, and this time for good. If Hell is other people, Wikipedia constantly proves itself to be the eighth and ninth circle.   """,1,0,1,0,0,0

I cannot believe that people are so deluded to think that this guy Richard Kastle deserves a damn wikipedia page. 

Why not give every single person who plays piano a page of their own... HELL, why not let anyone just put up a page about themselves. Not only was he previously featured in a video DAMNING deceased pianists about their playing (accusing them of simplifying the ending octave section of Liszts 2nd Hungarian Rhapsody), but hasn't done anything to deserve any special credit. Apart from his compositions which truly aren't anything brilliant - in fact, they're almost bland and boring (from a compositional point of view), he seems to ride on the credit of having played two compositions brilliant (which seems to be the deluded, sick, biased opinion of a guy called MikeCaffey on YouTube) when in fact his playing is sloppy and usually completely drowned in pedal, completely disturbing the balance of sound in the music. 

Now this deluded, sick individual on YouTube (MikeCaffey) seems to go about praising Dick (short for Richard, and far more funny to refer him to that, than Richard) for his compositions, deleting valid posts by real pianists and piano players alike, possibly in an effort to sweeten the image of Dick to others. As a pianist myself, I can safely say that playing the end of Liszts Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 in c sharp minor brilliantly does not alleviate ones status to piano-god, and even if it did Dick STILL wouldn't be a piano God since he seems intent on drowning the ending with pedal, completely destroying the cleanliness of the parading octaves. 

Letting this slanderous leech of the musical world have a wikipedia page seems insulting to other pianists who truly have talent. Although they may not care whether they have a page or not, I find it insulting to the profession of pianism that Dick has a page of his own.

Vandalism Manifesto. Pass to all Wikians

VANDALISM IS GOOD. Vandalism does not come from a sheer desire to cause harm.
Vandals do their thing all over Wiki, 24/7, from frustration and hatred, 
because incompetent """"editors"""" who have no skills, no degrees, no expertise, usually no names, have done multiple reverts and edits of the work of others.
Vandalism is a good and natural response to no-lifers (as in Get a Life) who 
do 7000 edits, 10,000 edits a year and who have actual Watch Lists of 1,300
or more and are proud of it. These jerks deserve have their own pages vandalized, over and over as long as they are in effect, vandalizing the pages of others in the name of being a cop. Vandals keep no-life editors, admins, 
bureaucrats and stewards honest, or at least busy, reverting the reverts they get on their own pages. VANDALISM IS GOOD. It helps drive these nutcases into the ground with nervous breakdowns. The Culture of Wikipedia is very,very sick,
and Vandals are needed to """"cull the herd"""". SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL VANDAL.

It seem sto me that th eoriginal noble aims of the founders have gone adrift due to the smallminded pettyness of many contributors.

They usually manifest this smallminded ignorance by deleting any correction to their original articles as seemingly their godliness means the are the supreme authority on most topics even if as is the frequent case they live in some little place in USA ad have no real knowledge of life beyond the stripmalls.   

Constant ingestion of burgers and fries makes them feel to be experts on all things even those of which they know nothing and have n personal experience of.  Thus when I spot an inconsitency in their pieces and add some correct and especially logical words to their precious piece they get their knickers in a twist and childishly erase my effort and thus leave all other Wiki readers just as ignorant as they themselves.

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!

One of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.

I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.

The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.

Keith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a """"Mutt and Jeff"""" in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1"""" but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.

Karen and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.

We were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.

""""There were some really desperate people here tonight,"""" she said. """"Can you believe Gary tried to get a game of Spin the Bottle going?""""

""""I can't say I really blame him,"""" I answered with a grin. """"Not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends, or any girlfriend for that matter. Hell, I wouldn'd mind playing it now!"""" That earned me a poke in the ribs from Karen.

Sue chimed in, """"Why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like Spin the Bottle, Post Office, or Strip Poker?""""

""""Now that's a stupid question,"""" Keith answered.

""""And why is that?"""" Linda asked, pointedly.

""""Isn't it obvious?"""" Keith replied.

""""No."""" Linda and Sue answered in unison.

""""Do you want to tell them?"""" Keith asked me with a nod.

So I explained the obvious. """"Because they ARE desperate - and sometimes it works.""""

""""Oh please!"""" Karen said.

Keith was a real instigator. """"You guys have never played Spin the Bottle?""""

The girls looked at each other. """"Maybe a few times, but certainly not in the last year."""" Linda finally answered.

""""And how about Truth or Dare?"""" Keith continued egging them on.

""""Well sure, but usually only with people we know really well,"""" Karen answered this time.

""""Usually."""" Keith echoed with a grin. """"And it's not like you've never played Strip Poker.""""

The girls looked at each other quietly no one answering.

""""Oh come on,"""" I teased, """"Karen I know you've played Strip Poker.""""

""""Not really. I watched part of a game, but then they chased everyone not playing out of the room. Why? I suppose you've played it?"""" She asked with a dangerous tone in her voice.

""""Sort of. In camp we started a game but it got raided before we got anywhere."""" I confessed, drawing a laugh from the guys. """"L",1,0,1,0,1,0
